      "In the last 18 months alone, [25 million new investors joined the stock market](https://twitter.com/km/status/1486549470061891591), and at their peak, retail investors [made up more than 25%](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/retail-investors-quarter-of-stock-market-coronavirus-volatility-trading-citadel-2020-7-1029382035) of the U.S. stock market. But as more people earnestly participate in the markets than ever before, the opacity and complexity of markets has left them concerned that: markets are not adequately providing price discovery; that too much power is concentrated in too few firms; and that they cannot trust such a complex system that lacks appropriate transparency. \n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaps created by the lack of meaningful competition, transparency and simplicity have resulted in [billions of dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/payments-to-u-s-brokers-surged-amid-meme-stock-and-options-boom-11643745771) in annual Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) made from high-speed trading firms to brokers, while these firms generate multiples of this in revenue. These companies face little competition and amass greater market power, as two of these firms are responsible for a huge share of trading, both on-exchange and off. PFOF creates an intractable conflict-of-interest for brokers whose financial incentives are placed at odds with their duty of best execution. The segmentation of retail order flow away from lit markets means less competition and materially wider spreads as exchange toxicity increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "**We are writing to urge you to address PFOF and the disparities in market structure that lead to excessive off-exchange trading as a top priority, and propose a rule that will truly reform our markets, not simply result in more disclosure.** Included in this, we need regulatory intervention to repair a system that results in inferior execution quality for retail and institutional investors, and that has damaged markets and widened spreads for all participants. The SEC needs to take action to change the current market structure, rejuvenate the price discovery process, incentivize diversity and competition, and simplify our markets. While there is no silver bullet to fixing markets, we believe that a holistic approach can solve many problems. Such an approach would also consider exchange rebates and access fees, intelligent tick sizes, an order-by-order best execution standard, incentives to reduce fragmentation of markets (e.g., ending the subsidization of exchanges with SIP revenue), and ensuring that the NBBO properly reflects all supply and demand in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "PFOF and excessive off-exchange trading persist because so many trading platforms rely on the revenue it generates, essentially productizing their clients. Defenders of PFOF have claimed that retail brokers who route to high-speed traders (in exchange for PFOF) provide better price execution for investors and that it’s a net positive, despite creating an inherent misalignment between these platforms and their customers, and despite [public evidence](https://medium.com/the-public-blog/delivering-on-price-execution-without-pfof-27f0e6098a2f) to the contrary. Leaning on the flawed argument that they categorically provide retail customers with best price execution quality, there is little by way of self-regulation to foment change or prevent applications designed to optimize transaction volume (i.e. speculation and day trading) and risky activity (i.e. margin and options trading). Further, their ability to claim best execution is part of the flaw of the system, as even within the current structure better outcomes are possible on an order-by-order, and aggregated basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout 2021, the debate around PFOF only grew with a House of Representatives [bill to ban the practice](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5.06.2021_bills-1171pih-actof2021-order.flow.pdf), and a Senate bill introduced as the [‘Investor Freedom Act of 2021’](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/investor_freedom_act_of_2021.pdf) to prevent such a ban and protect PFOF profiteers. We also understand that the issue of PFOF is top-of-mind for you, having made several public comments raising concerns about the practice, the resulting concentration of power, the misalignment of incentives and the flawed standard of best execution.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there is a groundswell of support voicing their concerns related to PFOF, excessive off-exchange trading, and rallying behind comprehensive reform to market structure. On March 3, an investor advocacy coalition spearheaded by investing information company Urvin Finance, comprehensive fractional investing platform Public.com, institutional equities execution platform Proof Trading, and others, launched and published an [Investor Bill of Rights](https://www.urvin.finance/advocacy) in a call for comprehensive market reforms that will empower individual investors. While this coalition is being guided by these firms, the movement is based on grassroots advocacy and the education and empowerment of individual investors. This coalition of investors is guided by five core principles of: Transparency, Simplicity and Fairness, Investor Choice and Control, Best Execution, and Better Settlement and Clearing. We believe that individual investors can better represent their own interests than the companies who productize them.\n",

My friends are the kind of people who always want a reason as to why you cant hang out with them, and just saying \"because i dont feel like it\" is not enough for them and almost force me to go out,( especially when they come to my house because then I have to say yes because it’s either awkward saying no, or my mom encourages me to go out.)\n",

When's the last time you had any special time with a lady and the smell of last night's meal wafts up from her dirty asshole because our polymers aren't space-age or the loom was misaligned that day? Oh, you were watching \"American Idol\" last night and didn't have time to do the motility tests? Sorry I don't know who the winner of that show will be, but I know the loser. It's the American consumer. Like little Timmy Wilson who was seen by classmates digging for buried treasure and is now the laughingstock of Central Elementary. Doris Goldberg, whose white skirt was ruined because you didn't feel like writing every detail about Rat # 4 that day. Pastor John Wad who, for the love of all that's holy, had a breakthrough incident last Thursday and ended up three fingers deep into his own asshole? The man took a vow of chastity you unfeeling bastard. So help me God, if you don't start showing more interest in your work I am going to hire some asshole off the street. You build an Excel spreadsheet, you log the Monkey and Rat numbers in one row, the condition of their buttholes in the next and then each day you put in your observations, is that so hard? Take a picture of each ass, close up so we can observe signs of itching, scratching, etc and collate those with the spreadsheet. Using the q-tip, you smear some of each subjects' fecal matter onto the \"F\" column. Do i have to spell it all out for you dumbass? Now get out of here before I change my mind.\n",
      "Hey guys, do you know that in terms of male human and “female” Digimon breeding, Jellymon is the most compatible Digimon for Kiyoshiro? Not only she is a data type, which is composed of very adaptive Digimon, Jellymon is a very squishy mollusk Digimon with the whole body flexible, this means she will easily be able to handle Kiyoshiro’s dick, and with her impressive Battle Mode, him can even be in “Limit Break” that she will take it all. Due to Jellymon’s mostly water based body, there’s no doubt in my mind that she aroused would be incredibly wet, so wet that Kiyoshiro could easily have sex with his beloved jellyfish for hours without getting sore. She also have this cute gremlin look, along with the fact that she also have impressive thick thighs for her size, talking about size, just imagine how tight she is being a midget like that, don’t forget the slimy tentacles, they are capable of effortless reach Kiyoshiro’s prostate, so it’d be incredibly easy for him to get in the “mood”. With her Signature Moves: Bibi Thunder and Volt Knuckle, she can easily recover Kiyoshiro’s member from “Integer Overflow” with electrical stimulation. No other Digimon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if Kiyoshiro pull out enough, he can make Jellymon turn white. Jellymon is literally built for Kiyoshiro’s dick. Being ungodly strong-willed like a queen means she can take his cock all day without giving up, since she hates to lose and enjoys human activities, Jellymon tries to take part in them as if they were a game, she will never let her \\~♡\\~Darling\\~♡\\~ “win” their “intimate competition”, she will do it in all positions imaginable and still come for more. Note this is only for her Jellymon form, we haven't even started talking about her further 3 evolutions yet…\n",

      "So I'll be the one to ask. I have a really strong dislike for the kids. I don't want to go into detail about the kids because I don't want to make it too long, but basically they are shit. They can't control themselves and always run up to me, scream at me, run up to the other kids, and just do whatever they can to get my attention because I'm a \"good parent\". They also scream and are very loud. They're so loud that my boyfriend is not at all bothered by them. I have to turn my volume up to hear them because they are so loud. My boyfriend does not like the kids. He complains about them but I'm always the one to say that I'm tired of hearing about them. My boyfriend also doesn't want them in the car (we live in the city and he has to drive me) but they always sneak into the car after I let them in (I've told him about how they are too loud in the car and they are making it hard to drive because they are always jumping around or running up to me). I've also asked him to take out his anger on the kids. He would never ever do it. I would be the one that gets yelled at and called names. So I'm wondering, am I the asshole?\n",
      " I forgive Carson for putting the things He did in the past. Because  honestly, my mom was 19 and my dad was 18 when they were married. They  were dating for 4 years prior even. So thats why I dont think what He  did is criminal because anyone who was born in the 1980s and back knows  that society today is fucked in so many ways. Not to mention the actual  fucking apochalypse in 2030 during winter. I had a feeling that the  world would end someday, just not in my lifetime. I have Lilith here  too, She may be Lucifers wife but She is good towards me and cares about  me especially when I am sick or crying over a lost loved one, She is  there for me. She has done more good than actual harm to me and She  knows I care about Her because of what She suffered by Adams hand. She  protects me like a mother to a child would. Believe me, If She wanted to  harm me, She would  have done it already but She hasnt. She normally  just talks to me in my dreams and thats about it. To me, She isnt evil,  because She is no where near the Lilith described in the Zohar.\n",

      "So it’s about 2am and was about to have my ritual before bed wank. Found a video and went to put my airpods in. As it turns out, they auto connected to my dads phone in the living room for whatever reason (guess he was using them last). I didn’t notice this as i got the normal connection sound and all 😂😂. So turns out my phone auto connected to my neighbours big bluetooth speaker system , which i connected to a few times on accident before so it decided to auto connect now. (i live in an apartment on the first floor, 2 other apartments and their balconies right next to our one, so sound tends to echo pretty bad). I hit play on the video and for the first 10 seconds i heard nothing obviously, and right as they got into the ‘loud’ part i turned up my volume to the max😂😂😂…It was like this for about 30 seconds before i realised (airpods have noise cancelling)i could hear it outside VERY fuxking loudly once i took them off. It sounded like club speakers absolutely BLASTING in the peaceful 2am silence of 30 full seconds of loud porn noises. I honestly couldn’t fucking stop laughing into my pillow and it was by far one of the funniest moments of my life 😂😂 poor fucking neighbours from all three apartment blocks😭😭i heard a couple people yell “stfu” and “are you fuckinnn seriousss” 😂😂\n",

When you went to the barber you must have tipped him greatly, just for him to stop laughing when you asked for that inept trim.

      "One day while Andy was masturbating, Woody got wood. He could no longer help himself! He watched as Andy stroked his juicy kawaii cock. He approached Andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the floor and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever! Woody: \"Andy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU.\" Andy: \"Oh Woody Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!\" Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored lube and rubbed it all over his head Woody: \"Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite! Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Andy: \"Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: \"No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full! All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged. The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys.\n",
      "So I found a Romanian restaurant in Romania 🇷🇴, and I went there and took a look at the menu and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the menu,past the soups 🍜 and 🥗salads and sandwiches 🥪, I found the most crazy thing. It was so crazy I nearly spat out my Coca Cola and mug root beer 🍺 combo with 1/5 carbon dioxide to drink ratio that I received complimentary from the restaurant, but back to the story, at the very bottom of the menu I saw what could only be described as horrifying, terrorizing, and traumatizing. At the bottom of the menu, was a cheeseburger 🍔 with the option of a soup 🍜 or a salad 🥗 as a side. I couldn’t believe my eyes, I thought 💭 they were illegal. So I went outside to call the police 👮‍♂️ to see if the burger 🍔 was in fact, illegal, and wouldn’t you know it, they said it was. So the police came over to the restaurant to have a  look 👀  and they confirmed that it was indeed, a burger 🍔. I was flabbergasted 😮. So they went into the back and arrested the 14 cooks, 5 waiters, 2 waitresses, and a centipede. They all went to court to testify and they were all found guilty. The centipede even pled guilty to second degree murder. So the police force of Romania 🇷🇴 thanked me for my work and gave me $500. So I left Romania 🇷🇴 the next day, and the entire police force was on the tarmac waving goodbye to me as I flew off into the sunset towards home, $500 and a burger 🍔 in my hand, gliding through the sky.\n",

      "Hank The Tank, an international treasure. The bear, the myth, the legend. On February 20th, 2022, The New York Times published an article titled “Hank The Tank, a 500 Pound Bear, Ransacks a California Community”, simultaneously slandering Hank the bear and skyrocketing him to international fame. That’s Hank. The Accusations against Hank. He has been accused of breaking into 28 Californian homes since July. He has been accused of stealing leftovers, especially leftover pizza. And he has been accused of being 500 lbs. because he eats too much pizza. Is this man a criminal? In Hank’s defense, the Californians deserve it. Bears can have a little pizza as a treat. He can have a little pizza in my opinion. He is a victim of hate crimes. “Local police have tried to “haze” the bear with paintballs, beanbags, sirens and Tasers” says the NYT. Authorities began “Trying to trap Hank and possibly euthanize him.” I think these are bear hate crimes. Hank the victim. He is Multiple!! On February 25th, 2022, the NYT published an article called “DNA Evidence Reveals Hank the Tank Isn’t One Bear, but Several”. Per the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, “DNA evidence collected over the past several months showed that at least three bears were involved in the break-ins that had been reported in the Lake Tahoe area in California and Nevada.” Three of him. He has been Exonerated!! Hank will not be euthanized. “The department said it would work in the coming weeks and months to trap, tag and study them and then release them into more suitable habitats.” I think the department should mind their own fucking business. He’s a cool guy, please leave him alone. Why we should leave Hank and his associates alone: they are pretty cool guys, They are national heroes, They are victims of bear hate crimes. According to Lake Tahoe residents “They had been perfectly fine houseguests, aside from the food theft and trail of destruction left behind.”. “He just sits there and eats.” Ann Bryant, executive director of the Bear League, a wildlife rescue service in Homewood California, said this week. “He doesn't attack them. He doesn't growl. He doesn’t make rude faces”. It was a gated community that called the police on him 100 times since July. He is a polite man that is a victim of rich people. Hank, my beloved. Free my homie Hank, He didn’t do shit.\n",

      "Hey guys did you know what is the best thing to have as a girlfriend? Of course its gonna be a snake.. im not promoting bestiality of any kind but think about it. You can cuddle with her all day if you wanted to, because of the shape, you could also use her as like an anxiety blanket however this is kinda pointless because all it takes is just a little bit more pressure before every bone in your body begins to crush and break. This is.. however kinky if you are in to that sort of thing and hence brings up my next topic. FUCKING! Now having consensual sex with a snake is going to be a real challange, let alone finding one that can handle human cocks. But if you get lucky you are in for a real ride. First snakes do not have a vagina and asshole. They have this thing called a cloaca, so it may be a little tight to get into but if youre okay with that, you are in for a really hot night with your serpentine girlfriend wink. Fucking her juicy snake hole while she coils around you and passionately kissing you with her split tongue wrapped around yours and soaking in sweat. Good thing is that they are cold blooded so its a fair share of heat and cold. Next is finnaly cumming into her after long minutes of thrusting in and out of her. You are going to finnaly succumb to her wet pink snake pussy.

      "The iphone alarm clock is literal shit. Look, every evening I charge my phone to 100% then unplug it because I heard that overcharging your phone is not good for the battery life. I set my alarm for 7 am sharp, then I turn off my phone to preserve the battery because it drops 10% overnight. Come the next morning the alarm doesnt go off, I’m late to work. My boss calls me into his office. I’m hoping its for the promotion I’ve been working extra hard to get, but NO, I get fired because I look too much like his cheating ex wife. So I make a complaint to HR and she said she cant do anything because she understands that I look just like her. So I go home sad to break the news to my husband, but instead I come home to my husband sleeping with my boss. At this point, I’m ready to give up. I sit down and place my head between my knees and let out a giant scream. I hear glass shatter. I look up, I’m in a room surrounded by mirrors. Now I’m panicking, breathing hard, I hear a loud siren go off, at last its my alarm clock and I wake up 15 minutes past my alarm and now I’m going to be stuck in traffic.\n",

      "It began in early 2019. I want to say it started in Season 8, but it was more like half-way through Season 7. The first time Epic took a \"break\" for the holidays and dropped the Overtime styles. Think about it. Season 7 started off normally, besides the planes and the uncessary graphics alterations. Then, something happened. The Infinity Blade was released. Boom boxes which destroyed builds. There was a Marshmello concert and a skin, the first of *many* collaborations to come. Something changed. This was not the same game as before. It didn't stop there. Season 8 ruined the graphics, and I have a theory that Chapter 2 was already planned at this point, and the reason for the graphics downgrades were to help players \"transition\" into the mobile game-tier Chapter 2 graphics more easily. Allow me to explain. If you were to go straight from Season 6 to Season 11, the quality decrease in the lighting would be impossible not to notice immediately. Gradually ruining the lighting a few seasons before Season 11 fixes that. I believe that this was Epic's nefarious plan. I know Chapter 2 was in development around Season 8 because it was that season that the Loot Lake vault was uncovered. This location obviously was a key part in Donald Mustard's Zero Point storyline. The same storyline that led to the destruction of Fortnite. The moment Tilted Towers was destroyed, I knew Fortnite was doomed. The old Epic would *never* do such a thing. No, this was a new Epic. An Epic led by Donald Mustard, who cared not about OG Fortnite and its fans, but rather collaborations and nonsensical storylines. Is that what a battle royale game is about? It doesn't matter. Not anymore. In Season X, the collaborations had become out of hand. An advertisement was sitting on top of Tilted's grave. I was disgusted. These crossovers were no longer simply skins or events. They were affecting the map. Epic shared their \"philosophy\" of allowing unskilled players an advantage over skilled players through overpowered and unbalanced weapons. This was in response to the backlash over the mechs. The old Epic did not think this way. The old Epic kept Fortnite fair and balanced. This was a new Epic. Donald Mustard's Epic. Overpowered and unbalanced items had been plaguing the game as far back as Season 7 with the Infinity Blade, planes and boom boxes. 2019 is when it all began. 2019 is when Fortnite ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donald Mustard wasn't content with turning our beloved game into an advert-infested abomination. His hunger for destruction could not be sated so easily. Fortnite was unrecognisable by the time Season X was coming to a close, but this wasn't good enough. Donald had to destroy the game completely, to wipe it from existence. So that's what he did. Chapter 2 marked the official death of Fortnite. This new \"chapter\" was more than an update. It was a new game. The art style, the feeling, everything about Season 11 was as far away from OG Fortnite as you could get. The new map was vastly inferior to the old one in every aspect. The graphics were hideous, like something out of a mobile game. I used to think Creative Destruction looked like a cheap knock off of Fortnite. Chapter 2 was like a cheap knock off of Creative Destruction. That's how far away from real Fortnite it was. The quality of skins took a dive. As bad as Season 9 and X's cosmetics were, when it came to bad skins, Chapter 2 took the biscuit. Overpowered weapons were everywhere. Collaborations were clearly the main focus. The worst part about all of this is that the playerbase ate it up. They didn't complain about Chapter 2 being of vastly lower quality than the so-called \"Chapter 1\". Nobody complained about the lighting downgrades. Nobody cared that the art style was completely abadoned, the tone of the game was completely off. Fortnite's playerbase is full of morons. Chapter 2 was the end of Fortnite, and it was all Donald Mustard's fault. Donald Mustard RUINED Fortnite.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all quite concerning. Fear not, for it is not hopeless. Fortnite can be ressurrected, but changes are going to need to be made in both the game and Epic themselves. Donald has to go. I'm sorry, but he's clearly shown he has no interest in the preservation of games. He destroyed Fortnite, he left Save the Word to die and he likely destroyed Paragon as well. This is dangerous. You do not want such an individual in a games company. Chapter 2 should have been a separate game and OG Fortnite should never have been destroyed. All of Donald's creation, everything added in 2019 and onward, must be removed. The old map, the old graphics and everything that made Fortnite great in 2017 and 2018 must return, and the new developers must maintain the identity of this game until the end of time. The preservation of OG Fortnite must be their top priority. If they pull a Donald and try to make changes to the core mechanics or the art style, we as a community and stand up and say one word that Donald Mustard has likely never heard in his life... \"No!\"\n",

      "Every time my friend comes over, he always asks to watch gay porn on the 65-inch TV with my mom. I always tell him no, and out of retaliation, he ejaculated on me several times. Sometimes, at school, he watches gay porn on his porn on his phone and jacks off. Everyt8me I try to say I don't want to be friends anymore, he stuff my face with his shit and cum. I hate him so much and get made fun of for being his friend. And one day I cam home and my sister was pregnant and I started freaking out and wondering who. Then it hit,me a giant slchong slapped across my face, it my my friend. After that he proceeded to impregnate my mom while watching gay porn on the big screen.\n",
      "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn't do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it's hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn't want to let that fish go, I couldn't let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I'd use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him \"It's not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank\". My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can't speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What's even worse is that I can't Jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn't do it for me anymore. There's no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don't like fish as a food that much, I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I'l never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it. AND THIS MY ORIGIN STORY\n",

      " Greetings. My name is Beef, and today I would like to present an exceedingly excellent 'your mother' joke. I will now begin.  Your biological mother is so morbidly obese, when she went to get her yearly physical done, the doctor took her blood and the results concluded that she had a high blood pressure, onset type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and the possibility of heart disease. She also suffers from severe depression because she lacks confidence in herp physical appearance, which enables her to consume even more food, making her more obese. Not to mention, but your mother is becoming *so* monstrous, she had a hard time fitting through small spaces and exceeding weight limits on practical applications. Your mother has an endless cycle of malicious eating habits that only make her health worsen over time.  I hope whoever has just watched this video enjoyed the humorous 'your mother' joke. Thank you for your time and have a blessed day.\n",

So a year ago, my family and me went to super market, then my brother ask me if I want some Cheetos for school lunch, then I said yeah sure, then the ext day me and my brother went to school and we prepare Cheetos for lunch. And we ate some Cheetos, then the scary things that… we became black… so.. don’t… eat…”Cheetos” anymore….\n",
      "just stop being a crybaby and accept that genders, genitaries, etc ain't shit, they're like not even 1/5 of our body,  they serve no purpose for our own bodies, just to create new ones, tell me right now which part of our body do you think is bigger, actually think and is ourselves: our brain or the entirety of our genital system (not counting dick size, only if its the how much of a dick you are). and all of the hormone and gender differences are not just worthless but cause more harm than good now that we're no longer in the middle of the food chain and we don't need to have ones focused on protecting their own specie while others take care of the young, and sexual pleasure is just a way of nature to keep farming us, from a point of view of course, of course that its just an evolutionary way of making us continue getting laid, not like if most of us would actually want to raise a new life, there's already way more than 7 billion of us in the world the last thing we need is more, i can't go anywhere (outside my own home) without having more than 1000 people infesting that place, even in nature all of this gender bullshit is more harmful than helpful, many animals kill their own for the mere purpose of feeling sexual pleasure like once, even drugs might be a less harmful way of pleasing and addicting yourself at this point, i hope all of these gender differences take the same end as the appendix and the last 4 teeth which our ancestors had so people can stop being mistreated just because of the way they've never choosed to be born as (not saying that the way you've been born is good or bad of course, just saying that you've never choosed the gender or any other way you've been born with and its not fair to pass through anything different through your life exclusively because of that)\n",

I mean I don't really blame you for that there aren't really many things you can associate Canada with after all. \n",

      "About the people, well the people are honesty some of the most sad and pathetic people I've ever dared to socialize with. Their fake smiles and boring superficial kindness can be sensed from miles away, almost like they want you to know they are being fake.\n",
      "\n",
      " Since most of the time they are reserved like an wild animal hiding it's wounds from predators, if you are lucky enough to meet and communicate with a Canadian in the wild, and actually manage to get over the superficial shallow small talk (doubt it), you'll soon start to get dizzy trying to filter out the real conversation from the sarcasm, passive aggressiveness and if they are making fun of you or not, and trust me, if you are starting to wonder, chances are, they are doing at least one of them, especially the passive aggressiveness and sarcasm. If you hear them talking tho, it's not the aggressive kind of sarcasm and passive aggressiveness, it's the sad, slimy pathetic one.  You kinda feel there is something fundamentally missing in Canadians, like a part of their soul has been ripped from them and replaced with deep seated resentment, envy, and vindictiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But even if you get to that, the conversation will mostly be relatively neutral. Canadians are *extremely* fragile people with an ego made of thin glass, and they assume others are like them. This creates a culture of conformity, where *noone* will risk the possibility of upsetting *anyone*. So most of your conversations with a Canadian will revolve around the weather and other similar non confrontational subjects. Arguments are a big nono, even if they are being done in good faith. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe is this due to the weather. I mean yes, now we have social programs and such, but in the past I'd doubt you'd want to create too many enemies when being kicked out of the tribe meant freezing to death in a matter of minutes. I bet everyone just kept their head low, tried not to draw too much attention, and that resulted in the stereotypical pushover \"sowwie\" Canadian. It's not kindness, it's smily, fake superficial kindness propably evolved over generations of nature and nurture doing their part. But don't worry tho, they won't hesitate talking behind your back.\n",

      "That might sound contradictory, and it's because it totally is. Canadians want to be perceived as kind and humble, but at the same time, they are the best country in the world, and their big brother US is the manifestation of evil. Nooo it doesn't matter that their number one trading partner is the USA, it doesn't matter that most jobs in Caanda are provided by USA based companies, it doesn't matter that basically most of the services like food, technology, military protection, and basically your entire existence as a country can be credited to the US economy, it doesn't matter that at this point, year by year, the cultural difference between Canada and USA is vastly becoming non existent, no matter how much Canadians will deny it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And I bet that's it. A big source of their inferiority complex that looks like a superiority one may come from fact that their much bigger, stronger, smarter and richer brother is better than them is so manny ways, to such a degree, that they are starting to swallow them from the inside out. And the Canadians who actually, for some weird reason, like their 'culture\", are showing their teeth like a sacred Chihuahua trapped between the couch and the Christmas tree by a 6 year old kiddo, who just wants to be pet it a bit. They are to egoistic to admit that the US has won.  They are in denial that their country, with the exception of selling bulk materials, is pretty much irrelevant to the rest of the world. \n",

Whether it is Chinese billionaires mass buying apartments, Americans imposing their culture, sucking out any brains Canada dares to produce and installing more us based companies, the French wanting to break apart, the Truckers in Ottawa, or angry young people without a roof over their head, not being able to afford the phone bill, Canada is losing it's grip and fast. It's starting to become difficult for them to justify their existence, over than \"we just do\". \n",

      "Canada is a great place for mediocre people who will achieve mediocre things, will live a mediocre life and die a mediocre death. Canadians are cowards, fragile, weak minded and suffer from the tall poppy syndrome, instead of focusing on THEIR country. When the Americans were taking risks and inventing stuff, Canadians were looking on how to make their life resemble that of a house cat. While the United States government allowed it's people to be free, and keept the barriers that prevent innovation and monetary grown low, the Canadian government looked on ways to further parent, infantilize and sheild their citizens from the outside world, which ironically is even failing to do just that. The USA is number one country with the most charitabe people in the world, and it shows, they are outspoken, genuinely friendly aren't afraid of conversations. Meanwhile Canadians are wet, cold, reserved alone in a Tim Horton's parking lot drinking their shitty coffee, scared they might not be able to pay their rent if they don't find a job in the US within a year. Oh and, they'll have to get up 20 minutes early to scape that ice of the car tomorrow and the day after, and the day after that.\n",

      "Okay so, I know this sub is inhabited with filthy, disgusting dreamphobes, but hopefully I can convince you all of why I think this way and am undoubtedly right. First off, Dream is by far the greatest content creator of all generations, he's extremely funny with his gut punching routine of screaming and yelling, this is not only hilarious but also keeps my and all of his other loyal supporters attention in check. There are some who would accuse him of being \"childish\" but I find it intensely helpful, as I and many other loyal dream fanatics had our fathers leave us at a young age meaning I can experience the father I never had through dream, and like he's stated many times on his twitter, he loves every single one of us, which basically makes us family. All of us sane people have caught on to dreams genius as not just a creator, but a true deity among men, who is more perfect than any could deserve, but there are still some losers (to refer to the christian bible, which has many similarities to dreams story, these filth would be known as sinners) who believe dream is somehow not the greatest creator of all, some even go as far to say he cheated in his speedrun due to his otherworldly luck, these fools clearly do not understand dream and how he is a truly blessed figure who can do no wrong, giving him perfect luck. As we all know, dream will surely take over control of the United states within the next few months due to his overwhelming appeal that not even Joe biden can match, soon the dream empire will conquer all countries until dream is the only ruler on earth, creating a true utopian society, ending all world hunger and disease as promised. The first order of the new dream regime will be to punish all of the evil dream deniers. You still have a few months to begin worship of dream to avoid this fate however. I will indeed rule the world alongside dream as he said he personally loves me and all his other subs (although I couldn't dare hope to be an equal to him), I shall be the ruler of the upper class, made up entirely of his loyal subs. The middle class will be formed by those who showed indifference towards dream (however they will be shortly converted). The final and lowest class will be made up of dream deniers, they will be placed in shabby, unsanitary houses and will quickly starve to death unless they convert to dreamology and become dreamsexuals like all others. This will then create a true utopian world in which no conflict will exist, all watched by our loving ruler, Dream Minecraft.\n",

The owner did NOT believe me; a fellow Dreamgender person. I was so mad that I punched my dream themed computer so hard. Then, I realized what i had done. I punched my daddy dream monitor.

      "After weeks of anticipation, wet socks attached to my feet I knew it was finally time. I sat down quickly, nearly jizzing in excitement as I could see all the foot fungus I had finally grown. It had been 2 years since I took off my socks, only taking off my socks once every 3 months, when this happened it let out an odor so bad that passing birds died surrounded by their own semen. I walked over in anticipation to my closest friend and an avid sex-haver. I steadied my bare feet as the weight was unusual and a new sensation. I hadn’t showered these feet even before I placed them into their wollen prison. They were filled with grime, cement, rocks and past semen from attempts to rub myself off using only my feet. I knocked on my buddy’s door, his sister opened it to quickly pass out from the smell of my sweaty amazon rainforest down below. I quickly paced myself before I made it into his room, holding back to make sure I didn't ejaculate prematurely. I opened and he gave me a devious look before licking his lips and then immediately going to the floor, opening his mouth wide, shoving both feet into his mouth, giving it a wash with his tongue and tickling my feet to my ecstasy. I fell onto the ground near immediately coming, but being the cum guzzler my buddy was he caught all of it into his mouth then proceeded to suck onto my feet, unable to hold myself back anymore I pulled down his pants and brought out his foot long schlong and shoved it all the way down my mouth, it felt so good sliding down my throat, suddenly I felt him go erect then his long schlong reached down  and touch my stomach acids burning it, from this he came and it felt so good to have his semen injecting into my stomach. I felt his cold, pale and clammy hands crawling into my pants roughly grabbing my cock and jerking me off still while sucking on my feet. We proceeded on like this for the next 5 hours, each time I cummed he caught it into his mouth, then quickly sucking my feet to make sure they don’t stop having a layer of saliva over the fungus, whenever he came I could feel my gastric acid burning his cock which only seemed to harden him up and suck even harder and faster. We soon finished, not seeing a bit of my cum in his room. I looked at my once fungus-filled foot now dry to only see the thousands of blisters I had collected, I looked at his cock which seemed to have halved in size with severe burns all over them. Exhausted and feeling good I was about to stand up and leave, when i felt some bile rising into my throat I quickly vomited all, which chunks of his cock falling back onto his remaining pieces fell back onto his base like Tetris pieces, before the nice part came up i grabbed duct tape and reattached them back properly, I then proceeded to vomit his cum all over his room, when i was done it looked as if all the snow in the world condensed and came into one place. I quickly ran out as he was still covered in his near digested semen. Running over dead corpses of people who had came to the lingering smell of my feet I went to the beach to collect as much rough sand, then to the swamp to collect its mud before forcing my dry cock to come one more time before forcing on socks into the concoction and putting my my dirty disgusting shoes I languished in knowing the next time this experience could come once more.\n",

Last but not least was the period, proving to myself that no matter how genius you may be, society will eventually make you conform to its standards. Truly a masterpiece.\n",

      "I beat a child. He was just staring at me with his big, stupid face while I ate my delicious 8oz steak. His snot flapping in his nostrils and his eyes blinking out of sync infuriated me. The final straw was when he had the audacity to take a drink of his chocolate milk with his stupid idiot lips. I took my steak knife, which was stained with steak sauce and juices, and I stabbed him in the eyeball 98 times. I then proceeded to dumb an entire bottle of ketchup into his mouth as he screamed in pain. It gurgled with the force of a volcano. Finally, he stopped breathing altogether, and his mother called the police. When the police arrived, I used my half-eaten steak to beat them both to death, then I ran out, stripped off all my clothes, and ran naked through the local daycare, screaming “98 STAB WOUNDS” until I finally was apprehended by the authorities. I am facing 13 life sentences without parole.\n",

      "So here are the reasons to me why minecraft is not fun anymore:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Change in the target demographic from teenagers/young adults to children.  This is good for the rapid growth of the game, however, it generally leads to a much more toxic and exploitative community.  It also leads to the popularisation of content creators that are much more infantile in their ways, i.e. Dream, Tommyinnit, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Addition of pointless updates that only serve to popularise the game.  Minecraft's updates have always been about adding things, I acknowledge this.  However, since the purchase by Microsoft, these updates have been more game changing every time.  For example, the addition of netherite armour without an increase in challenge level.  This leads to the game becoming less challenging.  Some may make the argument that Minecraft is not meant to be challenging, instead serving to choose a more creative path, but if that were true people would play in creative mode all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The \"fun zone\".  Doom developers have long talked about the so called \"fun zone\", where the game almost has to force the player into having fun otherwise they will work out the way to do everything the fastest and most efficiently, despite this not being where the most fun is to be had.  This leads to my next point as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "4. A steady decline in the necessity of creativity as a result fo the addition of new content.  Creativity is bred out of limitiation.  When not given enough tools to do something, you as the creator must think of ways to overcome these challenges through making compromises.  One key thing that comes into mind is furniture in minecraft.  People have long wanted furniture, however aside from a bed there is no other furniture.  The solution?  Creativity.  These stairs look something like chairs, let's use those.  I can add to that illusion through putting signs on the side to look like arm rests.  By simply adding those things into the game, it throttles creativity.\n",
      "It's a hard thing to admit. It doesn't bother me that she banged a bunch of guys before me, or had an affair in her previous marriage, or even that she's sleeping around on me now. I can accept all of that. WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF is that with me, her actual husband, she is ms. prim and proper.\n",

King tends to over-explain a lot, it's cool that we got a bit more backstory for Jack and his family but I preferred the ambiguity as to whether the hotel was supernatural or not, it added to the story's creepiness.

To top it all off, the Romans murdered Jesus and, instead of being vilified by Christian civilization, the blame was passed on to the Jews while the Romans were roleplayed and circlejerked by every petty European tinpot with an inferiority complex from the middle ages to 1945.\n",

However, the thing I hate the MOST is when most of their power comes from items. Like they get a special epic-tier sword and are suddenly powerful, but they aren't actually powerful. They're just a weakling with a fancy toy, take it away and they are useless. This is another reason i hate stories about pure mages, as they are just weak scholars when they run out of mana.\n",

      "I will say that I can like summoner stories, but only IF the MC is ACTUALLY POWERFUL BY HIMSELF. Also, only as long as he actually fights. One of my favorite stories of all time is about a super powerful necromancer, but I like that story because the main character is actually super powerful by himself and doesn't just hide behind his army of undead. Summons and items are all just borrowed power. Another example that will probably get me hate is deathnote.\n",

He still dies because he's still, at his core, a weak, normal human being.\n",

I mean, i don't mind it occasionally if you're having a big event (10 year wedding anniversary, 30th birthday, someone moving country etc...) to go to a restaurant because you want to experience the fun and not have anybody burdened with doing all the cooking and cleaning for everyone, so going out for a meal makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whenever i say that me and my partner probably go out to a restaurant maybe 5 times a year, if that... Everyone has a shocked face, like we're crazy for not wanting to spent a silly amount of money to eat food at an establishment when we could be in the comfort of our own home, literally cook ANYTHING we want, for 3x cheaper and not get that anxiety where you're being watched while eating.\n",

It's true, you can see if they're trying to work out if we're a couple or if we're just friends. Its unsettling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But yes. i much prefer eating at home then going out to a restaurant. Its cheaper, its more relaxing, i can eat in my underwear if i wanted too and not care how messy im being, and once its all done, i can literally just do whatever i want. No waiting for the bill or having to spend that extra £50 on 3 additional drinks after or be pressured into buying a desert.\n",

So many plastic surgeons are heartless in this regard and low key disgusting.\n",

      "And on another note, next time a new cartoon for adults comes out with “that” art design, before you bitch and moan about how it looks “ugly”, just think about all the hours of hard work the animators have put into these projects. Animators/storyboard artists/character designers are people too. Think about that.\n",

      "News media should only be allowed to report objective fact, no opinions. Like if you're on the news and you say an opinion, that's jail for like 1-5 years. I'm talking newspapers, institutional news and shit. Obviously there is no such thing as objective truth when it comes to mass media, they still have control over what they show us in the first place and all that., and that's okay, media is inherently manipulative, it is what it is. But theres a very clear line between necessary bias and playing the crowd. So I declare that from here on out, no opinions are allowed, no talking heads, no experts weighing in none of that subjective nonsense. Just a good faith description of events. Would it be boring? Yes. But the news should be boring. Hell why not just nationalize the. NEws and hold a raffle every day for who gets to read the script outloud on the tv. God I would be such a good president\n",
      "After Michael Scott was removed from the Office US the show improved. It opened up the writing for characters like Robert California and Nellie who could take things past simple cringe humor. Michael Scott was so obnoxious that all of the \"straight\" characters used to foil him had to have somewhat vanilla reactions. There wasn't much difference between David Wallace or any of the other outraged onlookers as they witnessed Michael Scott's shenanigans. I think the absolute prime of the show is when Dwight is leading a team in Tallahasee Florida to work on the triangle smart phone.\n",
