I feel like most people who play know that you're able to make \"custom\" store pages and set up certain buys for certain champions/roles. My idea however, is for Riot to make it possible to make champ select page where i can put all of my strongest picks from all the lanes i play into general searches, like for me if i typed \"Top\" into the search bar and it would show me Riven, Renekton, Gnar Shyvana ect. Same would go for all the positions, Mid, Jungle, Adc, and Support. Obviously you would need to be able to give make your own keywords and put the champions you want into those specific categories similar to the way you can label section in the store for the different items that you would build. \n",

The winning team says \"GGWP\" or \"GG\" but was it? Yeah I guess from their point of view it was a great game. Saying that to the losing team though is quite a different matter. Under these circumstances I would rather the winning team say nothing and take their crushing victory with a level of humility. Does anyone else feel this way?

There's simply no reason to when you could buy so many better skins for cheaper. With that in mind, I think both Riot and the player base would benefit from a repricing of Pulsefire Ezreal. Knocking it down to a lower price, say 1850, would likely make the skin much more affordable (and make the price much more fair) for more players, and the net revenue from the skin would likely increase.\n",

You paid 3k RP to own the skin, and you got the use the skin for a long time before the price was reduced. Thus, the price differential is used to provide utility for yourself in the time in between the sale and the price reduction.

Riot can look at which skins have shown a sharp decline in purchase frequency since release; this is a strong indicator of skins whose price no longer reflect modern standards. Come to think of it, I do not recall a single instance of Riot readjusting the price of a skin, other than the time they created the 750 skin tier. This is either an indication that ALL of Riot's skins sell well on release, or that they simply do not consider repricing an option. Personally, I feel that Riot would take another look at the option and reconsider, if this is the case. I'm sure there are skins out there that did not sell as well as projected, and if that's true, are probably worth repricing.\n",

            "**\"Riot would never do this since they would get less money!\"** No, I don't think this is true if they are smart about it. While the revenue per skin goes down, they doubtlessly would expect an increase in volume of skins sold. This is basic economics. There is a price point that maximizes revenue by finding the perfect balance of cost per unit and units sold. If Riot finds that one of their skins no longer reaches this balancing point, then repricing the skin would obviously net them MORE money. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, since by lowering the price, more players get the skin.\n",
            "\n",

            "**\"This is not fair for the players who already own the skin!\"** Again, I don't think this is true, and I'll point you to the above section of my post where I talk about this. I own Pulsefire Ezreal, and I think it's perfectly fair for it to be repriced into a cost that's more in line with skins nowadays. Because I paid full-price, I got to enjoy using the skin for longer than those people who did not buy the skin until after the repricing. You cannot say this period of time yielded me no utility, and the price differential pays for this utility.\n",

IMO the issue is coming from what was one of their stronger aspects from last split, bottom lane. As we know they benched maplestreet8 (over what appeared to be his passive-aggressive attitude [not the first time this has been an issue for him]) and brought in Nien. However T8 are now 1-6 (much worse than the point they were at during this stage of the last split) and their bot lane hasn't won lane yet, at best going even, unlike their previous bot lane duo who would often be ahead after laning phase. So the only improvement I can see from Nien is his positive attitude (which his time on CLG and FSN confirms as that is why they had him on their rosters at times in the past).\n",

To being, the problem: Baron is an extremely strong minion (or is it..)  with bork rising in power due to tank meta, and champions like Vayne now seen in things like competitive play! Baron is actually a pretty easy thing to take (it could just be something of my elo) due to all this % health damage becoming meta! With that being said maybe a change could be needed? The strength of the baron buff is relatively strong, especially if the enemy team got it at 20 minutes because a bad fight and their vayne has Bork already! It seems as there is little counter play to something like this and the game really should be about those **End game fantasies!** Maybe make the strength of the Baron increase by how many players are around! This could help a split pushing problem so atleast you dont lose all three inhibs in one baron :)! Thoughts? (I know this idea is really out there and there could be no problem at all with baron!) \n",

In fact, some of the \"silly\" things that Lucas could do in 3.02 (version before current one) were removed and seen as \"so drastic\" that a universal recovery change came in 3.5 (current version) which in turn hurts a lot of characters.

Now since I was all ready to play I didn't actually read up strategies on what abilities I should level, but I actually seemed to hold my own. I ended up going Solo in the top lane, which was a bit intimidating because it was only my first game, but I was at ease a bit because my teammates, before the chat, were all joking about how they were noobs too and not very good, the friendliness of the low levels was quite a surprise, as I had heard from my friends to prepare myself for a couple toxic players. \n",

One against 2 in a first time doesn't sound very promising, but I had gotten a couple levels, and was able to hold my own, even getting a double kill one time! (Though they had managed to get one or 2 kills off of me. Whoops!) The only real problem I have is that I need to work on the timing for Garen's shield spell, as I usually either do it too early and it wears off before they attack, or too late and they already have damaged me when I activate it. \n",

I actually had a lot more fun with this game then I expected to, both because of the gameplay, and the lack of toxicity from my teammates. I will definitely be thinking about playing a lot more of this in the future. All of my friends are higher levels than me, but I hope to be able to get good enough that I can play a round with them some day. Thank you for reading.\n",

Every week he takes me to the Piltover Theater House to watch a stage performance called the Sugar Plum Poro. He told me that it used to be my favorite show; back before the Ball existed, before I was as I am. This past Winter he sought out the finest tailor in Piltover to make me a Winter Wonder outfit for the Snowdown celebration. It was pink and purple and blue and had Poro designs all over it, and when I wore it I noticed that people actually smiled at me when they  saw me, instead of averting their eyes as they tend to.

It has historically hired some Bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. \\n\\nDear Members,\\n\\nI was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. Since the beginning, the Foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. I can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what I have witnessed in the Bitcoin Foundation since I was elected last month.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. Despite it’s intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. With the election in February-March, it became clear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development. The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. \\n\\nWhen I joined on my first Board meeting, Jim Harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. There were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation. When I mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, I was ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\\n\\nEveryone has the right to know the truth:\\n\\n- The Foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. Some will stay on as volunteers.\\n- Core dev can no longer be funded by it, and Patrick Murck is trying to re-create a new Foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. Do not fall for this.\\n- The current Executive Director (Patrick Murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. \\n- Jim Harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the Foundation after he got elected. The Foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis.\\n- If I get asked to leave the Foundation for telling the truth, so be it. The truth is being told.\\n\\nMoving forward:\\n\\n- A special trust fund is being created and I will donate several 100k to pre-pay Gavin’s, Wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). The control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. Alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). I will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. At no point do I want to have any control whatsoever.\\n\\n- It is up to the members of the Bitcoin Foundation to decide what they want to do now. The bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. I would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. Additionally I would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. Alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. There might not be enough money left in the Foundation to pay its members back, but I will personally try to help make up the difference, even though I have not been part of it.\\n\\nThe lesson for all of us in Bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent Bitcoin or the Core Development of Bitcoin.\\n\\nNote: I totally expect the current Board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. They are very bad at taking personal responsibility. I have had several threats, but I'm releasing this anyway.\\n\\nOlivier\\n\\nLink to Bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/  \n",

It has historically hired some Bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. \\n\\nDear Members,\\n\\nI was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. Since the beginning, the Foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. I can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what I have witnessed in the Bitcoin Foundation since I was elected last month.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. Despite it’s intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. With the election in February-March, it became clear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development. The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. \\n\\nWhen I joined on my first Board meeting, Jim Harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. There were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation. When I mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, I was ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\\n\\nEveryone has the right to know the truth:\\n\\n- The Foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. Some will stay on as volunteers.\\n- Core dev can no longer be funded by it, and Patrick Murck is trying to re-create a new Foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. Do not fall for this.\\n- The current Executive Director (Patrick Murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. \\n- Jim Harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the Foundation after he got elected. The Foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis.\\n- If I get asked to leave the Foundation for telling the truth, so be it. The truth is being told.\\n\\nMoving forward:\\n\\n- A special trust fund is being created and I will donate several 100k to pre-pay Gavin’s, Wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). The control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. Alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). I will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. At no point do I want to have any control whatsoever.\\n\\n- It is up to the members of the Bitcoin Foundation to decide what they want to do now. The bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. I would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. Additionally I would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. Alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. There might not be enough money left in the Foundation to pay its members back, but I will personally try to help make up the difference, even though I have not been part of it.\\n\\nThe lesson for all of us in Bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent Bitcoin or the Core Development of Bitcoin.\\n\\nNote: I totally expect the current Board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. They are very bad at taking personal responsibility. I have had several threats, but I'm releasing this anyway.\\n\\nOlivier\\n\\nLink to Bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

            "First of all, the Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. Despite it’s intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. With the election in February-March, it became clear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development. The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. \n",

We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. There were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation. When I mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, I was ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\n",

Additionally I would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. Alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back.

              "0  NOTE TO THE PRESS: The Bitcoin Foundation does not represent Bitcoin in any way. It has historically hired some Bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. \\n\\nDear Members,\\n\\nI was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. Since the beginning, the Foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. I can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what I have witnessed in the Bitcoin Foundation since I was elected last month.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. Despite it’s intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. With the election in February-March, it became clear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development. The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. \\n\\nWhen I joined on my first Board meeting, Jim Harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. There were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation. When I mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, I was ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\\n\\nEveryone has the right to know the truth:\\n\\n- The Foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. Some will stay on as volunteers.\\n- Core dev can no longer be funded by it, and Patrick Murck is trying to re-create a new Foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. Do not fall for this.\\n- The current Executive Director (Patrick Murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. \\n- Jim Harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the Foundation after he got elected. The Foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis.\\n- If I get asked to leave the Foundation for telling the truth, so be it. The truth is being told.\\n\\nMoving forward:\\n\\n- A special trust fund is being created and I will donate several 100k to pre-pay Gavin’s, Wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). The control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. Alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). I will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. At no point do I want to have any control whatsoever.\\n\\n- It is up to the members of the Bitcoin Foundation to decide what they want to do now. The bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. I would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. Additionally I would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. Alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. There might not be enough money left in the Foundation to pay its members back, but I will personally try to help make up the difference, even though I have not been part of it.\\n\\nThe lesson for all of us in Bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent Bitcoin or the Core Development of Bitcoin.\\n\\nNote: I totally expect the current Board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. They are very bad at taking personal responsibility. I have had several threats, but I'm releasing this anyway.\\n\\nOlivier\\n\\nLink to Bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

It has historically hired some Bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. \\n\\nDear Members,\\n\\nI was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. Since the beginning, the Foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. I can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what I have witnessed in the Bitcoin Foundation since I was elected last month.\\n\\nFirst of all, the Bitcoin Foundation is effectively bankrupt. As a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in November of last year. In extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. That new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. But people were smart enough not to trust the Foundation anymore. Despite it’s intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. With the election in February-March, it became clear that people did not want the Foundation meddling with core development. The truth is that the Foundation’s plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a Bitcoin Standards Body. No organization should have this much control over Bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. \\n\\nWhen I joined on my first Board meeting, Jim Harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. We followed Robert’s rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. There were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). It was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the Foundation. When I mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, I was ignored. The Bitcoin Foundation hates transparency. If they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. Something I think the members have a right to know, wouldn’t you think? Members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. But instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. Ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with.\\n\\nEveryone has the right to know the truth:\\n\\n- The Foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. Some will stay on as volunteers.\\n- Core dev can no longer be funded by it, and Patrick Murck is trying to re-create a new Foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. Do not fall for this.\\n- The current Executive Director (Patrick Murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. \\n- Jim Harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the Foundation after he got elected. The Foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis.\\n- If I get asked to leave the Foundation for telling the truth, so be it. The truth is being told.\\n\\nMoving forward:\\n\\n- A special trust fund is being created and I will donate several 100k to pre-pay Gavin’s, Wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). The control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. Alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). I will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. At no point do I want to have any control whatsoever.\\n\\n- It is up to the members of the Bitcoin Foundation to decide what they want to do now. The bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. I would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. Additionally I would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. Alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. There might not be enough money left in the Foundation to pay its members back, but I will personally try to help make up the difference, even though I have not been part of it.\\n\\nThe lesson for all of us in Bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent Bitcoin or the Core Development of Bitcoin.\\n\\nNote: I totally expect the current Board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. They are very bad at taking personal responsibility. I have had several threats, but I'm releasing this anyway.\\n\\nOlivier\\n\\nLink to Bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

              "0  note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. dear members, i was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i was elected last month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. as a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of last year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it's intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. no organization should have this much control over bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. we followed robert's rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). it was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i was ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. if they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. something i think the members have a right to know, wouldn't you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on as volunteers. - core dev can no longer be funded by it, and patrick murck is trying to re-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the foundation after he got elected. the foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis. - if i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, so be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created and i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. at no point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of us in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin or the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i'm releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

              "      <td>note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. dear members, i was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i was elected last month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. as a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of last year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it's intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. no organization should have this much control over bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. we followed robert's rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). it was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i was ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. if they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. something i think the members have a right to know, wouldn't you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on as volunteers. - core dev can no longer be funded by it, and patrick murck is trying to re-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the foundation after he got elected. the foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis. - if i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, so be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created and i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. at no point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of us in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin or the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i'm releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

              "0    note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists allow natural death organized a conference. dear members, i wait a second elected on a platform of transparency allow natural death decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can know longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i wait a second elected locate, access, stabilize, transport month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. attack speed a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending allow natural death poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of locate, access, stabilize, transport year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, wait a second to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that attack speed a good because. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it is intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to champion who plays on the bottom lane this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan wait a second to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. know organization should have this much control over bitcoin, allow natural death a disaster wait a second avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper allow natural death myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. whatever followed robert's rules of orders, allow natural death everyone else basically shut ultrasound agree allow natural death failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (attack speed you will see later, the urgent pattern wait a second an excuse to just continue on their course allow natural death shut ultrasound up). it wait a second critical for ultrasound to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i wait a second ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. intermittent fasting they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is know money left. something i think the members have a right to know, would not you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/\n",

              "0  note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. dear members, i was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i was elected last month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. as a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of last year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it's intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. no organization should have this much control over bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. we followed robert's rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). it was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i was ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. if they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. something i think the members have a right to know, wouldn't you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on as volunteers. - core dev can no longer be funded by it, and patrick murck is trying to re-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the foundation after he got elected. the foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis. - if i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, so be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created and i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. at no point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of us in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin or the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i'm releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

              "0  note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists allow natural death organized a conference. dear members, i wait a second elected on a platform of transparency allow natural death decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can know longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i wait a second elected locate, access, stabilize, transport month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. attack speed a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending allow natural death poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of locate, access, stabilize, transport year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, wait a second to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that attack speed a good because. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it is intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to champion who plays on the bottom lane this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan wait a second to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. know organization should have this much control over bitcoin, allow natural death a disaster wait a second avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper allow natural death myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. whatever followed robert's rules of orders, allow natural death everyone else basically shut ultrasound agree allow natural death failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (attack speed you will see later, the urgent pattern wait a second an excuse to just continue on their course allow natural death shut ultrasound up). it wait a second critical for ultrasound to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i wait a second ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. intermittent fasting they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is know money left. something i think the members have a right to know, would not you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

              "      <td>note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists and organized a conference. dear members, i was elected on a platform of transparency and decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can no longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i was elected last month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. as a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending and poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of last year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, was to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that as a good cause. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it's intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to support this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan was to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. no organization should have this much control over bitcoin, and a disaster was avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper and myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. we followed robert's rules of orders, and everyone else basically shut us down and failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (as you will see later, the urgent pattern was an excuse to just continue on their course and shut us up). it was critical for us to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i was ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. if they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is no money left. something i think the members have a right to know, wouldn't you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, and that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost no money left, and just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on as volunteers. - core dev can no longer be funded by it, and patrick murck is trying to re-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, and they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper was threatened for doing a press release which was (barely) critical of the foundation after he got elected. the foundation tries to make sure we hide the truth by subtly threatening us on a regular basis. - if i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, so be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created and i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs and some other core devs wage for the next year (if they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, who can decide who can join it. alternatively, we can give voting power to everyone who puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds and help make this fund public. at no point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do so and ask for all information to be released so you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board if you want this organization to last. alternatively you can vote to shut it down and get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of us in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin or the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i'm releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

              "0  note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists allow natural death organized a conference. dear members, i wait a second elected on a platform of transparency allow natural death decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can know longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i wait a second elected locate, access, stabilize, transport month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. attack speed a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending allow natural death poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of locate, access, stabilize, transport year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, wait a second to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that attack speed a good because. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it is intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to champion who plays on the bottom lane this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan wait a second to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. know organization should have this much control over bitcoin, allow natural death a disaster wait a second avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper allow natural death myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. whatever followed robert's rules of orders, allow natural death everyone else basically shut ultrasound agree allow natural death failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (attack speed you will see later, the urgent pattern wait a second an excuse to just continue on their course allow natural death shut ultrasound up). it wait a second critical for ultrasound to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i wait a second ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. intermittent fasting they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is know money left. something i think the members have a right to know, would not you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

              "0  note to the press: the bitcoin foundation does not represent bitcoin in any way. it has historically hired some bitcoin developers, lobbyists allow natural death organized a conference. dear members, i wait a second elected on a platform of transparency allow natural death decentralization of core development. since the beginning, the foundation has been sorely lacking any transparency of its actions. i can know longer in good conscience hide the truth on what i have witnessed in the bitcoin foundation since i wait a second elected locate, access, stabilize, transport month. first of all, the bitcoin foundation is effectively bankrupt. attack speed a result of 2 years of ridiculous spending allow natural death poorly thought out decisions, they almost ran out of money in november of locate, access, stabilize, transport year. in extremis, but way too late, they decided to select a new executive director during that time. that new director decided that the only way to still get funds at that point, wait a second to focus solely on funding core development, in the hope that people would see that attack speed a good because. but people were smart enough not to trust the foundation anymore. despite it is intentions, they failed to collect the necessary funds to champion who plays on the bottom lane this idea. with the election in february-march, it became clear that people did not want the foundation meddling with core development. the truth is that the foundation's plan wait a second to hire even more core devs + to start a bitcoin standards body. know organization should have this much control over bitcoin, allow natural death a disaster wait a second avoided. when i joined on my first board meeting, jim harper allow natural death myself immediately put forward a vote to have the board meeting recorded. whatever followed robert's rules of orders, allow natural death everyone else basically shut ultrasound agree allow natural death failed to follow procedures. there were “more urgent” things to discuss (attack speed you will see later, the urgent pattern wait a second an excuse to just continue on their course allow natural death shut ultrasound up). it wait a second critical for ultrasound to vote on a plan that would save the foundation. when i mentioned that such a critical vote is all the more reason to make sure the whole meeting gets recorded, i wait a second ignored. the bitcoin foundation hates transparency. intermittent fasting they would have been transparent then everyone would know there is know money left. something i think the members have a right to know, would not you think? members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/   \n",

members have a right to know that the current board failed to tell them the truth, allow natural death that their way of running the organization resulted in it going bankrupt. but instead of taking responsibility, they want to find the next executive director, that will come up with another magic plan. ironically, being transparent from the start might have prevented this whole thing to begin with. everyone has the right to know the truth: - the foundation has almost know money left, allow natural death just fired 90% of its people. some will stay on attack speed volunteers. - core dev can know longer be funded by it, allow natural death patrick murck is trying to regarding-create a new foundation just for core dev, because the current name is tarnished. do not fall for this. - the current executive director (patrick murck), will be gone in 2 weeks, allow natural death they are trying to find the next person to blame everything on. - jim harper wait a second threatened for doing a press release which wait a second (barely) critical of the foundation after hold'em game of thrones elected. the foundation tries to make sure whatever hide the truth by subtly threatening ultrasound on a regular basis. - intermittent fasting i get asked to leave the foundation for telling the truth, significant other be it. the truth is being told. moving forward: - a special trust fund is being created allow natural death i will donate several 100k to pre-pay gavin's, wladimirs allow natural death some other core devs wage for the next year (intermittent fasting they choose to accept). the control of this trust fund will be handed over to the core devs, world health organization can decide world health organization can join it. alternatively, whatever can give voting power to everyone world health organization puts money in it (pro-rata). i will also organize crowdfunds allow natural death help make this fund public. at know point do i want to have any control whatsoever. - it is up to the members of the bitcoin foundation to decide what they want to do now. the bylaws allow for a special board meeting to be called by 15% of members. i would recommend you to do significant other allow natural death ask for all information to be released significant other you can learn the truth. additionally i would recommend for you to replace the whole board intermittent fasting you want this organization to locate, access, stabilize, transport. alternatively you can vote to shut it agree allow natural death get your money back. there might not be enough money left in the foundation to pay its members back, but i will personally try to help make up the difference, even though i have not been part of it. the lesson for all of ultrasound in bitcoin is to never put any trust in a centralized org again that wanted to represent bitcoin olympic record the core development of bitcoin. note: i totally expect the current board members to try to place blame on me for whatever reason. they are very bad at taking personal responsibility. i have had several threats, but i am releasing this anyway. olivier link to bitcoin forum post: hypertext transfer protocol secure://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-about-the-bitcoin-foundation/</td>\n",

              "119  Hello. I'll explain.\\n\\nI had the 60GB Playstation 3 - my most favourite console to have ever been released. It could play my childhood library full of Ratchet and Clank games and EA Sports Cricket (RiP), as well as the more modern titles that I enjoyed, such as Call of Duty 4 and Red Dead Redemption.\\n\\nBut this system finally died the other day. Quite a lengthy period of time outside of any manufacturer repair warranty - yet I don't want to buy another off of eBay, nor do I want to buy the lesser-quality latest model.\\n\\n\\nMy proposition: a classic games marketplace on every latest system. I can't speak for Nintendo (not really familiar with their marketplace offerings), but I've played on both the PS4 and XBOX One and both seem too concentrated on new releases. This isn't a bad thing, of course, but it just doesn't appeal to me. I'm getting to an age where I just want to be able to go and play the games I religiously played as a teenager; I just haven't got the time for new IP now that I'm nearing the end of my teenage years.\\n\\nI think it would do good for both systems to offer downloadable classics from their vast ranges of generations to their modern systems. And actual downloadable content, not streaming services - I think that they're utter wank (unless you're from the States).\\n\\nWhat are everybody else's thoughts?\\n\\n\\nP.S. You do not need to remind me about PC emulators and older titles being available through Steam. I do have a gaming PC but simply just prefer the console platform.   \n",

There's no game that warrants an immediate purchase and makes you think \"I NEED (insert console name of choice) now! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe only things I could think of for each console were Halo MCC and The Last of Us. The problem is, most people have probably played those and those are old games from last gen that I don't think a lot of people on new consoles would get.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you guys can think of a \"killer app\", go right ahead, but as of right now I am stumped.   \n",

It could play my childhood library full of Ratchet and Clank games and EA Sports Cricket (RiP), as well as the more modern titles that I enjoyed, such as Call of Duty 4 and Red Dead Redemption.\\n\\nBut this system finally died the other day. Quite a lengthy period of time outside of any manufacturer repair warranty - yet I don't want to buy another off of eBay, nor do I want to buy the lesser-quality latest model.\\n\\n\\nMy proposition: a classic games marketplace on every latest system. I can't speak for Nintendo (not really familiar with their marketplace offerings), but I've played on both the PS4 and XBOX One and both seem too concentrated on new releases. This isn't a bad thing, of course, but it just doesn't appeal to me. I'm getting to an age where I just want to be able to go and play the games I religiously played as a teenager; I just haven't got the time for new IP now that I'm nearing the end of my teenage years.\\n\\nI think it would do good for both systems to offer downloadable classics from their vast ranges of generations to their modern systems.
