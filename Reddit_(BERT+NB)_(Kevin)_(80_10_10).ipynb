I feel like most people who play know that you're able to make \"custom\" store pages and set up certain buys for certain champions/roles. My idea however, is for Riot to make it possible to make champ select page where i can put all of my strongest picks from all the lanes i play into general searches, like for me if i typed \"Top\" into the search bar and it would show me Riven, Renekton, Gnar Shyvana ect. Same would go for all the positions, Mid, Jungle, Adc, and Support. Obviously you would need to be able to give make your own keywords and put the champions you want into those specific categories similar to the way you can label section in the store for the different items that you would build. \n",

The winning team says \"GGWP\" or \"GG\" but was it? Yeah I guess from their point of view it was a great game. Saying that to the losing team though is quite a different matter. Under these circumstances I would rather the winning team say nothing and take their crushing victory with a level of humility. Does anyone else feel this way?

There's simply no reason to when you could buy so many better skins for cheaper. With that in mind, I think both Riot and the player base would benefit from a repricing of Pulsefire Ezreal. Knocking it down to a lower price, say 1850, would likely make the skin much more affordable (and make the price much more fair) for more players, and the net revenue from the skin would likely increase.\n",

You paid 3k RP to own the skin, and you got the use the skin for a long time before the price was reduced. Thus, the price differential is used to provide utility for yourself in the time in between the sale and the price reduction.

Riot can look at which skins have shown a sharp decline in purchase frequency since release; this is a strong indicator of skins whose price no longer reflect modern standards. Come to think of it, I do not recall a single instance of Riot readjusting the price of a skin, other than the time they created the 750 skin tier. This is either an indication that ALL of Riot's skins sell well on release, or that they simply do not consider repricing an option. Personally, I feel that Riot would take another look at the option and reconsider, if this is the case. I'm sure there are skins out there that did not sell as well as projected, and if that's true, are probably worth repricing.\n",

            "\n",
            "**\"Riot would never do this since they would get less money!\"** No, I don't think this is true if they are smart about it. While the revenue per skin goes down, they doubtlessly would expect an increase in volume of skins sold. This is basic economics. There is a price point that maximizes revenue by finding the perfect balance of cost per unit and units sold. If Riot finds that one of their skins no longer reaches this balancing point, then repricing the skin would obviously net them MORE money. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, since by lowering the price, more players get the skin.\n",
            "\n",

            "**\"This is not fair for the players who already own the skin!\"** Again, I don't think this is true, and I'll point you to the above section of my post where I talk about this. I own Pulsefire Ezreal, and I think it's perfectly fair for it to be repriced into a cost that's more in line with skins nowadays. Because I paid full-price, I got to enjoy using the skin for longer than those people who did not buy the skin until after the repricing. You cannot say this period of time yielded me no utility, and the price differential pays for this utility.\n",

IMO the issue is coming from what was one of their stronger aspects from last split, bottom lane. As we know they benched maplestreet8 (over what appeared to be his passive-aggressive attitude [not the first time this has been an issue for him]) and brought in Nien. However T8 are now 1-6 (much worse than the point they were at during this stage of the last split) and their bot lane hasn't won lane yet, at best going even, unlike their previous bot lane duo who would often be ahead after laning phase. So the only improvement I can see from Nien is his positive attitude (which his time on CLG and FSN confirms as that is why they had him on their rosters at times in the past).\n",

To being, the problem: Baron is an extremely strong minion (or is it..)  with bork rising in power due to tank meta, and champions like Vayne now seen in things like competitive play! Baron is actually a pretty easy thing to take (it could just be something of my elo) due to all this % health damage becoming meta! With that being said maybe a change could be needed? The strength of the baron buff is relatively strong, especially if the enemy team got it at 20 minutes because a bad fight and their vayne has Bork already! It seems as there is little counter play to something like this and the game really should be about those **End game fantasies!** Maybe make the strength of the Baron increase by how many players are around! This could help a split pushing problem so atleast you dont lose all three inhibs in one baron :)! Thoughts? (I know this idea is really out there and there could be no problem at all with baron!) \n",

In fact, some of the \"silly\" things that Lucas could do in 3.02 (version before current one) were removed and seen as \"so drastic\" that a universal recovery change came in 3.5 (current version) which in turn hurts a lot of characters.

Now since I was all ready to play I didn't actually read up strategies on what abilities I should level, but I actually seemed to hold my own. I ended up going Solo in the top lane, which was a bit intimidating because it was only my first game, but I was at ease a bit because my teammates, before the chat, were all joking about how they were noobs too and not very good, the friendliness of the low levels was quite a surprise, as I had heard from my friends to prepare myself for a couple toxic players. \n",

One against 2 in a first time doesn't sound very promising, but I had gotten a couple levels, and was able to hold my own, even getting a double kill one time! (Though they had managed to get one or 2 kills off of me. Whoops!) The only real problem I have is that I need to work on the timing for Garen's shield spell, as I usually either do it too early and it wears off before they attack, or too late and they already have damaged me when I activate it. \n",

I actually had a lot more fun with this game then I expected to, both because of the gameplay, and the lack of toxicity from my teammates. I will definitely be thinking about playing a lot more of this in the future. All of my friends are higher levels than me, but I hope to be able to get good enough that I can play a round with them some day. Thank you for reading.\n",

Every week he takes me to the Piltover Theater House to watch a stage performance called the Sugar Plum Poro. He told me that it used to be my favorite show; back before the Ball existed, before I was as I am. This past Winter he sought out the finest tailor in Piltover to make me a Winter Wonder outfit for the Snowdown celebration. It was pink and purple and blue and had Poro designs all over it, and when I wore it I noticed that people actually smiled at me when they  saw me, instead of averting their eyes as they tend to.
