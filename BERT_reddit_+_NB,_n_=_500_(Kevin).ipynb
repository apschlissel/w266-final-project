I woke up and saw a mystical waifu in front of me, and finally thought I was about to get some bitches, but instead she called me a pervert and it turned out I was just staring at some random girl's boobs. Defeated, I slowly walked home when I got hit in the leg by a bullet, I cried so hard I shitted myself, when I turned to look at the person who shot me, it was my brother. First, he called me a weeb, then I got no bitches, and now he shot me. I was so incomprehensibly pissed off that I pulled the bullet out with my own hands and threw it at my brother's ankle. Somehow, my strength had increased within that single moment, and the bullet shot through. As my brother writhed in pain, I smiled, the shit in my pants and dried up tears plus the blood leaking from my leg made me smell horrible, but I smiled, smirking at him I laughed “Why should I bare hatred towards someone who’s obviously weaker than myself? I only pity them.” I walked away, looking super badass, I'm pretty sure all these girls were fainting because of how sexy I look, then again it could have been because of the shit in my pants. As I walked forward, I got hit by a car and a bird shat on my face as I blacked out.\n",

            "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

            " When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",
            "Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston, sauntering round with no rump. Every guy here'd love to plow you Gaston, even without your backlumps.There's no gal around here as big titted as you, you were everyone's favorite chick. Everyone was hot for and turned on by you, and it's not so hard to see why. (Unlike every guy's dick) No one's flat like Gaston, with tits fat like Gaston, no one's hips are just totally gone like Gaston's, for there's no chick on Earth half as manly, formerly perfect turned abomination. You can ask any coomer's dick or handy, and they'll tell you which one they'd prefer to jizz on. No one's been like Gaston, a she-man like Gaston. No one's a triangle quite like Gaston. As a specimen yes I'm meant just for self mating! My what a gal that Gaston. Give 5 times the cheeks and 12 times the lips. Gaston is all breast now without any hips. No one sucks like Gaston, no one fucks like gaston. In a virtue match no one signals like Gaston. For there's no one as surly and brawny. As you see I've got biceps to spare! Not a bit of her's scraggly or scrawny. Not right! I'm all stick below waist with no derriere! No one mates like gaston, no one baits like Gaston. In a slurping match no one glurps like Gaston. I was especially good for masturbating! Ten points for gaston. When I was a lass I drank 4 dozen loads for my ass to be big and in charge, now that it's gone I down 5 dozen loads to try and return it to laaaarge! No one shrinks like gaston, hornily drinks like Gaston Then goes riding around eating pinks like Gaston. I use denim in all my decorating!My what a gal that Gaston!\n",

            "After several days spent playing Epic’s action-focused, base building, horde-survival game, it's no secret why Fortnite is fun, addictive and full of jest. Which is nice and dandy, but something nobody is talking about are those big butts. The large behinds which accompany each female is pure unadulterated eye candy disguised as candy fluff. With the rise of technology, jiggle physics have been given a more prominent role in video games. Now days body physics are a must have and thankfully Epic Games are well aware of this fact. Hence the reason their female characters rear ends jiggle like jelly in an exaggerated and unnatural manner when they move. Epic Games has taken full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 and managed to produce amazing results for a game which is currently still in early access. The character models are vibrant, colourful and most importantly sexy enough to ogle. One of Fortnite's strongest points is it's 3D models and this is proven the moment you take control of your character. As Unreal Engine 4's first ever game, Fortnite has been on the forefront of technological change. Its creators have made a gleaming, emboldened, co-op shooter, and at the same time fixed the bugs and issues of a new engine so that a new group of UE developers won't have to. From the start, when Unreal Engine 4 needed a game to establish its core systems reputation, Epic looked around. And in their own office was this gaudy crafting, building, and action game called Fortnite. A game which has surpassed 7 million players in a week thanks to it's player vs player mode: Battle Royale, while a estimated 10 millions have joined the fun altogether on PlayStation, PC and Xbox One. As an ass lover, one of the main reasons why controlling a female character is visually appealing in Fortnite is because of that glorious view. Every single woman in Fortnite has a big, fat and juicy derriere to admire as they run through the colourful sandbox world and it's a beautiful sight to behold. Even the petite female heroes have something to ogle, Fornite? More like Thicc-nite. The women in Fortnite are absolutely beautiful and their big donks just add to their busty and mysterious 3D appeal. Giving each girl a delicious bottom is definitely pleasing on the eye, especially when running through the massive wasteland to gather materials and hunt zombies. Who has the best booty in Fortnite? Well it's definitely a toss up between the Constructor and Soldier class. While the Ninja and Outlanders do have a little junk in the trunk, it pales in comparison to the more superior Soldier and Constructor butts which are deliciously shaped for your viewing pleasure. Watching each female walk in tight pants as their butts jiggle is one of the more rewarding aspects of the game unrelated to gameplay. Epic Games have done a tremulous job of making the booty jiggle movements look natural in a cartoony 3D environment. Not to say they're the first to pull off this feat, but there's nothing with giving credit where it's due. What's even better than watching your female hero run? Watching them crouch walk in Fortnite's Battle Royale Mode. A move which is currently exclusive to PVP and gives players a minimal stealth approach to the cutthroat 100 player war zone. Crouching is tactical in essence but it also gives players a juicy view of their character's succulent sack. Nothing is more satisfying than ogling your character's cakes as they crouch walk in front of the camera. Well actually.. While crouching gives players a wholesome view of ass it falls short of watching your female character walk. Casually walking in Fortnite shows the full jiggle effect of your character's booty. Walking has never been more sexy in Fortnite as your hero hypnotically sways their hips in diva fashion. While the camera in Fortnite control is satisfactory, it's a pity it isn't more inviting. You can't see the front of your character and nor can you zoom in, which is a bummer. Had the camera being more accessible then we'd be able to get a closer view of those glorious behinds. Though the ultimate view of your character's ass in-game is achieved when you're on the ground literally dying as your life depletes, what does that mean? Well when you're staggering for life and crawling on the ground, it's not hard to miss your character's butt sticking out in clear view as it wiggles aimlessly. Besides jogging, this is hands down one of the best candid butt shots. So which girls in particular have the best butts in Fortnite? Well after analysing several female characters it came to a close call, but the best butt in Fortnite most certainly belongs to Special Forces Banshee. Not only is this soldier a cutie pie but she also has ass for days. Not taking everything away from Ms Ramirez, who comes in a close second. Something about watching her move as she travels through Fornite's wasteland is mouth watering and fascinating. While it's true that each class shares the same body type, there's just something about Special Forces Bansee that sticks out. Though she's not the only one with a juicy behind. Everyone has noticed Tank Penny, the female Constructor with a lot of junk in the trunk. She's thick and fans have been quick to point that out. In fact you could say she's one of the most popular characters in the game, mainly due to her thick proportions. Yet while Penny is easy on the eye, we'd give the edge to her counterpart Controller Harper. Controller Harper like Penny is thick fat, the only difference is she's black with dreadlocks. Something about Harper stands out and watching Controller run as her booty jiggles is very breathtaking. The character models in Fortnite are voluptuous and Harper is probably as juicy and thick as they'll ever get. Tank Penny is getting all the love but Controller Harper deserves just as much. Still regardless of who is your favourite girl in Fortnite there's no shortage of butt. There's a little booty for everyone and that's not a bad thing. Epic game's survivor co-op shooter is not only diverse in it's character designs, weapons and expansive world, but also it's variety of butts which comes in all shape and sizes.\n",

            "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

            "Dude…I saw Monica Bellucci live once in Venice while she was recording Mozart in the Jungle. I lost my mind. My whole family was having an awkward group boner/meltdown. Even my mom. My mom. She undressed that woman with her eyes and fanned herself like her arm malfunctioned and was flushing hard. My 4 brothers were blushing ear to ear like idiots and the little one burst himself and ran to a bathroom before my brothers followed him and gingerly came back like 5 minutes later. My dad put the brave front for all of us. He was so cool and collected and trying to not act like a dog in front me and mom. So he just took a fashion magazine I had and was alternating between fanning mom and himself. We were just walking around when my family and I happened on the set location. The sex appeal that woman has and unleashes is mind boggling. Like she’s just so free, unhinged and elegant on top of it. It was my first time in Venice. I was having so much fun but I discovered there and there that people definitely add to the magic of life. She’s so womanly and lush. As a woman, I feel not enough women fully allow to let their full natures out (for good reason) and she does (she’s got two huge body guards that look like Snorlax though). To feel so confident and safe to just be beautiful and sexy in the open is so mesmerizing. Her smile is breathtaking. In person, she’s eons prettier. Like the pictures and movies seriously don’t do her justice. Honestly if I had the luxury/money she does I’d be nothing less than what she is and embodies. Like a walking fertility god. She’s like both the woman everyone wants to be when they grow up and the woman we want to bone. If she had any bisexual inklings, man…some people aren’t worth the hype, but Signorina Bellucci is worth the hype. She was so nice and actually came to us and greeted us. We were all blushing like we were going to combust and all we could do was stare at her beautiful cleavage and eyes. My dad giggled like a little girl and my brothers did the avoidant staring guys do when they’re trying to not sexualize a woman. Her perfume was so beautiful, like spicy golden honey. The knowing smile she flashed my mom while my dad was just agape was epic. I got so mad she didn’t flash me her teeth like that. My mom’s hella straight but apparently she had second thoughts when she saw Monica and Monica caught it. Next to the word “woman” should be her picture because honestly she’s got it. The first time in my life where I sympathized with men and their blue balls as I had an inconceivable urge to have her carry my eggs and I’m a woman. So did my mom. I didn’t know how I’d manage to scramble our eggs as I was still “innocent” but then my brain did all the dirty work for me. I felt like fucking pressure cooker and I thought I was going to die from overheating. If it was possible to do her brain, I’d do that too. I want to shuck her like escargot. The weather was perfectly fine that day but it felt like that time we had a heatwave…We all still reminisce over the infamous family boner.\n",

            "I was on my way home last month when I first saw him. He was gone so quick I wasn't actually sure that I had seen anything at all. I happened to turn my head towards a dark alley just in time to catch a man-like figure dart behind an overflowing garbage bin. I thought I must have been seeing things, perhaps it was just my imagination going into overdrive after a long shift. That's what I assumed anyway, until a week later when I saw him again.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was the same alley as last time, around the same time. Only this time he didn't dart away. He just stood there staring at me. He looked fairly normal, around six foot-something, shaggy hair, very average for a middle aged man. He did look a little older than he should, like the years had not been kind to him. It didn't take me long to notice that he was missing something... his ass. A concerned look must have crossed my face because he darted behind the same garbage bin, probably in shame. I wanted to investigate, but it was almost 1am and following a strange, assless man into an alley probably wasn't such a good idea. So I just shrugged it off and kept walking. As I continued walking I'd occasionally hear a scurrying behind me, but no matter how quickly i'd turn around, there would be nothing there.\n",
            "\n",
            "When I finally got home that night I laid awake in bed thinking about the assless man and where his ass went. Did he lose a bet with a friend? Did he make a powerful enemy? Was having an ass against his religion? All these questions raced through my mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now I want to be very clear about something, when I say this man had no ass, I do not mean he was flat, I mean that his ass was visibly inverted, by like... a lot. If his ass was a belly button, it'd be an innie. It was like he had every part of his ass surgically removed, but why?\n",
            "\n",
            "The next night was the same as the last, only this time for the rest of my journey home after passing the alley it seemed like the wind was whispering to me. What was it saying? \"Assssss. My asssss.\" Needless to say I walked home a little quicker that night.  When I got inside my roommate could tell that I was visibly distraught.\n",

            "\"No,\" I sighed \"it's the damnedest thing. You know the alley on third and sixteenth? I keep seeing this man there and, well I'm going to sound crazy, but... he has no ass.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As soon as I said that she fumbled with her phone so hard it went flying across the room shattering a candle sitting on the windowsill. After staring at me wide eyed for quite some time she finally spoke.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Repeat that last part.\" She whispered, her face pale as the mans ass would have been.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"He has... no ass?\" I repeated, confused. As soon as I said that she burst into tears. I tried to console her, but nothing could get her to calm down. Eventually through sobs she began to speak.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"They... they took his ass\" she hiccupped \"so now, he's going to take yours.\" Her sobbing continued for hours. When she was finally calm enough to speak in coherent sentences she told me the full story. The story of the Assless Chap. Apparently back in the early nineties there was a man named Pip, he was an ass model. It was said that he had the fattest, juiciest badonkadonk in all of the country. He had it all, fame, fortune... an ass. Then one day everything changed. Suddenly nothing was enough for him. He got greedy. He got ass implants. Making his badonkadonk even fatter and juicier. The other ass models were already struggling as it was, but with those implants, he ruined their lives. There were no ass modeling jobs left for anyone else. Children starved. Models were evicted from their homes. Their asses seemed to deflate just as quickly as their spirits did. That's when the failed, saggy assed, former ass models got together and decided to teach him a lesson. They decided no one man deserved the power of such a fat, juicy ass. They decided they needed to take it. So they did.\n",
            "\n",
            "On June nineth 1996 they cornered him in that same alley I had seen him in the past few weeks. He begged and pleaded, but it was useless. After a very painful half an hour or so, they had done it. They removed his entire ass and then some. Then they made him watch as person by person they surgically implanted a piece of his ass into their own. It was no longer his ass, it was *their* ass. Without his ass he was nothing, his wife left him, he couldn't get a paying gig anywhere, nobody wanted to hire a man with no ass. He had no choice but to turn to the sewers, to hide in the darkness amongst the shit that he can no longer make... because he has no ass.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now it's rumored that five years later around that date the Assless Chap emerged from the sewers an returned to that same alley to find a victim with a fat, juicy badonkadonk, so he could take their ass for himself. He would turn them into the Assless Chap, leaving them to wander the sewers until a week before June nineth, where they're allowed to return to the alley and use that entire week to search for the perfect ass to steal and make their own. If you heard \"Assss. My asssss.\" in the wind that's how you know you were chosen.\n",
            "\n",
            "I convinced myself my roommate was just fucking with me. She had to be, right? Regardless, seeing as it was June nineth, I slept with my gun on my bedside table that night. It took me hours to fall asleep, but somehow I finally did. What felt like seconds after I heard my door creak open. Without hesitation I pulled out my gun and shot at the shadowy figure in my room. As the body thudded to the floor I heard a familiar voice scream out \"I was just checking to make sure you still had your ass!\" It was my roommate. She wasn't trying to steal my ass, she was trying to save my ass.\n",
            "\n",
            "I shot up and ran to her now lifeless body, leaving my gun behind. I was kneeled over her, begging for forgiveness, but she couldn't hear me. As I was bent over her I felt a sharp pain on my ass cheek, almost like a sawing, I turned around, but it was already too late. The assless chap was stealing my ass. I watched in horror as my fat juicy badonkadonk got smaller and smaller, going from a dummy thicc outie, to a sad, dried up innie. The Assless Chaps got fatter and fatter as mine got smaller and smaller. \"My asssssss. MY assssss!\" the Assless Chap hissed and he took the last of what used to be my ass before using his newly installed ass to bounce his way out of my apartment.\n",
            "\n",
            "As I lay there assless and friendless I think about all the times I took my ass for granted. My roommate I could take or leave, she couldn't hold her phone for more than two minutes without accidentally yeeting it into something, but my ass... now that I will truly miss.\n",
            "\n",
            "So let this be your warning, stay away from the alley the week of June nineth, I'm on the hunt for a fat, juicy, badonkadonk.... and it just might end up being yours.\n",
            "Last year, my husband discovered Destiny’s Child. I don’t know how he wasn’t aware of them before, but that’s beside the point. He obviously didn’t have this obsession before we were married. In fact, we have been married for 7 years, and he’d never exhibited any signs of obsessive behavior before this. Now, his obsession is taking over both of our lives and costing us a lot of money. He spends all day on eBay bidding on Destiny’s Child merch. He is always the highest bidder, so it’s very expensive. He is only subscribed to streaming services so he can listen to them. He bought a Bluetooth shower speaker so he can listen to them while he bathes. We cannot have one conversation without him saying something like, “You know, this actually reminds me of a Destiny’s Child lyric.” He’s spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning the choreography from every video. He makes me sit down and watch him dance in front of the TV to make sure his form and timing are perfect. He emails the members often, begging them for a reunion tour. He has also sent them birthday gifts in the mail. I would like to point out that his obsession is not sexual in any way— he just thinks they’re really cool. I’m almost to my wit’s end. I feel like I can’t escape Destiny’s Child and have lost my husband completely to this obsession. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n",

            "More specifically, guy says when he was about 13 he went on a fishing trip with his dad. The kid catches a fish and his dad tells him to throw it back, but he's so excited for the fish he caught he doesn't want to let it go. He chunks a rock in the water instead so his dad thinks he threw it back, then he stuffs the fish in the front of his pants to hide it. On the ride home the fish is warming up and wriggling and he's trying to ignore it by talking to his dad, but he can't help himself from the sensation and nuts in his pants all over the fish. After getting home he pulls the fish out, cleans the cum off of it and cleans himself up. Taken by that experience, he keeps the fish in the mini-fridge in his bedroom and whenever he wants to whack off, he pulls the fish out and busts all over it. He does this over and over. Regular porn no longer entices him, as the best sensation he's ever felt is a fish wriggling to death against his dick. He can't beat off without thinking about the fish, but there's no porn for that online. He says \"I'll never forget that feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\" He doesn't like fish as a food really, he prefers medium rare steak. He is eventually discovered by his dad because the smell of a fish being defrosted, covered in cum, then cleaned and refrozen starts to become prominent. He lies that it's not his fish, a friend gave it to him. His relationship with his dad is ruined.\n",

She told me she was pregnant the next day! Then she gave birth 7 months later, I always thought it took 9 months but it was probably sped up by how hot the sex was! What's worse, THE BABY WAS BURNED! It was sort of brown! The doctor held the baby and just gave us a skeptical look, I was confused and my wife seemed concerned. The baby was burned by how hot the sex was! DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID WITH MY WIFE, DO NOT HAVE HOT SEX OR THE BABY WILL BE BURNED!!!\n",

She told me that her son died of cancer or something and he was \"in a better place\". I instinctively laughed. I told her how silly it was that she believed in a magic sky fairy and that her son is not in \"cloud world\" because it doesn't exist. This idiot kept on crying this time calling me something (couldn't tell, I was distracted by how stupid she was) and I had enough of it and wrote her up. I told her if she ever came in with such nonsense again I would make sure she is fired. So yeah, I basically owned a believer today.\n",

And then I started seeing: everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked, all these fucking pricks, everywhere I looked, doing the exact same fucking thing... over and over and over and over again thinking: \"This time, it's gonna be different; no, no, no, no, no, please... This time it's gonna be different.\" ...I am sorry, I don't like the way you are looking at me... Okay, do you have a fucking problem in your head? Do you think I am bullshitting you?

            "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

            "Starting back four years ago, my mom left my dad cause he was beating her. She met this new guy on, get this, world of Warcraft. They had a good thing going and eventually arranged a meet up after finding out he lived a city over from us. Fast forward a year and he’s now over at our house everyday basically living there. He worked a clean job and made a nice wage but was super pretentious and spiteful. He began to act like he knew me and my sisters like we were his own and started demanding us around. My mom, being the non-confrontational woman she is, turned a blind eye. Day after day he would come back from work and order us to clean the house and bring him everything he needed (snacks, drinks, etc). It went on like this for some time and he kept getting worse and more demanding. \n",
            "\n",
            "My mom works a dead end job and really needed the financial support from him as well as emotional too. So she acted like he was just perfect. My sisters and I would go to her privately and complain about how he’s bossing us around and he’s not even our step dad yet. She showed sorrow and empathy and assured us she would talk to him. Nope. That miserable man only got worse. He would threaten to hit us and lock us in our mud room in the basement if we didn’t do exactly as we told him. On days that our mom wasn’t there (she frequently went on 12 hour shifts) he would take our electronics and send us upstairs. \n",
            "\n",
            "My sister tried to argue back one time and he pulled her by her hair to the laundry room. She later told my other sisters and I that he grabbed her in her private areas and groped her while yelling in her ear to never talk back again. I was infuriated. I’m a big guy but not athletic, I’m around 6’2 and pretty husky so my stepdad and I are pretty matched when it comes to size. Skill, though? No, he works a pencil pushing desk job and couldn’t connect a punch to a wall. My sister informed me of his assault and I lost it. I called my mom and told her he was beating us and to call the police. I walked downstairs and turned the corner to the dining room and saw him on his laptop. I started yelling at him with tears in my eyes not to touch my sister ever again and that he wasn’t my dad. \n",
            "\n",
            "He looked over in disbelief as I never confront him. He got up and turned red. I knew it was go time. He step toward me and said something like “you’ll never talk like that to me again you hear me” he stepped closer and tried to grab my shirt. I threw the hardest punch I’ve ever thrown and connected with his nose. He fell back a bit and looked stunned. I was also surprised at myself so I just stood their for a sec.\n",
            "\n",
            "He took that time to lunge at me and he got me to the ground. I don’t remember how many times he punched me but he beat my hands and back of my head up while I was face down blocking the back of my head. I managed to throw him off me after a bit and he hit his head off the table. He fell on the ground with his legs still on mine and started making a rough snoring sound. I was blacked out. All I remember from there is turning around and socking him in the head multiple times. After two minutes of wailing on him head to toe my two sisters ran downstairs and pulled me off him. He was a mess. His forehead was swollen and he had two black eyes. He wasn’t snoring anymore so I thought I killed him. I just sat back as my sisters called my mom and told her what was happening. The police started banging on the door and my one sister opened it. They got everyone away from his body and put me in handcuffs. Not much I remember from that point except for being in court with two witness statements from my sisters stating it was self defense. Fast forward now. I’m 17 and I still live with my mom. She was devastated with me and was contemplating putting me in a home right after it all went down. \n",
            "\n",
            "As for my stepdad. He was airlifted to the ER and died two times while in the hospital. He regained consciousness two weeks after the incident and was a new person. My mom is telling me all this because clearly I can’t see him anymore. She said he talks with a lisp now and can’t drink correctly. He has trouble moving his arms and legs and just sits in his brothers house all day in a special chair staring at nothing. He talks and apparently gets really excited when my mom visits him but isn’t the same anymore. I don’t feel bad at all. He molested my 12 year old sister and got ten fold what he did to her. My family isn’t the same anymore and it seems like every time I come out of my room my family is scared of me. \n",

            " I just became the 10th dentist today but let me paint a picture for you. (No I do not think I’m the smartest man on Reddit)  I am trying to get my GED and I’ve walked into 2 schools at this point dealing with this roundabout fucked way to get my GED. Each time the faculty had no clue where they needed to take me all I knew is I had to be at this school nothing else. When I talked they would just sit there with dumb looks on their face barely replying, I a 16 year old had to carry the conversation.  We all have to talk to people that’s a part of life but everyone I talk to just seems stupid as a brick, cashier’s I talk too, managers, the super intendant, my father.  I don’t have a lot of friends, I try to find ones that understand and are excited about things like chemistry, history, biology anything that’s not video games or TikTok.  When I’d meet new people I’d get excited thinking we’d like the same things but I’d talk to them and find out the only conversation they can carry is about war zone it used to kill me until I just assumed everyone was like that now I expect it.  Bringing me to today I had a fight with my father and it made me realize how impossibly stupid this man is. I’m not going to get into the juicy details but at one point of the fight he said “well if your so cold put on a sweater or EaT MoRe!” (The fight wasn’t purely do to temperature there was also more petty shit.) I lost 60 pounds in about 4 months of starving myself because I am not pleased with life or being trapped in this meat sack.   Then bam it hit me, why fight with this man or anyone if they can’t see how hypocritical they are being? why waste my time with that? Everyone I talk to acts stupid and makes me feel like I’m losing braincells so why deal with it.  Sadly I still have to deal with the GED people but I found 1 tolerable person and have made her my go to contact. I hope things will go better in college and maybe just maybe me and someone can talk about something other that how their K/D ratio is good but could be better if sbmm was better.  Edit: yes there are grammar mistakes will I fix them? No I acknowledge them and everyone pointing them out I applaud you. but that one 15 year old going into my post history just to find things to hurt me or that other person claiming to be an adult only to go into my history to grammar correct me I give y’all the king and queen crown.

            "## Summary\n",
            "\n",
            "* The Hog Rider is a fast ground [troop](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Army) with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy [Walls](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Walls/Home_Village). He is unlocked at level 2 [Dark Barracks](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Barracks).\n",
            "* The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.\n",
            "* His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.\n",
            "* Hog Riders prioritize [defensive structures](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Defensive_Buildings/Home_Village) above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy [buildings](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Buildings) and [troops](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Troops) while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy [Clan Castle](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Castle) troops, [heroes](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes) or [Skeleton Trap](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Trap) skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending [Grand Warden](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Warden) and the activated [Town Hall](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Town_Hall) weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.  \n",
            "Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Strategy\n",
            "\n",
            "### Offensive\n",
            "\n",
            "* He can be used to jump over any level [Walls](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Walls/Home_Village), rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other [ground troops](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Ground_Troops), you will still need to deploy [Wall Breakers](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_Breaker), a [Jump Spell](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Jump_Spell), or [Earthquake Spells](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Earthquake_Spell) in order to assist them.\n",
            "* Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a \"[Hog Rider Rush](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_Strategies:Hog_Rush_and_Support)\", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of [Dark Elixir](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Resources#Dark_Elixir), and sports weaknesses against defending [Clan Castle](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Castle) troops, [Heroes](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes), [Giant Bombs](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Bomb), and [Skeleton Traps](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Trap), a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels.\n",
            "* At [Town Hall](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Town_Hall) 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with [Miners](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Miner) in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air.\n",
            "* At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like [Giants](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Giant); they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage.\n",
            "* They work well with the [Healing Spell](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Healing_Spell) when you group several of them together.\n",
            "   * A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of [defenses](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Defensive_Buildings/Home_Village) (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, deploy them in front of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most value out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.\n",
            "   * Spots where [Giant Bombs](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Bomb) or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast.\n",
            "* The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple [Archers](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Archer) or [Wizards](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard) to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during [Clan War raids](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars). However, [Skeletons](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton) from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons.\n",
            "* Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially [Dragons](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon), can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.\n",
            "   * [Poison Spells](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Spell) can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps.\n",
            "   * Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Defensive\n",
            "\n",
            "* Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass [Walls](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Walls/Home_Village) renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as [Barbarians](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Barbarian), etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.\n",
            "   * Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered [defenses](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Defensive_Buildings/Home_Village) on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of [resources](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Buildings/Home_Village) in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses ([Inferno Towers](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Inferno_Tower), [X-Bows](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/X-Bow), etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses.\n",
            "   * You can place [Spring Traps](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Spring_Trap/Home_Village) and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.\n",
            "* Hog Riders can be easily killed using \"forced pathing\". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of [Giant Bombs](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Bomb) in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time.\n",
            "* [Clan Castle](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Castle) troops, [Heroes](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes), and [Skeleton Traps](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Trap) set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.\n",
            "   * In [Clan Wars](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Wars), [Dragons](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon) are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for [Town Halls](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Town_Hall) 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.\n",
            "* Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.\n",
            "* Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Upgrade Differences\n",
            "\n",
            "* The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n",
            "   * Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands.\n",
            "   * At level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammerhead goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammerhead.\n",
            "   * At level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 [Goblin](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin).\n",
            "   * At level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes and a bronze plating.\n",
            "   * At level 7, the edges of his hammer start to glow red, and he gains a brown headband but reverts to a black mohawk.\n",
            "   * At level 8, his hammer is now mostly golden. His hog also gains a headband.\n",
            "   * At level 9, the gold on his hammer is much thicker. His headband also lightens in color.\n",
            "   * At level 10, his hammer turns a bright light blue color that resembles the look of ice. This matches the theme of Town Hall 13. It also gains a small same-colored glow.\n",
            "   * At level 11, his hammer turns a light greenish color. This matches the theme of Town Hall 14. His hog gains gold armour on its face and muzzle.\n",

            "* You can have a maximum of 60 Hog Riders at one time in a complete set of fully upgraded [Army Camps](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Army_Camp/Home_Village). This number increases to 69 if you include the 9 that can fit into a level 9 or higher [Clan Castle](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Castle).

It says: ***“Fast melee troop that targets buildings and can jump over the river. He followed the echoing call of \"Hog Riderrrrr\" all the way through the Arena doors.”***\n",

            " The town of Willamette, with a population of 53,594, soon became crippled under the force of the undead. Bands of survivors retreated to the town's only source of entertainment; the Willamette Parkview Mall and barricaded themselves inside. Carlito himself had set up a hideout within the mall, where he monitored the survivors and kept tabs on activity outside the mall.  When news about Willamette being quarantined went public, idealistic photojournalist Frank West set off to cover the story and make a name for himself. However, when he arrived, the entrance to the mall was breached and the zombies flooded in.  Frank quickly discovered the real situation and took it upon himself to solve the case behind the outbreak with the help of DHS agents Brad Garrison and Jessie McCarney. Another source of help came in the form of Carlito's younger sister; Isabela Keyes. Isabella shared her brother's grief for the people of Santa Cabeza but was able to accept that the outbreak was an accident, and the intentions of the research conducted there were good.  After learning of the full truth, Otis stole a Military Helicopter and saved all the survivors Frank had recused by taking them to a safe area. Frank and Isabela escaped Willamette through the tunnels and spread the truth about both incidents to the public. The US government was forced to admit responsibility for Santa Cabeza, but they blamed Willamette solely on terrorists (which, in a sense, was true).\n",
            "Last year, my husband discovered Destiny’s Child. I don’t know how he wasn’t aware of them before, but that’s beside the point. He obviously didn’t have this obsession before we were married. In fact, we have been married for 7 years, and he’d never exhibited any signs of obsessive behavior before this. Now, his obsession is taking over both of our lives and costing us a lot of money. He spends all day on eBay bidding on Destiny’s Child merch. He is always the highest bidder, so it’s very expensive. He is only subscribed to streaming services so he can listen to them. He bought a Bluetooth shower speaker so he can listen to them while he bathes. We cannot have one conversation without him saying something like, “You know, this actually reminds me of a Destiny’s Child lyric.” He’s spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning the choreography from every video. He makes me sit down and watch him dance in front of the TV to make sure his form and timing are perfect. He emails the members often, begging them for a reunion tour. He has also sent them birthday gifts in the mail. I would like to point out that his obsession is not sexual in any way— he just thinks they’re really cool. I’m almost to my wit’s end. I feel like I can’t escape Destiny’s Child and have lost my husband completely to this obsession. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n",
            "Guy says when he was about 13 he went on a fishing trip with his dad. The kid catches a fish and his dad tells him to throw it back, but he's so excited for the fish he caught he doesn't want to let it go. He chunks a rock in the water instead so his dad thinks he threw it back, then he stuffs the fish in the front of his pants to hide it. On the ride home the fish is warming up and wriggling and he's trying to ignore it by talking to his dad, but he can't help himself from the sensation and nuts in his pants all over the fish. After getting home he pulls the fish out, cleans the cum off of it and cleans himself up. Taken by that experience, he keeps the fish in the mini-fridge in his bedroom and whenever he wants to whack off, he pulls the fish out and busts all over it. He does this over and over. Regular porn no longer entices him, as the best sensation he's ever felt is a fish wriggling to death against his dick. He can't beat off without thinking about the fish, but there's no porn for that online. He says \"I'll never forget that feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\" He doesn't like fish as a food really, he prefers medium rare steak. He is eventually discovered by his dad because the smell of a fish being defrosted, covered in cum, then cleaned and refrozen starts to become prominent. He lies that it's not his fish, a friend gave it to him. His relationship with his dad is ruined.\n",

            "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy. Strategy His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand. The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells. A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more. The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball. However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter. Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value. In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation. Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage. When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings. Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building. Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox. If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique. For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed. For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa. They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower. The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push. A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower. - \\[ \\] This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower. The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it. A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense. The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is. A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily. A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough .\n",

            "It turns out, Finland is not a real country. Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it's fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It's unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920's, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody's going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there's a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It's a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of 'Nokia' products. This is why Nokia is the largest 'Finnish' company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I'll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they're from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland's other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland's three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn't a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It's not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There's a lot to it and it couldn't all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn't need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It's a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that's where the problems about Finland's existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I'm Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I'm simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn't actually there. It doesn't mean there can't be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement 'I don't believe Finland exists'. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It's part of the human condition. 10- What about GPS and Satellite Images? A. Manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as 'Finnish zones' the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. Satellite images can be forged.\n",

We would rotate who's place we'd drink at every week.

After a while one of the girls suggested we play drinking games and after a while they were both butt ass naked in my apartment, all three of us plastered. It was getting close to midnight and we decided to get in bed, my 22 year old mind thinking if I played my cards right I could live a fantasy that many young men have, a threesome with two girls that in my book were both solid 8-9's. So they get in my bed and I head to the bathroom because I really had to pee and didn't want to be interrupted once I had gotten in bed. \n",

I got so dizzy I had to sit down, so I did on the floor in front of the toilet, just in case. Good call there because a short time later I was projectile vomiting in the toilet, on the toilet, and all over myself. I passed out right there on the bathroom floor covered in puke. \n",

The girls were asleep by then and everything was a mess so I clean up the bathroom and get in the shower, figure I can at least share my bed with 2 beautiful girls in sleepy time for the rest of the night. Turned on the shower then the dizzies hit once more so I sat down in the tub with the shower running and pass out once again. In my drunken state I hadn't properly closed the shower curtain either so the shower was running for a few hours with the curtain open and me passed out in it. After waking once again and realizing I had flooded my bathroom and soaked my carpet. I also noticed the distinct smell of shit but I didn't know from where because as far as I knew I was the only one in the bathroom all night and I hadn't poo'd. Either way, while cleaning up the flood the girls woke up, got dressed, said their goodbyes and went home. \n",

My jeans were full of shit, I had found the mystery smell! Apparently while projectile vomiting I also shit myself but never realized it till later. None of the three of us ever spoke of that night again though we stopped drinking together after that, un unspoken agreement that we all understood. After that night I became a much more conservative drinker. I decided from that point on I'd like to end each night on my own terms and never blow an opportunity like that again.\n",

            "Dude…I saw Monica Bellucci live once in Venice while she was recording Mozart in the Jungle. I lost my mind. My whole family was having an awkward group boner/meltdown. Even my mom. My mom. She undressed that woman with her eyes and fanned herself like her arm malfunctioned and was flushing hard. My 4 brothers were blushing ear to ear like idiots and the little one burst himself and ran to a bathroom before my brothers followed him and gingerly came back like 5 minutes later. My dad put the brave front for all of us. He was so cool and collected and trying to not act like a dog in front me and mom. So he just took a fashion magazine I had and was alternating between fanning mom and himself. We were just walking around when my family and I happened on the set location. The sex appeal that woman has and unleashes is mind boggling. Like she’s just so free, unhinged and elegant on top of it. It was my first time in Venice. I was having so much fun but I discovered there and there that people definitely add to the magic of life. She’s so womanly and lush. As a woman, I feel not enough women fully allow to let their full natures out (for good reason) and she does (she’s got two huge body guards that look like Snorlax though). To feel so confident and safe to just be beautiful and sexy in the open is so mesmerizing. Her smile is breathtaking. In person, she’s eons prettier. Like the pictures and movies seriously don’t do her justice. Honestly if I had the luxury/money she does I’d be nothing less than what she is and embodies. Like a walking fertility god. She’s like both the woman everyone wants to be when they grow up and the woman we want to bone. If she had any bisexual inklings, man…some people aren’t worth the hype, but Signorina Bellucci is worth the hype. She was so nice and actually came to us and greeted us. We were all blushing like we were going to combust and all we could do was stare at her beautiful cleavage and eyes. My dad giggled like a little girl and my brothers did the avoidant staring guys do when they’re trying to not sexualize a woman. Her perfume was so beautiful, like spicy golden honey. The knowing smile she flashed my mom while my dad was just agape was epic. I got so mad she didn’t flash me her teeth like that. My mom’s hella straight but apparently she had second thoughts when she saw Monica and Monica caught it. Next to the word “woman” should be her picture because she honestly she’s got it. The first time in my life where I sympathized with men and their blue balls as I had an inconceivable urge to have her carry my eggs and I’m a woman. So did my mom. I didn’t know how I’d manage to scramble our eggs as I was still “innocent” but then my brain did all the dirty work for me.

            " last year, my husband discovered Destiny’s Child. I don’t know how he wasn’t aware of them before, but that’s beside the point. He obviously didn’t have this obsession before we were married. In fact, we have been married for 7 years, and he’d never exhibited any signs of obsessive behavior before this. Now, his obsession is taking over both of our lives and costing us a lot of money. He spends all day on eBay bidding on Destiny’s Child merch. He is always the highest bidder, so it’s very expensive. He is only subscribed to streaming services so he can listen to them. He bought a Bluetooth shower speaker so he can listen to them while he bathes. We cannot have one conversation without him saying something like, “You know, this actually reminds me of a Destiny’s Child lyric.” He’s spent hours watching YouTube tutorials, learning the choreography from every video. He makes me sit down and watch him dance in front of the TV to make sure his form and timing are perfect. He emails the members often, begging them for a reunion tour. He has also sent them birthday gifts in the mail. I would like to point out that his obsession is not sexual in any way— he just thinks they’re really cool. I’m almost to my wit’s end. I feel like I can’t escape Destiny’s Child and have lost my husband completely to this obsession. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n",

            "Pardon my intrusion on your excitingly important conversation, but simply must comment on what one of you had said earlier, which I have stumbled upon and believe to be a reference, the action of mentioning or alluding to something, to the widely popular animation made in Japan that centers around a man, from the largely wealthy Joestar family, around the industrial Revolution, to be exact the year 1880, where the man named Jonathan Joestar fights the famous villain Dio, in order to restore peace to his family. This famous story continues through his bloodline onto loseph Joestar, who also posses the powers known to only a few around the world. The story slowly progresses with each important member of the Joestar family living out their lives around each other. As the title to the Japanese animation suggests, the show is quite strange and unusual, forcing everything out of each character. The starring cast, or Joestar family rarely dies on screen, however the supporting cast favorites die often, leaving the audience in complete shock and tears, Called \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\" by Hirohiko Araki if i am correct?\n",

            "Expressing feelings of insecurity over her appearance, an organic raspberry revealed Thursday that she was incredibly self-conscious about her amount of body hair. “I know it says more about society than it does about me, but I still feel pretty bad about all this fuzz,” said the raspberry, admitting that it was difficult to maintain self-esteem and confidence when she could notice people recoiling at the sight of her hair. “I’ve tried to get rid of it, but it always grows back even more patchy and coarse than before. It’s just hard to look at my peers and not feel inferior—blueberries have such smooth skin. I’ve heard the other berries talking shit, calling me the ‘hirsute fruit.’ God, sometimes I hope I get tossed into a blender and chopped up for a smoothie.” At press time, the visibly depressed raspberry cursed her Greek origins for her tragic predicament.\n",
            "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

Using your buff, well-toned arm, lob the barbecue sauce out the window at exactly 100 meters per second at an angle directly parallel to the outside ground. Assuming that the barbecue sauce weighs 0.56 kilograms, acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 meters per second, and initial vertical velocity is zero, the barbecue sauce should take exactly 1.11 seconds to reach the ground ignoring air resistance. This gives you exactly 1.11 seconds to escape the vicinity before the barbecue sauce lands on the ground and explodes into a lethal fireball as all nearby objects are incinerated by a common household condiment burning at six thousand degrees Celsius. A single tear escapes your eye, as you realize that you will probably never taste the sweet nectar of Sweet Baby Ray’s again. Not after the sigma variant caused the downfall of the barbecue sauce supply chain, a great regime whose unwavering glory surpassed that of the Roman Empire at its peak.\n",

Assuming that you have not been lacking, you should easily be able to replicate the compression effects of a chemically-fueled implosion assembly nuclear weapon explosive lens with your bare hands to force the fissile uranium into supercriticality, causing an exponential growth of nuclear chain reactions that releases two hundred twenty-six billion joules of energy into the surrounding environment.\n",

            "We usually kinda joke-argue a lot. We both find it funny, but I suppose sometimes it can go quite far. Well it seems that’s just happened. As when he started making fun of my weight, I called him, “you son of a Shrek” in retaliation. He has told me about his insecurity with his looks, but I figured calling him the son of a Shrek would lessen the blow (rather than just straight-up Shrek head)— but he doesn’t think so. I mean, I didn’t even really call him Shrek. Son of a Shrek just means he has part Shrek in him. But anyways, I digress. He now refuses to have sex and is being sulky. Seems like I’ve got under his green skin.\n",
            "Dude…I saw Monica Bellucci live once in Venice while she was recording Mozart in the Jungle. I lost my mind. My whole family was having an awkward group boner/meltdown. Even my mom. My mom. She undressed that woman with her eyes and fanned herself like her arm malfunctioned and was flushing hard. My 4 brothers were blushing ear to ear like idiots and the little one burst himself and ran to a bathroom before my brothers followed him and gingerly came back like 5 minutes later. My dad put the brave front for all of us. He was so cool and collected and trying to not act like a dog in front me and mom. So he just took a fashion magazine I had and was alternating between fanning mom and himself. We were just walking around when my family and I happened on the set location. The sex appeal that woman has and unleashes is mind boggling. Like she’s just so free, unhinged and elegant on top of it. It was my first time in Venice. I was having so much fun but I discovered there and there that people definitely add to the magic of life. She’s so womanly and lush. As a woman, I feel not enough women fully allow to let their full natures out (for good reason) and she does (she’s got two huge body guards that look like Snorlax though). To feel so confident and safe to just be beautiful and sexy in the open is so mesmerizing. Her smile is breathtaking. In person, she’s eons prettier. Like the pictures and movies seriously don’t do her justice. Honestly if I had the luxury/money she does I’d be nothing less than what she is and embodies. Like a walking fertility god. She’s like both the woman everyone wants to be when they grow up and the woman we want to bone. If she had any bisexual inklings, man…some people aren’t worth the hype, but Signorina Bellucci is worth the hype. She was so nice and actually came to us and greeted us. We were all blushing like we were going to combust and all we could do was stare at her beautiful cleavage and eyes. My dad giggled like a little girl and my brothers did the avoidant staring guys do when they’re trying to not sexualize a woman. Her perfume was so beautiful, like spicy golden honey. The knowing smile she flashed my mom while my dad was just agape was epic. I got so mad she didn’t flash me her teeth like that. My mom’s hella straight but apparently she had second thoughts when she saw Monica and Monica caught it. Next to the word “woman” should be her picture because she honestly she’s got it. The first time in my life where I sympathized with men and their blue balls as I had an inconceivable urge to have her carry my eggs and I’m a woman. So did my mom. I didn’t know how I’d manage to scramble our eggs as I was still “innocent” but then my brain did all the dirty work for me. I felt like fucking pressure cooker and I thought I was going to die from overheating. The weather was perfectly fine that day but it felt like that time we had a heatwave…We all still reminisce over the infamous family boner.\n",
            "The weakest kurd &lt;:gigachad:912725273785536572&gt;, the strongest turkroach 🏳️‍⚧️, a ukrainian pig, a romanian gypsy, an albanian, and an Indian man were at a bar in Swedistan. The Indian goes outside to take a shit, the Albanian tries to steal his rectum while the gypsy Romanian pickpockets him. The Kurd sees a goat next to them and decides to unzip meanwhile an Arab prepares bombs in front of the bartender. That's when the Swedistani police come in and rape the criminals as they yell \"j-jeg elsker svensk kuk~!\", the criminals barely escape to the mongolian land of Finland, but the Arab (Kraken) then becomes trans due to the traumatic experience. The Analbanians and gypsies aren't affected due to their Balkan Sigma male grindset. Honestly quite incredible.\n",
            "I hope you stub your toe and anytime it's almost healed you stub it again then when you go to lay down all your pillows are warm on both sides. Anytime you heat a meal in the microwave or oven it's just too cold and when you cook it longer it burns to the point of inedibility. Then when you put clothes on they're so cold they feel wet and they stay that way. Then whenever you sleep you wake up just soon enough before your alarm to be fully aware of what's happening by the time it goes off but you've set it to a heavy metal song on full blast so it wakes up everyone nearby. I hope you always have one nasal cavity that you can barely breathe out of and have to consistently blow your nose. I hope the internet on your Xbox stops working right as you bought one month of Xbox live gold. I hope anything chewy you eat has one crunchy bite. I hope you reread the same part of a text multiple times before realizing you've done it. I hope you get really paranoid somethings gonna happen and it happens afterwards. I hope you get a 99.99 for a final grade. I hope you get bee stung when drinking anything outside. I hope you grow up to have a lovely wife and family then she cheats on you takes the kids all your money and makes you pay child support on a minimum wage job in a cramped apartment with a leaky faucet. I hope your bread is always wet. I hope you get holes in all your socks that only your big toe can slide out of. I hope that you have the best dreams ever only to wake up and forget them. I hope you can only charge any device by holding the cord at a certain angle. I hope any picture frame or anything you hang up is slightly off. I hope you crave chic-fil-a only on Sundays. I hope next time you put on shoes they're still sweaty and warm from last time you wore them. I hope you get an itch that moves when you scratch it. I hope when you lay down looking at your phone it hits you in the face. I hope that the pin in the public bathroom never slides to lock it. I hope that anytime you show someone a picture they take your phone and scroll through it. I hope whenever you wash dishes the spoon shoots water back onto you. I hope you always have to. Whenever you get laundry out I hope it's just a little damp so you don't put it back in but it feels soaking when you put it on.\n",
            "So I saw an attractive woman on the sidewalk today. She was an attractive woman. She was taller, which was also attractive. Maybe an attractive 6'5\" or so. Her attractive legs were also quite attractive, with their attractive thighs being even more attractive. Combined with how attractively they paired up with her attractive rear end was quite attractive indeed. Her attractive breasts were also quite attractive, being on the smaller side, C-cups, but still attractive nonetheless. Now I know what you're thinking. C-cups? Those aren't very attractive. But yes they were indeed. By being attractive, but not extremely attractive, they were even more attractive. Her attractive head was also shaped in an attractive way, further adding to the attractiveness. Don't even get me started on her attractive face with how attractive it was, with the attractive nose, being attractively sized to match the rest of her attractive facial proportions, was incredibly attractive. Her attractive blue eyes, attractive long blonde hair, attractive ears, attractive pale yet tan skin, was all very attractive. And the attractive way she was attractively walking on the attractive sidewalk? Attractive indeed. As I looked at her, I couldn't help but think \"Damn, that attractive woman is quite attractive,\" and can you blame me? This woman was very attractive.\n",

            "Dude…I saw Monica Bellucci live once in Venice while she was recording Mozart in the Jungle. I lost my mind. My whole family was having an awkward group boner/meltdown. Even my mom. My mom. She undressed that woman with her eyes and fanned herself like her arm malfunctioned and was flushing hard. My 4 brothers were blushing ear to ear like idiots and the little one burst himself and ran to a bathroom before my brothers followed him and gingerly came back like 5 minutes later. My dad put the brave front for all of us. He was so cool and collected and trying to not act like a dog in front me and mom. So he just took a fashion magazine I had and was alternating between fanning mom and himself. We were just walking around when my family and I happened on the set location. The sex appeal that woman has and unleashes is mind boggling. Like she’s just so free, unhinged and elegant on top of it. It was my first time in Venice. I was having so much fun but I discovered there and there that people definitely add to the magic of life. She’s so womanly and lush. As a woman, I feel not enough women fully allow to let their full natures out (for good reason) and she does (she’s got two huge body guards that look like Snorlax though). To feel so confident and safe to just be beautiful and sexy in the open is so mesmerizing. Her smile is breathtaking. In person, she’s eons prettier. Like the pictures and movies seriously don’t do her justice. Honestly if I had the luxury/money she does I’d be nothing less than what she is and embodies. Like a walking fertility god. She’s like both the woman everyone wants to be when they grow up and the woman we want to bone. If she had any bisexual inklings, man…some people aren’t worth the hype, but Signorina Bellucci is worth the hype. She was so nice and actually came to us and greeted us.

            " NEI ( not enough information) As any based gigagchad redditor, and a man of culture, I know there are various subgenres and subtleties within the scat fetish porn category. Now, I specifically mention the scat genre, because, while I am a very based gigachad (fortnite bad, women bad, ect.) I am not a discord admin, nor a content creator on youtube, nor do i play LoL (league of legends), and thus cannot legally experience attraction to children. So I will stick to what I do know, which is the scat genre. For example, was scat the focal point of the porn? Or was it merely a secondary prop, with the primary focus on the act of sexual intercourse? Was it smeared on the body? Consumed? Used as a sexual object? How many subjects were there? Was it a single person with coprophilia (the scientific term for people who want to fuck shit and cum) or were there multiple individuals involved? Were there other kinks such as exhibitionism, degradation, or punishment? What was the setting? In a septic tank or sewer, or in a traditional setting, such as the step sisters bedroom or the laundry room? What was the production quality? OP, until you provide this information, I cannot make a judgement. This is likely the reason you were bullied, for leaving out basic, yet important information on reddit posts. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, but it is likely that you are the asshole, and should make a scat porn as an apology.\n",

            " Stormer is an assault infantryman, shock trooper - Stormtrooper. Each brigade od ARBiH had somehting called IDV or IDC, a \"Reconnaissance-Sabotage \" platoon or company, in which the best soldiers served. Although they certainly scouted and carried out diversions, the main purpose of such units was infantry assault, usually by infiltration. Such units in some brigades grew into battalion sized assault detachments who were spearheading brigades assaults etc.. Look up Imperial German Stormtroopers, in essence same problem (how to breach entrenched positions), same idea, same tactics. Our Stormer is chasing away gusle, a one wire instrument which Serbs use to sing folk and nationalistic songs and two headed eagle, a Serb national symbol, from Bosnian forests ie. he is chasing away Serb aggressors.  🤭\n",

            "When I was about 13, I went fishing with my dad. I caught a fish, and I was really happy about it. I just felt like I had a connection with the fish it just felt very nice in my hands. It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn't do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

            "Firstly the penis is more iconic with it's long thick stem and the head being an it's head with a design resembling a mushroom which, being one of the first lifeforms on the planet even preceding plants and barely changing over the millions of years it has existed shows that the penis's design is greay but, the penis makes the mushroom's design even better by taking the head of it and making it more aerodynamic which, gives it the ability to bulldoze through everything and everyone. The penis is a sign of masterfully crafted excellence, the ballsack on the other hand is just a bunch of organs haphazardly thrown together into a skin sack.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly the human body spends way more resources on the penis than it ever spends on the ballsack. The human body specially pumps penis full of blood but, the might of the penis's might is so unparalleled that it uses up all of the body's resources if used for long stretches of time. The penis is only activated on a special occasion; the ballsack just hangs around.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thirdly the penis has many imitators because it's a beautifully crafted device, as they say: \"Imitation is the best form of flattery.\" The ballsack having barely any imitators to speak of is a sign of its inferior design. The mighty penis is the one to start many great businesses and an entire industry not the ballsack.\n",
            "\n",
            "And finally the feeling of sucking a penis Is a feeling of pure ecstasy, nothing will ever beat the feeling of sucking on a big meaty penis.

The ballsack is a plaything the penis is to be taken seriously.\n",

The first time in my life where I sympathized with men and their blue balls as I had an inconceivable urge to have her carry my eggs and I’m a woman. So did my mom.

            "Dude…I saw Monica Bellucci live once in Venice while she was recording Mozart in the Jungle. I lost my mind. My whole family was having an awkward group boner/meltdown. Even my mom. My mom. She undressed that woman with her eyes and fanned herself like her arm malfunctioned and was flushing hard. My 4 brothers were blushing ear to ear like idiots and the little one burst himself and ran to a bathroom before my brothers followed him and gingerly came back like 5 minutes later. My dad put the brave front for all of us. He was so cool and collected and trying to not act like a dog in front me and mom. So he just took a fashion magazine I had and was alternating between fanning mom and himself. We were just walking around when my family and I happened on the set location. The sex appeal that woman has and unleashes is mind boggling. Like she’s just so free, unhinged and elegant on top of it. It was my first time in Venice. I was having so much fun but I discovered there and there that people definitely add to the magic of life. She’s so womanly and lush. As a woman, I feel not enough women fully allow to let their full natures out (for good reason) and she does (she’s got two huge body guards that look like Snorlax though). To feel so confident and safe to just be beautiful and sexy in the open is so mesmerizing. Her smile is breathtaking. In person, she’s eons prettier. Like the pictures and movies seriously don’t do her justice. Honestly if I had the luxury/money she does I’d be nothing less than what she is and embodies. Like a walking fertility god. She’s like both the woman everyone wants to be when they grow up and the woman we want to bone. If she had any bisexual inklings, man…some people aren’t worth the hype, but Signorina Bellucci is worth the hype. She was so nice and actually came to us and greeted us. We were all blushing like we were going to combust and all we could do was stare at her beautiful cleavage and eyes. My dad giggled like a little girl and my brothers did the avoidant staring guys do when they’re trying to not sexualize a woman. Her perfume was so beautiful, like spicy golden honey.

Now hypothetically speaking, this could be satire and bringing attention to dating violence. On the other note, people say it’s a part of the Incel movement. For example, one video to me is sort of funny where he says he’s going to feed his date to the sharks. I can see humor in that.

That 2018 and 2019 were the last good years before covid times and 2013 had the best mobile apps to play. 2014 and 2015 seem to be left to the wayside despite them being peak 10's along with 2016 and had elements of the early 10's left behind but also the first few specks of the culture that would dominate the late 10's. I think this is because we have not yet reached the 10 year mark of those years unlike 2010-2012 currently and many may think 7-8 years ago are too recent to feel nostalgia for. As well as the late 2010's still being fresh in everyone's minds and the last few years of greatness (relative to present day) before the 2020's began.\n",

I think it’s more of a maturity issue than a generational one.

Then in mid April my school board decides to say \"F it\" and we didn't have to do work anymore so from mid April through the rest of the school year we didn't have to do work. The 2020 class's graduation was postponed from May to June so they graduated a month later than they normally would've, and they're graduation was normal it was on the football field and you didn't have to wear a mask, just like a normal pre-covid graduation. \n",

Our work was insanely easy we would get on this website called \"plato.web\" and there were different assignments for us to do and you could just copy and paste the problem onto a website called \"brianly\" and it gave you the answer to everyone so everyday I got done within an hour and had the whole rest of the school day to do whatever I wanted.

I honestly don't care if I die cause at least I would have been selfless for once in my life so the whole \"you could get hurt or killed\" thing doesn't sway me. I also don't care about the pay or possible psychological damage all I really want out of enlisting is either a roof over my head and free food or the capability to sacrifice something for others since I grew up with not a lot and ik what it's like to not have the kind of \"perfect American\" life most people have yk. So if I enlist at least I can help someone and I don't see myself ever doing something as selfless if I get a degree and a good-paying job and attempt to live a \"cookie-cutter\" life.\n",

The mid-2010s were an amazing time to be alive, things hadn't gotten political yet (in 2013-2015, that is) and the internet pop culture felt very similar to it in the early 2010s. The only real difference I could think of between the early and mid-2010s was that the mid-2010s had more advanced technology than the then early half, but I don't see how that's a bad thing. In the early 2010s people were already glued to screens and would walk around with their phones out, nothing really changed in the mid-2010s technology-wise. Yes, new consoles did release in the mid-2010s but not everyone got them as soon as they came out, most people still used Xbox 360/PS3 when the mid-2010s started. The mid 2010s were barely any different from the early 2010s excluding 2016, I don't get why people hate on them so much!\n",

Compared to a 1997-2012 Z range where the first half is likely to solidly remember parts of the 2000s so we're able to make judgement from our own experiences. But most people born past 2014/2015 wouldn't be able to tell you what the 2010s are like. I believe 2010s nostalgia will start springing up in the second half of this decade, so would they just view it the same people born in like 2005+ see the 2000s?

            "1. 2012 - This should not surprise most people, since 2012 is typically considered one of the greatest years to be alive. Even though I cannot clearly remember the entire year of 2012, I do clearly remember the later part of the year after I entered first grade, which I consider to be the best time of my life! I remember playing lots of Minecraft with my brother, having a ton of friends at school, being obsessed over Minecraft songs (I used to be embarrassed by this, now I wear it as a badge of honor), and taking a trip to my grandparent's house which will always be one of my most favorite memories. 2012 was the first year I truly felt like a kid and it was the year that I started getting into pop culture, which is why I know about a lot of 2012 trends. 10/10\n",
            "2. 2014 - Another one of my favs! 2014 was just a lot of fun for me, I had a ton of friends at school and was really into football at the time. I remember playing sports with my friends at recess and feeling great about myself when I won, and I was sort of known as being the best kicker in my school. This is also the year that I got unlimited access to the internet, so I really stetting familiar with the current trends and even started posting videos to my YouTube channel. 9/10\n",
            "3. 2013 - This year felt very similar to 2012, although I did start getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in back in 2012 so it wasn't as fun. That aside, I still think 2013 is an amazing year and I would love to go back and experience it again! 8.999/10\n",
            "4. 2016 - This year was decent in my opinion, though the summer carries making it a very memorable year for me. My friends and I would hop on Skype every day during that summer and just talk with each other, one time we stayed up late laughing our asses off at memes on Youtube. That night will probably go down as one of the best nights of my life, even if I was only 10! I was also decently edgy during 2016, I watched a lot of LeafyIsHere/Idubbz/Keemstar during this year and would talk about the Youtube drama with my friends at school. 2016 is one of the most memorable years of my life and I personally enjoyed it, 8.5/10.\n",
            "5. 2017 - Nothing too special happened in this year, though nothing really bad happened either. This year was pretty fun for me, especially the later part of it. I started playing Fortnite around September of 2017, which is why I am ranking this year so high. The old Fortnite carried the second part of 2017, it was the first time since 2012 that I felt a burning passion for a video game and I genuinely felt like I was a 6-year-old again when playing it. That being said, 2017 was a pretty shitty year for me as well. I got bullied a lot in school during this year and my best friend moved away which sucked. This was also the first year that I felt like I was completely DONE with my childhood, in 2016 I still felt a little bit like a kid but by 2017 I felt like an adolescent. 2017 is a weird year for me, but I'd say it is pretty underrated. 7.5/10\n",
            "6. 2019 - I did sort of like 2019. Lots of people shit on this year due to how modern it is, but I have to disagree with them. 2019 was an ok year for me, although the winter of 2019 carried this year for sure. I don't have too much to say about this year, it was fun but overall felt too modern for my likening. 7/10\n",
            "7. 2015 - I am NOT ranking 2015 high because I think the year itself was bad. This year was great, it was the last year before politics were a massive part of everyday life (even for people who weren't into them), and 2015 was the last year with early 2010s culture influence. Even though 2015 was a good year in itself, for me it definitely wasn't. I got bullied a lot during this year and last a lot of my friends, I also remember having a ton of headaches in 2015 because of how much I grinded my teeth back then. I also started getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in before, I have a very specific memory of me playing Minecraft in 2015 and genuinely feeling depressed because it didn't have the same charm to it as it did 3 years prior. This wasn't just with Minecraft as well, lots of other things I was interested in back in 2012-2014 randomly became boring in 2015 for no reason at all. While 2015 was a great year in itself, for me it was not the best. 6.5/10\n",
            "8. 2018 - This year was probably one of my worst. This is when puberty was starting to affect me, and I lost practically all my friends due to switching schools midway through the year. I got bullied a lot during 2018, probably my worst year for bullying so far. A bunch of kids from my school found my old Youtube channel from when I was 8 and would constantly bully me for it, leading to me deleting the channel (I regret doing that to this day). In conclusion, I became extremely depressed during this year and I did not like the pop culture of it at all. 5/10\n",
            "9. 2021 - This year was very weird for me, it had its moments but I did not like this one at all. Even the lockdowns were lifted this year, it didn't feel the same as pre-covid life. I still had to wear a mask and lots of events I enjoyed doing before covid were canceled due to the Delta variant. I also was very addicted to social media throughout this year, especially Twitter which is one of the worst platforms I've ever seen.

            "The  Bureau of Labor Statistics' January jobs report was recenlty released  stating that the economy added 467,000 jobs last month. This is a  surprise considering many observers and the White House itself thought  that it would show a decline in employment of about that same level.  Their belief has to do with the way virus related business closures and  work disruptions are counted in the report. For good reason workers  unable to work because of covid infections and at home are considered to  be layed off, and we all know about the high level of person to person  transmission that struck the nation over the past month and can see the  number of business and other facility closures it has caused. So why  then was the figure we got today so rosey and how does it compare with  other less well known but perhaps more reliable government statistics  that try and tell us something about the labor market.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among  a host of other challenges involved in understanding the household and  establishment surveys that make up the BLS report which I have discussed  elsewhere there is the fact that all data in these surveys are  SEASONALLY ADJUSTED. This sounds like a means to take seasonal factors  such as weather into account when calculating how many jobs were created  or destroyed, but they're really a practice by which long-run averaging  is used to disguise volatility in the figures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The  downside to this is that it can misrepresent the actual situation. Say  the economy's been in a slump for a prolonged period and the average of  jobs lost each month is -300,000. Then a number above -300,000 for a  given month even if still negative at say -100,000, could still be  counted as positive. The same goes for positive numbers; with an average  of +300,000 jobs a month a number below that, say +200,000, could be  ADJUSTED to show a less positive or even negative number. This is to  some extent an oversimplification of the process but gets across the  manner in which such figures are constructed. And the same sort of  method is also applied to the unemployment rate and all other economic  date from the government. So we can see how unreliable much of this is.\n",
            "\n",
            "In  fact in this past July's jobs report this is stated outright when the  bureau writes “\\[s\\]taffing fluctuations in education due to the pandemic  have distorted the normal seasonal buildup and layoff patterns, likely  contributing to the job gains in July. Without the typical seasonal  employment increases earlier, there were fewer layoffs at the end of the  school year, resulting in job gains after seasonal adjustment. These  variations make it more challenging to discern the current  employment  trends in these education industries.” (The Employment Situation July  2021 p. 3)  [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit\\_08062021.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_08062021.pdf)\n",
            "\n",
            "So  think of it, some months when jobs are actually gained we see a loss  and in some months when there are really losses we're told there are  gains. **A better if still  imperfect measure of the jobs situation can be found in another measure  in the BLS report called the Employment-Population Ratio.** This  number, if still seasonally adjusted, tries to compare the actual number  of people with a job to the entire working age population of the United  States. Unfortunately it fails to take into account the number of stay  at home mothers, who actually are not in the labor force, but in our  modern world this is such a rarity that statistically it shouldn't  impact the overall data too much.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In this month's report the EMPLOYMENT-POPULATION RATIO IS A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED 59.7.**  That means 40.3% of people 22 and older, according to this measure, are  without a job. If we subtract the about 12% of the population who are  actually retired we get a a jobless rate of at 27.7%. (The Employment  Situation January 2022 p. 8 Summary Table A.)

            "Still  there is a seperate set of government employment figures this time  released by the Census Bureau, which tell a somewhat different story.  Since the beginning of the pandemic they have been tasked with compiling  a newer Household Pulse Survey designed to give us a more real-time  assesment of the US labor market and other information. These measures  are taken every two weeks or so and not only work to give us a better  picture of the employment situation, but also wider social trends  regarding food security and education since the onset of covid-19. For  the week ending January 10th this study puts the number of unemployed  Americans at 107,302,764 out of an adult population of 250,265,449. That  would give us a figure of about 42%. Still when combining this with the  number of Americans represented by those who failed to respond to the  survey (8,374,956) we get a number nearer 46%.\n",
            "\n",
            "This  is important because prior to Week 34 (July 21-August 2 2021) of the  series only about one to two million Americans would be represented in  this last category, with the figure shooting up to between 8,000,000 and  11,000,000 in the subsequent periods. This may very well represent a  fall in motivation to fill out the survey among a cohort of workers who  previously gained new employment after the initial nationwide  quarentines and massive job losses but have since re-entered the ranks  of the unemployed. (The usual category of “No” job  rising to  107,302,764 in the most recent period from 100,790,156 in the time from  December 1-13 just before Christmas.\n",

Now that I’m in high school I realized that I’m a 2010’s kid and my childhood was amazing either way. I feel like with us 2010’s kids (early/mid), we had a lot of influence from the late 2000’s. We watched a lot of kids shows that started in the 2000’s even tho that’s not from our “era.” At least I did. I remember watching shows like The Proud Family, Kim Possible, Teen Titans, Ben 10, That’s So Raven, Drake &amp;amp;amp; Josh, Zoey 101, etc. I mean favorite cartoon ever is Codename: Kids next Door. The first memory I can remember came in like 09 or 2010 and it was about some of the Ben 10 toys I had. At the same time tho I still watched all the good shows that came out during my time like Jessie, ICarly, Hannah Montana, Regular Show, Adventure Time, Suite Life, Gravity Falls, BTR etc. Same thing with movies too, Some of my favorites being Alvin and the Chipmunks, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Real Steel, How to train your Dragon, The Incredibles and so many more. Anyways, what I’m trying to say is that it doesn’t matter what decade you are a kid from. All that matters is that YOU had a good childhood. No matter if your a 2000’s kid or a 90’s kid or a 2010’s kid, you can all be nostalgic over the same things. Just cause they wereborn a year or two after you doesn’t mean they couldn’t have watched similar shows. It’s YOUR memories and no one else’s.\n",

I still think these are just two negatives though when considering all of it together, and it’s still the best all-around despite these.\n",

And what she basically said to me, was that the best way to combat all that time of developing this difficult network where my neurons attack themselves is by rewiring it yourself.

It lasted for about a year and a half, up until a few months ago when I decided that I couldn’t keep letting myself get away with it, as I had college on the horizon and I would need to dedicate more time to my studies. I’m an artist and an art student (graphic design specifically), and since I stopped watching porn, I gained a greater appreciation for the human form in a more innocent sense. It is for this reason that I began to enjoy tasteful nudity, both in photos and in art, as well as a few other reasons, the most notable one being that pornography always felt very fake. The actors never felt real to me. Even when I would indulge in porn, I could tell that they were just playing it up for the camera. At the time, I had no reason to care, but now I do; and if the actors aren’t having a good time, why should I be having a good time? This is what drew me to tasteful nudity in the first place. Models always look far more genuinely content than porn actors do, and I’m a fan of that.\n",

It’s a cheap, fake, imitation of love and I didn’t want to feel that anymore, and so I forced myself to stop. And now, I feel like I’m a better person because of that choice. I have my wonderful partner to thank for this. They may never know of this, and they may never have to, but they truly changed my life, and I will be forever grateful for that.\n",
            "When I was in deep depression, such messages and campaigns didn't help me and they still don't. I imagine this is what it's like for most people when they feel alone and helpless; they want someone that's close to them, someone whom they feel truly cares about them personally, not strangers listening to them on a superficial level. They want friends, not just listeners. I know that some people also just wish to feel understood, but I think many people feel the same I feel.\n",
            "Just to be clear, I am not trying to be insensitive in anyway, and anyone's premature death (as long as they aren't some sort of murderer) is tragic. I just find it kind of strange that if a celebrity dies, people all over the world mourns even though they don't know them personally. I think this can sometimes be upsetting for their actual family at times to be constantly reminded over the internet and news that your loved one is gone. Not to mention the conspiracies that sometimes arise and often times it seems like people are more complaining about their deaths than actually mourning which is even worse to see, but while all of that is happening, thousands of other people die without being noticed as if they are so insignificant. Obviously not everyone can be recognized when they die, and I am not saying that everyone should be treated like a celebrity. All I am saying is that it is strange how people act when someone they don't know dies and of course there is no actual solution to this, people will just be people, I just think its kind of depressing.\n",

The first way of looking at it means that instead of catering to a customer you should understand and listen to what they are asking for an adapt to the situation. Now if the customer is an asshole or doesn’t understand that then that’s a separate issue and some people are unreasonable but not majority of customers. The second meaning is that consumers want what they want. If you are making a product or business and it’s not popular or successful it’s because you didn’t meet the demands of consumers and give them what they want as a collective whole. You failed because it didn’t resonate with people. Even if you are doing something unique or different you have to make consumers want it.\n",

If a relationship lasts more than a year and ends on good terms, it's a show of maturity to recognize that they're an ex as well as a human being.. Friend. I'm not suggesting stalking or persistence should be encouraged, if people are taught the importance of breaking up early in life, we'll all still have exes who root for us or who can act as a very distant lifeline in the event of an emergency. I understand that getting hurt is nearly unavoidable, but maturity means knowing that your ex will have a new partner, and that this new partner should accept and even appreciate your former. Your partner should also do their best to keep matters in good terms. Basically, even if they've become exes, everyone should just be friends. Whether this can also grant casual-sex to give more of a \"good\" spirit send off shouldn't be a big deal to the new partner just so closure can happen.\n",

Youtube's algorithm is dependant on watch time, meaning it doesnt matter if the content is edifying or genuinely good or anything - as long as it grabs your attention, thats enough.

Plus, you don't even have to peel the skin off of the orange, since it's fairly easy, kids as young as 3 years old can even peel oranges.   \n",

They're also low in calories, which make them good for diets. Tangerines decrease the risk of heart disease, and also improve blood sugar levels.   \n",
