There may well be versions of the exposure triangle which are very different from this as the internet is full of somewhat different, though typically quite similar versions of the thing. The god of triangles has many faces.\n",

            "## About definitions\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's consider the false premise: [exposure is defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)) to be the amount of light per unit area reaching the film/sensor as determined by shutter speed, lens F-number, and scene luminance. The definition one can find from the vocabulary of International Organization for Standardization is similar to Wikipedia's: *total quantity of light allowed to fall upon a photosensitive emulsion or an imaging sensor (measured in lux seconds)*. (It doesn't mention \"per unit area\", but since it mentions the unit to be lux second it means \"per unit area\" - still a small oversight).\n",
            "\n",
            "[ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed#Digital_camera_ISO_speed_and_exposure_index) is not an exposure parameter. ISO is defined by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as *numerical value* ***calculated from the exposure*** *provided at the focal plane of a DSC to produce specified DSC image signal characteristics*. Thus ISO can't be an exposure parameter since it would be a circular definition. The proper definition of exposure is also logical one since all the parameters have an equal standing - they all directly influence how much light is collected. ISO setting does no such thing.\n",

            "It is also easy to see how the lighting conditions - either natural like the amount of sunlight, or perhaps the use flashlight - change the amount of light that will be used.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also think that it's pretty easy to understand that capturing more light is beneficial for image quality. We all see better during daylight than night.\n",

            "\n",
            "On the other hand the ISO setting itself doesn't influence the flow of light. Adjusting the ISO control of the camera may cause the aperture size or the exposure time to change in autoexposure modes, but not in the manual mode. Similarly adjusting the **exposure compensation** control may cause the aperture size or exposure time to change - should it therefore logically not be a part of *the triangle* as well is ISO is included - is it now an *exposure square*?\n",

Days that I’m not in college I am either doing project work or working part time as a photographer at a studio. After college, the studio I’m working at wants to hire me full time, so in the next couple of weeks, they want to start increasing my part time hours so I can be fully trained up for when I graduate college. The problem I have is that I also want to pursue film/videography when I leave college too and I just bought some equipment to help me build my showreel and video portfolio . However, now I’m regretting buying the equipment after being offered the full time photography job as it will take up a lot of my time. My dad said I should just focus on photography for now but idk. Should I just focus on photography and send back the film gear or should I keep it and try to do a bit of video in my free time?\n",

            "Ok a little back story. I’ve been modeling for photographers for years. Sometimes paid sometimes for free. Recently boudoir photography was recommended to me. I have a lot of respect for some of the boudoir photographers I’ve met but there have been a few where they have felt like they are borderline scamming people. Example: one photographer spoke to me on the phone and booked a shoot with me. I paid for the shoot. The contract stated hair and makeup would be provided but when it came time she had neither and claimed that over the phone she mentioned it wasn’t included and I had agreed to that (I didn’t recall that part of the conversation but I let it slide). I said I’d pay extra for a hairstylist months in advance and a week before she said she couldn’t find one willing to come do hair. (This seemed like red flag number 2 for me). Then she never sent me any information about costs for digital images and packages. When it came time to see the images the cost was substantial. At this point the whole thing had been such a hassle/ disappointment as far as experience etc that I decided to just part ways with the photographer and not purchase images. This was my first time paying a photographer so I was shocked that the experience was worse than when I’m with a photographer who pays me. My question is is this a common issue? How do you tell a legit photographer from someone who doesn’t seem to know what they are doing BEFORE going into a shoot? Are some boudoir photographers engaging in scam like practices? Thoughts? \n",

            "I'm more of an amateur hobbyist. I took photography classes several years ago and my instructor always suggested a two-week turnaround time to release the finished edited photos back to a client so I'm not sure if that's usually the standard. I recently hired a photographer to take photos of my baby for her birthday (which was March 11th). The photoshoot was on February 26th and I chose my favorites out of the unedited gallery on the same day. The photographer said she would have the photos done by the following Wednesday as she was having surgery that day and wanted to have them done beforehand. That Wednesday came and went, and still no photos. No problem though, I was fine with that and only hoped to have the photos by March 11th for my baby's birthday. I still hadn't received the photos by the 11th though so I asked if I could have any photos and she told me I could download one of them that she shared on her Facebook page. She was apologetic and said she was working on them that day and would have them done by the end of the weekend of the 11th. I told her no rush since I understand how rough it can be to recover from surgery. Now it's March 25th (nearly a month later) and I still don't have any of the photos and I'm wondering if I should ask again or if I would be nagging at this point? I don't mean to be impatient.I was hoping to include prints of the photos in the thank you cards I'm going to send out for my baby's birthday gifts. I also had to pay $650 up front for the whole shoot and I bought about 27 photos so I guess I'm getting a little anxious about that.

If you aren't familiar with her, she preaches an in-person sales model as the only way to run a profitable business, has a (paid, of course) education website with loads and loads of content - posing, styling, printing, selling, you name it, and honestly has the charisma and rhetoric of a cult leader. Is the whole thing a cult? No, but it is cult-y, a bit like an MLM. \n",

            "\n",
            "So, with some support from my parents I went for it, quit my job and started my own business after I had done a deep-dive into her content and started building a portfolio for a few months. Now, in-person sales definitely works, and it worked for me once I found the right clients. I also don't think IPS is unethical, as long as you don't bait-and-switch your clients into spending way more than they anticipated. \n",

She is not a nutritionist, it has nothing to do with photography, it is triggering to those with eating disorders (source: I have an ED).

            "She also shoots all types of bodies, although most of her photos feature slim, young women; but there is a section in the course on how to pose larger bodies and she does say representation of all bodies is important - but at the same time, she will rant about how she used to be fat and hated herself and got some gallbladder issue - allegedly because she didn't love herself. I personally think she doesn't want anything to do with fat people but shoots them and makes content about them because people want to see it. (I am not a fat liberation activist and never was fat but this did tickle me.)\n",

            "The group HEAVILY focuses on the Law of Attraction. While I do believe that you are more likely to reach your goals if you focus on them - that is just common sense - this bullshit about \"vibrating at a frequency of gratitude to attract your dream clients and millions of dollars\" is frankly complete and utter esoteric nonsense. It also spits in the face of those who had shit happen to them - Sue had a friend who died of breast cancer, did that woman not love herself enough or vibrate at the right frequency and it's her fault? Unfortunately, at the time, I really believed in it, I spent a lot of energy essentially gaslighting myself, and every time a sale didn't go as anticipated, I beat myself up for not \"manifesting\" well enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "I mentioned earlier it was a MLM-y system, and that is further reinforced by Sue herself encouraging photographers to collaborate with MLMs such as MaryKay. Sure, you can gain clients that way, but I would never in a million years do that as I know how awful MLMs are. The fact that she endorses it was one of the first things that drove me away.\n",

            "You are expected to devote hours and hours of your time to watching Sue's videos, which contain so much esoteric and personal-life stuff that if you boiled it down to the relevant content you'd be left with less than half of it. She will lure you in by sharing personal details, being vulnerable, creating a community where you feel like you have value, and there is a strong us-vs-them mentality: those cheap shoot&amp;burners that are ruining the industry blah blah versus us, the portrait artists, who create real value and run a real business - when in reality it just isn't that clear cut. You are also supposed to do EXACTLY as she tells you, down to the specific products she uses, and she offers sales scripts for you to learn by heart. If you deviate, you will get criticized. All of this, in my opinion, is really culty. Also, if there's 10 photographers in your city offering the exact same thing, why would anyone come to you in particular? It robs you of any individuality.\n",

            "First a bit of a backstory - I started to take photography serious around 2010, although I been taking pictures before that but 2010 was more serious where I felt that there maybe something here that was enough to derail my interest in IT that I was going to school for, I mean I was even Cisco certified because I wanted to be a Network Engineer (I would have made lot more money than photography with that job! lol) but I felt with photography that I didn't feel with the IT stuff, I guess you can call it joy. It made me get outside and enjoy nature and the sights that I just ignored because I was looking at computer screens all the time. It eventually even got me interested in hiking and exercising which caused me to lose 150 pounds and because of photography, I am a much healthier person today than I was when I worked on computers - Photography saved my life and I'm happy about that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Back in 2010 social media wasn't really as big as it is now, in high school the only social media we had was MySpace, I used it until I started to get hate and threats on there and I shut that shit right down, I despise cyberbullying. So I didn't really use social media until around 2016 (when I happened to get my first smartphone, yeah I'm late to the game), I did have a Twitter account in high school that I used to keep up to date on a lot of tech things but recently I decided to delete my account because I don't like the way Twitter was going, especially with photography and silly NFTs.\n",
            "\n",
            "I joined Instagram - I didn't know what I was in for. Shared photos and got lots of likes on my photos and boy did that feel good, something I didn't really experience before. I wanted more likes, more followers and I kept that up for a while until I lost it one day when I shared a photo I loved but it hardly got any likes. I got so upset over it that I smashed my phone (something I regret doing). I ended up deleting my Instagram account and stayed off of it for a while but I had that need for validation that I so desperately wanted so I started to use Twitter, Flickr and even Facebook in the same way and I also kind of ruined those for myself, even Flickr. Yeah its basically dead these day, but I still today find myself seeking \"favorites\", I'll even try to optimize my posts for maximum reach via tags and groups. Its pathetic. When I was using Instagram, I stopped using Flickr for a good 2 years because well Instagram was everything, I spent all my time there.\n",

            "Eventually I created a new Instagram account which is what I use today but I haven't logged in for well over two months now. But before I stepped away from Instagram, I noticed I was being heavily influenced by other photographers on Instagram, I was taking pictures that I knew would get likes and get upset when they didn't and would to start thinking that I sucked. When a photo got lots of likes, I felt happy and felt like I was going in a good direction with my photography but the bad days on Instagram kept getting more and more and more and it was really having an affect on my mental health because man I was so addicted to the validation and the fear of losing followers. I was spending 5-8 hours a a day on the app! Granted it was probably all due to the shitty algorithm but I legitimately thought it was because of my photos even when others told me it wasn't - I didn't believe them. I knew something was wrong with me so I had to step away and I haven't been back yet. I'm not sure when I'll log back in but only when I feel ready, I do miss my friends though.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I been avoiding a lot of social media lately (except Reddit apparently) and I'm trying to learn again to take photos for myself but its not going well and I feel like giving up and selling my gear because I don't know if I enjoy photography anymore. I feel confused, lost. Social media or I guess I should say \"Instagram\" has got the wires crossed in my brain that I can't even enjoy my own work anymore. \n",
            "\n",
            "Even though I think I'm a failure, I also know that I am not. I've had plenty of success too. I've sold 30 prints, made enough to buy a new camera/lens and I've had photos win in competitions and be on the front cover of a newspaper and yet I don't feel like I deserve any of it because I don't know if I am doing it for myself or for the validation.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should say that I do struggle with anxiety, self esteem and confidence issues which I am trying to work on these things and I know some of that might not be helping this situation very well.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know every photographer reaches some sort of low point in their journey and I'm starting to believe this is my low point. I don't want to give up, I don't like giving up anything so I need to keep trying to find my way back to where I can enjoy photography again and be happy with my work\n",

            "Anyways, I just wanted to talk a little about what's on my mind and for anyone who is reading this who is struggling with something similar due to social media sucking the joy out photography just know its okay and you're not alone.\n",
            "I'm guessing it has something to do with how our visual system works but when I'm out and about looking for shots it's almost always the case that the best shots I end up getting are some innocuous thing I catch out of the corner of my eye and not the main thing I might think to focus on. \n",
            "\n",
            "Likewise I find it incredibly important to not get too caught up in needing to get a particular shot right or planning too much for a shot in my head cause I almost always find that the shots I think are going to work out really don't and the ones that do are again something random I catch while looking for other things.\n",
            "So I've been in a few contests over the last year or so. I've never won (Yes I'm a little salty lol). All of the contests have been for \"Amateurs\" because that's what I am. The discouraging thing about all of it is the fact of the term amateur not being outlined or distinguished in any way other then you can't have had your photo published in any professional works i.e. a magazine or gallery. So the problem is the gap between people like me who owns maybe $2000 worth of equipment and travel locally are going up against people who have $20,000 of equipment and have traveled to 20 deferent countries. I just wondered if anyone else felt this way, what could be done to help all of us out and is there such a thing as being able to buy your way to a good photo. I'm not doubting these photographers skills, they are good and sometimes down right amazing. But most of us can't afford to visit big cultural events around the world or spend 3 months traveling to have the opportunity to capture these photos\n",

            "A few days later I got a message on Instagram from the photographer introducing herself. She asked for us to use her for photography work for our business and to compensate her for the photo, otherwise to take the photo down.

            "I feel like I've seen a bit of discourse about this general topic (not necessarily on this Reddit, sort of just floating around the internet in general), as in, if camera photography is \"real\" photography, and that you aren't really shooting if you're using a phone camera. I was wondering what the opinion here is; does time shooting with phone cameras count as shooting experience? Or do you only really grow as a photographer when you pick up an actual camera? In my opinion, it depends on how intentional you are with the phone camera; are you doing any editing (not that editing is quintessential to being a good photographer, just an example however of what many photographers usually do to demonstrate dedication/desire for a better end product), are you putting effort into making good compositions/getting specifically good shots, etc.? I've found that some people can have actual cameras and their pictures can still turn out mediocre, but I believe it's more a matter of the artist than their medium.\n",

            "Hey all, so a little back story. I've been a Nikon shooter since the Nikon D7100 came out. I've had multiple mirrorless Nikon cameras, and currently have a Z6ii and Z7ii. The delay in updates for these cameras has pissed me off, and I'm also annoyed that if I want a good f2.8 zoom, I need to shell out $3000CAD because there are no 3rd party Z mount options, and I don't know if any are coming anytime soon.\n",
            "\n",
            "With this in mind I had 2 options as I want to stick with full frame. Canon or Sony. Canon charges too much for the r6 (in my opinion, I know it's a solid performer, but no BSI sensor, less MP, worse entry level RF lens selection, and I hate the location of the front dial) and no way am I going to downgrade my Z6ii MP but pay $500CAD more. So that left with me with the Sony a7iv. Other than the 4k60 crop, it checked all the other boxes on paper. I know the Sony IBIS sucks for video, but who tries to shoot anything remotely serious handheld, my DJI takes care of the video IBIS issue. Anyways, I mentioned this and a couple people asked me to do a comparison post, so here we go.\n",
            "\n",

            "# Pros of the Sony a7iv\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **33MP sensor**. This would really allow for me to get my setup down to 1 camera. I love the Z6ii to just carry around everywhere because it's cheaper (in comparison to the Z7ii, I know none of these cameras are cheap), but love the resolution of the Z7ii for paid work, the 33MP is almost right in the middle and I feel good enough to do it all.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Battery life seems better**. I imagine I'll have no issue hitting 1k shots on this camera. I've already fired off about 250 and used 10% battery life. I haven't changed any power settings, brightness etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Lighter and smaller**. It's not a massive difference, but it feels like it is in hand. I'm not sure if it's the new a7iv body, but it feels like the weight is more balanced in the hand. The a7iii was shit for this. I do not know if this will be good for larger zooms due to weight distribution, but for primes it's solid.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **I really love the rear dial for ISO**. I know it's something simple, but on the Nikons you need to hold a button and then turn the rear dial to change ISO. On this, you can customize the rear dial to do it and it's solid because my thumb is always near there to activate eye AF at any point in time.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Speaking of AF, it's quite good**. I'm only using the shitty kit lens that comes with the camera but it's quick and accurate. I don't find the eye pick up distance any different than the Z6ii but it is more stuck to the eye and not bouncing all over. I also love that eye AF works in single point mode, where as Nikon you need to select wide human eye AF, or auto etc. Another nice part is if you're focusing on something else with single point and you want to quickly lock on to someones eye in the background, you press one button and it's focus on the eye. Really nicely done. I do find that unless your subject is jumping around like an idiot, sprinting towards the camera, or it's low light, that the eye AF is equally as accurate. I do not find the low light AF speed to be much better than the Z6ii and single point is just as accurate and fast on both. I am using the shitty kit lens with the a7iv, and also using the 24-70 F4 kit lens on the Z6ii for comparison, but the Nikon kit lens is actually worth keeping.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Better button customization**. This one caught me by surprise because I know the old Sony interface was trash. This one one is good, still very in depth, but good. My favourite part is that there are no limitations to what you can bind to the buttons. With Nikon, for some reason, you cannot bind certain things to certain buttons, but you can to others. It makes 0 fucking sense and Sony lets you bind pretty much everything to anything.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Lens selection**. This one is obvious. The Z lenses are fantastic, the IQ is top quality, but with almost 0 quality 3rd party glass out there, to get into the nice zooms and faster than f1.8 glass, is going to cost you some organs. With nothing other than Viltrox as an alternative (which they aren't for anyone trying to do something semi-professionally) it can be rough. I'd love to grab the 24-70 f2.8s, but $3000CAD is steep for someone who does photography as a side job. Where as with Sony, you have 3rd party alternatives like Tamron and Sigma that rival the image quality, if not even surpass, the G Master line. From what I understand, the Tamron 28-75 G2 and the Sigma 24-70 F2.8 Art are just as good and fast as the G Master version, but cost 1/3rd.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Misc QOL things**. I really hate the I/O covers on the Nikons, they just don't feel all that well attached to the camera. I also hate  that the memory card door doesn't have a lock on it. There are so many times where I've gone to grab my camera out of my bag and I've pulled the memory card door open by accident. Lucky it hasn't ever gotten caught or ripped off because it is just held on with a couple plastic clips. Sony has really nailed this. Their IO covers have nice hinges and are really thick, solid, tight (lol) material. The memory card cover has a lock that you need to not only slide it down, but forward to open.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **EVF position for glasses wearers**. Now, apparently according to tech specs, the the Nikon has a bigger EVF, BUT, the way it is positioned makes it so you have a hard time seeing every edge of the screen with glasses. I think it's because it's kinda sunk in further. Where as the Sony, even if slightly smaller over all, is positioned better and I can see everything, even the giant as fuck exposure bar across the bottom. Also, the EVF is 120hz, which beats the Nikon 60hz and it is noticeable.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Shutter speed sound**. I KNOW this is a stupid reason to want a different camera. But the Sony a7iv shutter sound is real nice. I also love mechanical keyboards, and my favourite switch is the Holy Panda. It has this deep thunk, but still crisp sound. And the a7iv shutter reminds me of this. It's a pleasing sound, not as pleasing as the Fujifilm X-T3 / X-T4, but still very good. The Nikon Z6ii and Z7ii shutter sounds like shit, I don't know how to describe it other than it sounds like scratchy and mushy. Maybe I'll do a recording with my mic and post so you can decide.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Edit: HERE are the shutter sounds. First is the Sony, second is Nikon.** [https://vocaroo.com/1lOKpI1yTnH1](https://vocaroo.com/1lOKpI1yTnH1)\n",

            "# Pros of the Nikon Z6ii\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Buffer size**. I don't know wtf is going on, but I was testing out a Sandisk Extreme Pro UHS1 SD card in both cameras. SAME CARD. The Nikon I could shoot 80 Lossless Compressed Raw + JPEG Extra Fine to it without issue. The Sony a7iv, was like 14. It cleared it pretty quickly, but it would 100% hit buffer. I know 33mp vs 24mp, BUT it shouldn't be 8x less. Yes, the Sony was in lossless raw as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **LCD Screen**. This is a big one. Sony has always been a dick when it comes to  their rear screen. It's honestly kind of a meme (look at the a1 screen for instance). The Nikon's screen is bigger (3.2in vs 3in), brighter, and over 2m dots. The a7iv is just over 1m dots and you can tell the difference. The flippy screen is whatever, I like that I can flip it towards the body and protect it, but I hate not being able to angle it behind the screen. Fujifilm has the best LCD articulation by far, and even now the Nikon Z9 has copied it.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Top LCD Screen**. Some people love it, but I don't give too much of a shit about it because it doesn't show exposure, and thus I can just flip up my rear screen to see what everything is set at, so what do I care. The only time I've found it extremely useful is when doing astrophotography, because you can adjust your settings without blinding yourself in the middle of a dark field with your giant 3.2\" LCD screen. I also think Sony could have snuck a small one on the left side of the a7iv.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Higher quality glass for the price point**. There is no doubt that the Nikon Z glass is top tier. The f1.8 glass punches above it's price point, in my opinion, and has some great stuff built in (like the 35mm has anti focus breathing built in to the lens, makes it fantastic for video). Yes, it costs more than the Sony f1.8 stuff, but they aren't even in the same ball park, it's not even the same game. The Nikon glass is SUPERIOR, there's just not much of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **IBIS**. So Sony's IBIS is held back because the E mount was originally a crop sensor mount, and they shoe horned this big ass FF sensor in it. When you look at the mount, you can easily see that the edges of the FF sensor are being clipped by the mount. This means that the IBIS mech can't really make any decently large adjustments. The only option that Sony has is a digital stabilization, which crops your video, and if you're shooting 4k60, you're cropping for the video, then cropping more for the stabilization, and if you have on the focus breathing compensation, you're cropping even more. Cropping sucks, sure you're sampling from the 7k sensor, but still, it sucks. The Nikon however, has this gigantic mount with lots of room for the sensor to move around. It has great stabilization for stills and pretty good stabilization for hand held. A gimbal is needed for Sony video, but you can definitely make things work hand held with a Nikon. On top of that, Sony does NOT lock the IBIS mech when you shut  the camera off. If you shut off a Sony camera and move it around, you can hear little clunks and that's the IBIS mech moving. Nikon locks their mech so it doesn't move at all and that just makes me feel a lot safer when rucking it up some mountain somewhere.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Less heat**. This is pretty straight forward, the Nikon stays cool and the body doesn't get warm. The Sony a7iv body gets warm, even when just shooting stills.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **CFExpress Type B is superior**. I don't know why Sony wanted to go with the CFExpress Type A. Maybe because it's smaller and you can use the same slot as an SD card slot too, but Type A sucks. It's slower, less storage, and it costs more. For instance, my Nikon has a 512GB CFExpress from Angelbird. I paid $260CAD with shipping and tax. It is faster than any Types A card, and 160gb costs you like $500CAD.\n",
            "\n",
            "\\- **Some QOL / random stuff**. I like having a locking Diopter, and a locking mode dial. The Sony has neither. They have a locking wheel, but not the one that I feel really matters. The Nikon, you click the button, turn it to whatever mode you want, click it again, and you don't have to worry about accidentally moving it to one of your user customized options. With the diopter, you pull it away from the camera, it unlocks, set it, and push it back in. Much like setting the time on an analog watch. I also prefer that the Nikon has a rubber grip on both the left side and the right side of the body. The Sony only has the rubberized grip on the hand grip, the memory card cover and where you thumb rests on the back.\n",
            "\n",
            "&amp;#x200B;\n",
            "\n",
            "Alright, so that's what I've got comparing the two during my couple days of having the a7iv on hand with the shitty kit lens. I know it was long, but I warned you. Maybe a video would be easier so maybe I'll film the final conclusion. I'm hoping to get my hands on a 24-70 f2.8 zoom or the 35mm f1.4 Gmaster to give this camera a bit better of a test. The kit lens still auto focuses pretty quick, and is decently sharp. I just know that I'm sure there is better performance to be had with better lenses. The Nikon Z lenses are all kinda top tier, so I know this $200CAD kit lens can't compare.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Also, I highly recommend NO ONE do the shutter to protect sensor shut down option. That is a fucking horrible idea and I have no clue why this was implemented. I don't know if anyone has ever actually touched or held a shutter blade, but they are paper thin and easily damaged. I'd hate to be swapping my lens out and some dust (see edit) flies and get stuck in the shutter blades and when you take a picture it bends one. Even using a rocket blower can potentially damage one of the blades. The sensor is protected by a piece of pretty strong glass, so there's no risk of damaging it when rocket blowing it to get dust off.**\n",

            "**SHUTTER BLADE EDIT: Ok, so I wrote this late and I typed dust but I should have typed dirt, or debris in the air, pieces of wood in the wind, someone chubby curious fingers. So no, a couple small flakes of dust will not ruin your shutter blades, BUT they are still fragile. In a safer setting like a studio, this setting is going to be fine unless you have some morbid curiosity about what those cool blades feel like, but I personally wouldn't risk it out in the field. The blades overlap and if something does get stuck between the blades it can cause issues. Have you ever just been walking outside and something lands in your eye and you're out there pulling your eye skin to the side blinking like crazy to get it out. I'd rather not risk that situation with the shutter blades. I think that over time we will see an actual cover get implemented if space permits. I will stick with a rocket blower and a spot healing tool in Lightroom over potentially damaging the shutter blades on a $3500CAD camera. If the blades feel like the ones on a Nikon FE2, they do feel pretty sweet, but don't touch them.**\n",

There also isn't much in the way of available equipment, so it's not like I can impart any practical skills like darkroom techniques or studio lighting. I never did A level art, only at postgraduate level (where the work is a lot more conceptual and research based), so I'd like any advice on good ways to structure an art lesson, especially one that is one-to-one.

You could charge a reasonable price for the students and fill your day enough to make it worth your time. Hell, maybe even the med school would foot the bill (unlikely, but it's not out of the question).

([I shot a photo series of the place during COVID without any people](https://www.albertdros.com/post/the-most-beautiful-flower-garden-in-the-world-without-people)). The tulip fields around this place were exploding with people in recent years. Unfortunately, many tulip growers had to take action and put fences around their fields and actively protect them from tourists 'destroying' their fields. The sad truth is that there are lot of people (definitely not everyone) that have no respect for the tulip fields, stand on the flowers while taking selfies, and even take the flowers from the fields. I would normally end my article with this, but I feel it deserves extra attention today: Respect the growers fields!\n",

            "\\- ***Use the obvious leading lines***: The easiest way is to just use the leading lines of the tulips in your composition. These images always work well and are very simple to photograph. Make sure you turn on the grid on your camera. This way, you make sure that the lines are perfectly going tho the exactly middle of the image.\n",

            "\n",

It takes some time to find 'the perfect tulip' on the foreground, but it can be very rewarding when you do. With this technique, your image will look very 3D. You get so close to the tulip on the foreground, that you can't get everything in focus. Basically, you're near your maximum focus distance of your lens. If you can't get both the foreground and background in focus, you can use a technique called 'focus stacking'. With this, you take a photo of the foreground, mid-ground, and background, and merge them together in postprocessing to get a sharp photo from front to back. Note that this technique can only be done with basically no wind. I also teach this postprocessing technique in my [editing course](http://www.edityourlandscapes.com/).\n",

I sometimes even use 400mm and get quite far away. This way you can take a super dreamy image of a single tulip. Of course, you can also use a macro lens. **Fun fact**: While the the tulips that stand are beautiful, they are are usually 'sick' .

They also often slightly change, as it's difficult the grow the same flower on the same field for multiple years in a row.

            "Hello everyone! I come to you with a question that has always confused me. Coming from a photographers POV, I have lately been uninspired with my photos and dissatisfied with any current as well as my past work. From my own \"research\" I have come across the idea that I should be looking at famous photography and paintings with the goal of understanding why I like them. I should be looking at the art and analyzing why I like these specific pieces. But what does that actually mean?\n",

[In this podcast episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3BQG0aSJFc4mem4QJAhrk0?si=b6c2902710994f25)(around the 50:50 mark), Roger's son mentions how he started photography and was unsatisfied, but after looking at other's work, he saw how they used different compositional techniques and he took what he liked from their work to improve his own.\n",

How do you look at a piece of art, understand why you like it, whether it is the style of light, composition techniques(leading lines, rule of thirds), or that it's just a good photograph/painting with a good subject? How do you extract what makes that piece of art speak to you, what makes it \"work\" and put it into use in your own photography/artistic process?\n",
            "How do you all deal with clients that you just want to say \"no\" to? My wife is JUST starting out and she had someone contact her on Saturday morning. She said her photographer was sick and she needed a headshot ready for a sign by Monday morning. My wife had shoots already booked on Saturday and Sunday plus our children's activities that she hoped to attend. She was moving things around and trying to be flexible. Her price for a headshot session is $100 (which is below average for our area). She told her initially of her price (like the first message back to her), after settling on a time for the shoot, the potential client asked if the price was \"flexible\".  We had to talk my wife down from either ditching this person or doubling her price at that point. :) How do you (or would you) deal with this situation? I think she handled it well and everyone was happy in the end. (text thread in comments)\n",

I have fought this for over a week with no results. I’ve tried every thing I can find on the internet and YouTube. All my devices will connect to my extender but my PS4 will not. It will connect to my router that is one room away but not to the extender that is in the same room as my PS4.

            "I've had my ps4 for about 6 years now and it hasn't run into any major problems until now. About a year ago I was playing when suddenly the ps4 ejected the disc by itself. I shrug it off as just a weird thing that happened except it kept ejecting discs for no reason. So I watched a video which told me to take the rubber foot off the bottom, which I did. This solved the problem immediately and I thought that was that. However my ps4 also started experiencing another problem which was shutting down randomly. It would beep randomly, and then the ps4 just shut off completely as if someone pulled the plug. I know it isn't overheating because just yesterday I was literally on the home menu not even doing anything when it just shut off randomly. And to make it worse my ps4 is now randomly ejecting discs again. Again, I know it's not overheating because it just does it when I'm not even doing anything, and I clean my ps4 quite regularly sooooo yea. \n",

It rekindles this love that I’ve always had as a kid but somewhere along my path of growing up it was suppressed by family and friends. I still played video games but felt weird about expressing how I felt about the story of certain games, their characters and the world created in them. Now for some reason at the age of 30 I have finally gotten over that (maybe subconscious I’m not sure) thought/feeling of, “I shouldn’t love video games that way and stop being lazy” feeling and have fully embraced my love for them.\n",

            "Okay so here's a little context. I recently started getting some pretty serious stick drift on my one working controller so I went to the store to pick up a new one. I got home, opened it up, turned it on and plugged it in and it worked fine. The next day I tried turning on my controller and I got nothing, the light didnt go on, the reset button didnt work etc. it was dead dead. I didnt have the recipt bc I'm a dumbass and got rid of it asap so I counted it as a loss and went on with using the drifting controller for a few months, I had little ways of fixing it (turning it upside down and giving the sticks a wiggle, using a pin to clear out debris) and it was useable for the most part. Well yesterday I decided I was sick of the drift and decided to transfer over the battery from the drifty one to the new one in hopes that I could use it again. Long story short it worked, I turned it on, no drift no problems, basically a brand new controller. 5 mins later I took it home (fixed it at my parents bc they have the tools I need) and when I got home the controller didnt turn on. Again. I couldn't plug it in, I couldn't press the reset, nothing worked. Now I have no controllers that work and I'm very frustrated that my ps4 controller is frying all my batteries. I dont really know what to do other than go buy a new one and I was mostly just going on here to rant lmao but if any of yall have ideas please send them my way.\n",

            "I’m not sure how to frame this or if it’s ever happened to anyone else. I got a notice on my PlayStation saying that I was permanently banned from the network for violating community rules. I couldn’t log on I was blocked. I found the error code and it regarded chargebacks and the reversal of charges for bundle purchases I’d made. I checked with my financial institution that I used and they said all the payments were processed for the purchases and weren’t charged back. I emailed PlayStation Network and explained this. They send a email basically reiterating that I charged back the purchases and gave me a balance I had to pay. I had to purchase PlayStation store credits from a store and enter the codes. I buy a card for more than the amount owed by $5.00. Later I received an email from them saying the card had insufficient funds to lift the ban and gives me another balance to pay that was $6.00 less than the original balance owed. Next time I buy a $50.00 card submit the code. After about 6 hours or so I received another email explaining the ban had been lifted. So after paying $75.00 on a $50.00 charge the ban was lifted but the strange part is I check my transactions made and only the bundle purchases and the $25.00 card store cash payment are shown in transactions and not the other $50.00 card I purchased. Nor was there any balance for overpayment. Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else on the PlayStation Network?\n",

Caenis was an incredibly beautiful woman from Thessaly, even compared to goddesses, which meant she had a lot of suitors she turned down. Then one day, Poseidon noticed her, and in the typical assholish fashion of Greek gods, didn’t take no for an answer. And after the act, he offered to grant her any wish she might have. To which Caenis replied: “Make a man, so that I never suffe this fate again.”. To which Poseidon agreed, and on top of it granted her an impenetrable skin no weapon could harm. Caenis became Caeneus and went on to become a warrior and a king who died in a war against the centaurs, who realizing they couldn’t harm him with their weapons, piled tree trunks and boulders on top of him to bury him alive. Later tales made him part of the argonauts or father of one of them, a participant in the Calydonian Boar hunt, told that after death s/he became a golden bird, and in the Eneide he was seen in Hades (the world of the dead, not the god) as Caenis again, because his soul was originally female.\n",

The character is one of my favorites because of its complexity, s/he is crass, rude and violent (Neutral Evil as alignment), with a “bully big brother” attitude worthy of Darius and an ego associated with his/her pseudo-divinity that would make Qiyana nod, but at the same time s/he realizes that all his/her power comes from Poseidon and thus the trauma it accompanies, and because of being a woman in body (~~because it sells better cough~~) it’s having him/her being extremely conflicted about his/her identity, with a very strong traumatic dissociation between who she was before Poseidon’s abduction and after he has been transformed. The whole thing is treated in game as the touchy and complex subject it is (down to having him/her having “Undetermined” gender in game because technically, both are true), and I’m grateful for that.

In teamfight, Caenis’ ideal plan of attack is to use W to charge in, Ultimate to control everything around, potentially reactivating the passive if already downed, then using Q to go for the kill, with E either to clear CC so that Ultimate can be used, or to reactivate the passive a 2nd or 3rd time (if Ultimate already recharged it) to last longer.

            "This item is bought just to KS kills. Although I hate this word but this item is just made for that. The theory around this item is that the adc is the main carry of the game and adc's buy it so that in team fights or skirmishes they guarantee that they take the kills and avoid any potential misplay of the kill going to the support or the tank in the team. \n",

I had a game like this few weeks ago where I was playing viego and I was pretty ahead until my adc (sivir) bought the item and took every kill in team fights with one Q. The problem here is that she wasn't offering any value and she was super squishy so she died fast and we started losing since all the team gold was on her. On the other part I was ahead as viego and I knew I can carry this game and become unkillable if I could get that gold. Unfortunately that item put me so behind as the jungler and I became squishy compared to the enemy jungler while our sivir is full build. At this case you become forced to buy a collector yourself to counter hers or put your faith in the adc and hope they can carry.\n",

Should I still consider playing the OG game, or perhaps the spin-off games and other installments, maybe get interested in the other media (that being Arcane and the comic books), etc.?
