            "After a long day of work at the amazon warehouse, pissing and shitting your diaper because you get fired for taking bathroom breaks, seriously injuring yourself but continuing work anyways, barely sleeping 4 hours every night, you go home and start weeping. You spend all day, every day slaving away under Jeff Bezos's hellish reign, but still make below the minimum wage. The tears accelerate. You think about the fact that 1 million people have to suffer this fate. You think about your bleak future. Life is torture, and the only way out causes more suffering for your friends and relatives. The tears accelerate. You are crying a worrying amount of tears. Your eyes start to hurt, which only makes you cry more. Your mom knocks on your door, concerned. She asks if you are okay. This reminds you of the fact that you still live with your mother because you couldn't afford even the cheapest, shittiest house ever made. The tears accelerate. You try to answer your mother, but your throat closes up. The last thing you see clearly before the waterfall of tears blur your sight beyond being able to see anything is your mother's horrified expression as she sees her child spewing a waterfall of bloody tears out of their eyes. The tears accelerate. You can no longer shut your eyelids. Your eyes are in excruciating pain. You struggle to keep your head from being pushed back by the tears. You don't know why this is happening. Everything in your room is soaked in tears. The tears accelerate. It hurts so much. Everything is red. around 10% of your tears are made of blood. Your neck hurts so much. You hear the ambulance outside and think of how terrible the healthcare is in your country. Your eyelids are ripped apart by the torrent of bloody tears. The excruciating physical pain in your eyes, neck and eyelids combined with the existential dread you feel thinking about the sins of mankind and the suffering felt by people who didn't deserve it makes the tears accelerate even more. You wonder how you are even still alive with how much blood you have lost. A few people die after being ripped apart by the giant tsunami of blood and tears. You look the other way to try to avoid fucking killing anyone. This fails. You are pushed back at mach speed, taking out two policemen, showering you in blood and organs. You slam into a wall head-first and break your spine, skull, shoulders and ribcage. You should be dead by now, but you somehow survive. You are paralyzed from the neck down and are powerless to stop your ascent. Your eyeballs disintegrate. The tears accelerate. You spin extremely fast. Almost all of your blood goes to your feet and they burst open. Your skull shatters and your tears are spewed out in a large cone. The tears accelerate. Most of your body is destroyed as the tears spew in a wider and wider angle. You become a bloody, tear-stained pulp violently spewing tears in every direction. Buildings are leveled. Thousands die. People flee the country to avoid the explosion of bloody tears. People start getting on boats to survive, but nothing can save them from your wrath. Sea levels rise 7%. The tears accelerate. Earthquakes. Tsunamis. Floods. The sky turns red with blood. Israel, Iceland, Syria and the Philippines are all gone. Many, many millions die. The tears accelerate. All hope is lost for humanity. Your warm mixture of blood and tears melts a large portion of the south pole. Another country disappears below sea level. And another. And another. And another. Billions die. The tears accelerate. As all ice on earth melts, the planet is flooded.\n",

            "For some reason I e been getting a lot of hate on this group,I e been called \"creepy\" and a \"liar\" because of the stories I share. First I want to say, the stories I share are very true, I'm not bragging when I say that I e been blessed to have gotten to experience a lot of awesome foot fetish experiences. I just want to share my stories with you and I get called a liar and creepy. All the women that I talk about in my stories always felt comfortable around me and they were my friends/future girlfriends at the Time and I always just call them by their first initial in my retellings out of respect for their privacy. Yes I'm very bold with my foot fetish but none of the women I've had experiences with have ever felt uncomfortable or creeped out by me, if they did I wouldn't be sharing these stories. It's fine if you don't believe me but calling me creepy just because I'm bold? Is that really necessary? I thought the foot fetish community was a place where you can be open and honest about your love of feet and share some amazing experiences you've had. But so far in this group I've just gotten a lot of unnecessary hate and it needs to stop. I'm here because I love women's feet and I want to share my experiences that I've had. Why am I getting hate?

            "Basically, things the average developer in Blizzard expects and us wondering why. I rest my case. In game voice not being capitalized leading to the incursion and setting them up as voice channels only as to why the concept of a lore following a pantheon who’s fall echoed throughout the solar system, not noticing these things by talent being wasted with our own money while we sit here and watch our lives dwindle away after being charged a monthly basis and trying to reason with us why it’s justified, not attributing the gains they incurred by using blizzard updates as ways to avoid setbacks for the lackluster of employees that shouldn’t even be working there and us inheriting these problems and not thinking microsoft would be incurring the wrath as to wondering why the stocks fall revealing further bias by not being prepared on how to remedy these problems and relying on beings such as the community council to faulter out of spite and not acting on things enabling a theory of conspiracy when in reality there’s things you do and things you don’t do and knowing the things you can do to better the world is noticing how the world actually works without glorifying these things as a newfound knowledge and wondering why we don’t rely on the news to know why bad things happen when in it spreads corruption by valuing these things as opinions when in fact that once upon a time our opinions were heard by developers and we blame the company for imploring them. Case in point if you don’t have the ability to admire simplicity then you create more problems then by trying to fixing them and having higher staff members in the company punish you for it. doubting for those in the seat of power enable negligence and they think things like improving the lore is a great idea and wondering why would we care. It’s the people that make the game by enjoying it not by doing it I highly recommend that you they should not take the bias approach to undermine the values of those they deem lesser to themselves without having any idea why they would take our word for it. It’s pointless… just don’t think you can say your life has no meaning because of the the mindset, because if you can do that then you know exactly what comes next without attributing the things that are currently going on legally and using it to actually get out in the world when there really is no need to please anyone whatsoever and us wondering how full our pockets really can be. Things they can simply do without raising toxicity and regarding those around superior by not understanding the premise of equality when our society is based on quality and not quantity. Don’t reside on the collective without first spreading the word which is how a company is supposed to be run and how you carry yourself reflects and effects those around you without determining if they are alone in as to why they need to appreciate themselves without being acknowledged after the current legal battle. Don’t merit those for doing what they were supposed to be doing for this because in reality it makes you an enabler for you to get away with things nobody needed in the first place.  \n",

I love the shape of it, the feel of it and the sweet sweet taste of precum! I love hearing my partner’s moans as I make love to his dick with my mouth, tongue and hands. I use it as a wordless medium to communicate to him how much I’m attracted to him and how I’ll be his little slut any fucking day. I usually fall into this sweet trance while doing it and for a while, it feels like time stops as I pour my heart out onto his cock. It’s a form of expression for me.\n",

Normally I am all about fart etiquette (fartiquette) and I will get up and move to a different location to fart and spare the people around me the agony. I got lazy and figured what he doesn't know won't hurt him... I just let out another one before the end of this post.

I’ve had some time to reflect on that and decided to educate you on a few facts regarding this flight attendant.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, let’s review my training and requirements for this job. I know how to fight fires while 35,00 feet in the air; I can perform CPR, do first-aid - basic, all the way up to inserting an IV; I know how to identify guns and weapons; I know how to identify bombs and then move them to a location on the aircraft that will hopefully cause the least damage should they go off.\n",
            "\n",
            " I know basic survival skills for land and water; I know how to disarm people brandishing a gun; how to actually kill someone if need be; how to prepare an aeroplane for an emergency landing so every person aboard has the best chance of survival, and how to then evacuate the aircraft in under 60 seconds.\n",
            "\n",
            "While smiling, I have been taught how to deal with people from many different cultures, people who are disgruntled, and people who are downright rude. I received excellent training for all these things and every year have to go through refresher training and learn new skills.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, I’d like to share with you some of the personal experiences I’ve had in the last 20 years as a flight attendant. I’ve held the hand of a grieving mother who was flying across the country to claim her 21-year-old son’s dead body. I have given my personal clothes to a passenger who threw up, although I had nothing else to put on. I have been poked in my arm and sides many times by people who can’t wait for me to finish with one person before they get their drink.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have held babies while their parent went to the bathroom. I have been yelled at for not having the exact food a person wanted. I have prepared an aircraft for an emergency landing, and, while you were arguing with me about not wanting to turn off your computer, I was hoping I would be able to see my children one more time.\n",
            "\n",
            " I stood with tears in my eyes in the door of an aircraft while the remains of a US soldier were lowered in a flag-draped coffin. I have had the honour of flying US troops into foreign deployment areas. I missed Christmas Day with my family so you could get to your family. My work schedule is constantly changing, and there are times I go five to six days without a real night’s sleep.\n",
            "\n",
            "I watched the events of 9/11 in horror, heartbroken from what my colleagues went through that day. I was scared to go back to work, but I reassured my child that I would come home — all the while knowing it could happen again. I watched a man die in front of me, because the CPR we performed didn’t revive him. Then I tried to reverently place his body on the aeroplane floor for the remainder of the flight, and, when we landed, I sat with his body for over an hour until the coroner could pick it up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Please know that I do love my job, and I choose to do it. I have a college degree, am a mother, a grandmother, a friend, a human being. So the next time you look at me and think, ‘Just a flight attendant’, I hope you quickly remember who is trained and willing to get you out of a crashed aeroplane, save you from hijackers, perform CPR on you if need be and — the easiest part of my job — give you food and drinks.\n",
            "Please put an NSFW tag on this. I was on the train and when I saw this I had to start furiously masturbating. Everyone else gave me strange looks and were saying things like “what the fuck” and “call the police”. I dropped my phone and everyone around me saw this image. Now there is a whole train of men masturbating together at this one image. This is all your fault, you could have prevented this if you had just tagged this post NSFW.\n",

I didn’t find out about this until today, just now, when he got up and said he was going to go make some tuna fish sandwiches for his bath and asked if I wanted to make some and join him. Apparently this is a regular occurrence and he’s been doing it for years whenever he would take a bath or smoke a dab pen in the restroom before he moved out of his moms. I’m not like, upset? I guess I’m just posting here because it felt like a confession enough. I told him that if my food touches bathroom air or surfaces I’d lose my shit and we laughed about it so it’s not a deal breaker but god is it weird lmao\n",

What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or will ever produce, shot out so hard that it ripped my dick apart by my übernut accelerating to 7% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It punched right trough my wall, barely slowing down, before cutting trough a structural support beam in my building as it were a nuclear powered angle grinder. The shear weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused my building to collapse, and every female in the city to fall pregnant with my children. When the death toll was tallied, there were 33 deaths, 148 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble, I rest assured knowing every one of my sons will repeat this glorious act.\n",

He becomes a masked vigilante to collect souls for the devil, but one day he is sent to collect a beautiful woman's soul but he falls in love with her, so they run away and put a team together to rob a casino, only for one of the team turning out to be a mole and double crosses them.\n",

I was very excited, waiting for them to come, but they never did, and I got reminded that, due to this oppressive dreamphobic system, I had no friends. So there I was - alone, crying, eating pizza and masturbating to 'Minecraft Speedrunner VS 5 Hunters THE LAST MANHUNT', when I decided to invite Dream over. Shaking, I DM'd him 'Hey, do you want to come over and eat pizza with me?', but an entire 3 seconds had passed, and he still hadn't answered. I started crying more intensely, eating pizza more intensely, masturbating more intensely, I thought I was going insane, until finally, after the most excruciating 19 seconds of my life, He answered 'Sure bae, if by pizza you mean your ass😉'.\n",

'This pizza is in need of some cream cheese, don't you think?' He says, while grabbing my ass, twisting me around, and penetrating me deeply with his thick sausage. Meanwhile, more and more Dreams started crawling through my windows, roofs, and penetrating me through all holes of my body - mouth, ears, nostrils, etc. My body had more Dream penis than bones inside of it. It lasted for about an hour, the greatest hour of my life, and it had a proper ending - Dream filled my body with gallons and gallons of his cum, so much that my bloodstream got replaced with his Green love. 'This pizza sure was delicious!', they exclaimed, and, suddenly, they all vanished, leaving me laid on the floor, pouring out their Green juice through all holes of my body, and with a valuable, life-changing lesson - Who needs friends, when you have Daddy Dream?\n",

It was the weirdest thing; there were no words, but there was this immediate connection. We couldn't keep our eyes off each other and I just swam closer without even thinking.

I'd never done anything like that before and she wasn't stopping me so I just rolled with it. One thing lead to another and my swim-trunks were off and I was having sex with her blowhole right there in the ocean.

Additionally, the fact that men have achieved the technology to travel to one of the largest bodies in our solar system is not only impressive, but also requires more intelligence and ability than can be taught at your nursing school.

            "Some time before 1565 (it may have been as early as 1500), an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered in Borrowdale, Cumbria. The locals found that it was very useful for marking sheep. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. This is still the only large scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for \"lead ore\"). The black core of pencils is still referred to as lead, even though it never contained the element lead. \n",

            "The value of graphite was soon realized, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs. The mines were taken over by the Crown and guarded. When sufficient stocks of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required. Graphite had to be smuggled out for use in pencils. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of holder. Graphite sticks were at first wrapped in string or in sheepskin for stability. The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide, attracting the attention of artists all over the known world.\n",

The distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, has a pencil museum.\n",
            "The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremburg, Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, sulphur, and antimony.\n",
            "Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Italians first thought of wooden holders. In 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti created the first blueprints for the modern carpentry pencil to mark their carpentry pieces. Their version was instead a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. They did this at first by hollowing out a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the two halves then glued together–essentially the same method in use to this day.\n",
            "English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars. France was under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain and could not import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines – the only known source in the world for solid graphite. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon's army to change this. In 1795, NicholasJacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth of Kohl-l-Noh in 1790, remains in use.\n",
            "In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused \n",
            "\n",
            "American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729, and George Washington used a three-inch pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Territory in 1762. It is said that William Munroe, a cabinetmaker in Concord, Massachusetts made the first American wood pencils in 1812. This was not the only pencil-making occurring in Concord. Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar\n",

            "On 30 March 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. In 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for infringement. In 1875 the Supreme  Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid.\n",

In 1795 Nicholas Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods which were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied (the more clay, the harder the pencil, and the lighter the color of the mark). This method of making pencils is still used today.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, pencils are made industrially by mixing finely ground graphite and clay powders, adding water, forming long spaghetti-like strings, and firing them in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax which seeps into the tiny holes of the material, resulting in smoother writing. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to make something called a slate, and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole thing is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted.\n",

You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don’t want to go sievin’ through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes.

            "To start this post off I must say that I am very much Christian MAN and Jared Leto to me is the perfect embodiment of our lord and saviour JESUS CHRIST. To start off his performance in Suicide Squad (2016) He portrays a very different version of the joker where her portrays a very divergent citizen This parallels christs divergent ways from the jewish tradition to reinvent the religion into modern christianity. Jokers goal was to reinvent society. In the promotional material for suicide squad we can see that the Joker supports the confederate flag. The confederates are a religious party http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/cwsouth.htm#:\\~:text=The%20new%20Confederate%20Constitution%2C%20adopted,%E2%80%9CGod%20will%20avenge%E2%80%9D). according to this website. Our saviour Jared leto also has a striking resemblance to portraits of Jesus that were made when he was doing stuff. In Our lord and saviour Jared leto's most recent film Morbius (2020) he is a sickly man who is looking for a cure for humanity just like Jesus was looking to cure the world of sin which Morbius also does when he kills a boat of people. Morbius is also seen to drink blood in the film which Jesus encouraged people to do at the last supper. Since when a vampire bites people they want to drink blood too he is encouraging them to drink blood. Morbius is also shown to have fantastical powers many of which are similar to Jesus, One of these is flight since in the bible jesus is shown to rise up to heaven which implies that he flew up there Many people will be sent to burn in Hell such as u/[redacted] for his frankly disgusting remarks towards our lord and Saviour Jared Leto and will have to be punished for it.\n",

Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. \\[Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"\\] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.\n",

All historical records, music, art and genetics depicting females have been altered by the government. It is well known that everyone has an CIA agent. That would either mean that there are double the people in the world or that half the population works for the government. It is said that around half the population is female. Curious, right? Also how do you explain the fact that women live longer than men? They work for the government! Of course, you might think that there is real proof for their existence, but I can debunk all of it. Their voice is made by voice changers. Their body is made by soy present in the air. Of course, the biggest counterargument would be their genitals. But porn is a lie. Have you ever seen a woman naked? Me neither. If you have a wife or a girlfriend, you are lying. But just for the sake of argument let's say you do. You have been brai washed by the Liberal government. The only thing all politicians agree on is the fact that women are made up. The only other rational argument I can think of is where do kids come from. Hahaha, you have been brainwashed to think about \"birth\". Everyone knows kids come from orphanages and factories.

It felt like it was chosen for me and so when my dad told me to throw that fish back in the water, but I couldn’t do it, so I threw a rock in the water and pretended it was the fish and I shoved the fish down my trouser. The fish was not bigger than my dick when it’s hard, but it was in there and the fish got warm as we were going home, and I just remember I was getting a boner as I was going home, and my dad was speaking to me and I tried to shift the focus away from the warm fish because I could feel the fish kinda like shaking and dying on my dick. It was kinda giving me a uhm, not a blowjob but it just felt like it was, you know it was having its last moments on my dick and it felt really special to me even though it was weird. And I remember getting home, quickly going to my room and I lied down and got naked. I remember taking my zip down and I saw the fish covered in cum. That one moment just felt amazing to me. And it was still kinda shaking like its nerves were going off, and it just felt so good. And I remember I didn’t want to let that fish go, I couldn’t let it go, because I felt like I was responsible for the fish and so I cleaned up all the cum and I cleaned up myself and I kept it in a freezer in my room. Whenever I would get horny and stuff, I’d use the fish to masturbate, and I would cum all over it again and again and again until the fish was smelling up the house and my dad knew something was going on with me. He could tell from the smell that something was in my mini-fridge, and he found the fish. I remember making up excuses, telling him “It’s not my fish, my friend gave it to me as a prank”. My dad was looking at me with disgust and I had to get rid of the fish which was obviously sad. And it affects me because I can’t speak to my dad without thinking about the fish. What’s even worse is that I can’t jack off without thinking about the fish. Porn doesn’t do it for me anymore. There’s no fish related stuff, no nothing. I don’t like fish as a food that much. I prefer medium-rare steak. Whenever I jack off I kinda feel the fish. I’ll never forget the feeling of it dying on my dick while I cummed on it.\n",

            "The Mega Knight card is unlocked from Royal Arena (Arena 7) or a Legendary Chest. He is a melee-ranged splash damage troop with very high hitpoints and moderate splash damage. He appears with black spiked fists and huge armor, along with grey chainmail and a team-colored belt. When deployed, he will deal damage around enemy units around him in a 360º area around him, which deals twice the amount of damage as his regular attack. If there are ground units between 3.5 and 5 tiles of him, he will stop moving and begin charging a jump attack which takes a few seconds. The damage and area from the jump is identical to his spawn damage. However, he's still vulnerable mid-air while jumping, and unlike a mid-air Hog Rider, cards like X-Bow will remain locked on to him. A Mega Knight card costs 7 Elixir to deploy.\n",

            "His spawn damage is similar to a Fireball, which makes him useful for quickly defeating cards with similar health to a Musketeer or Wizard. He will then only require 1 more regular attack to defeat them fully. However, the Night Witch, Witch, and Bandit have slightly more health than these units, so he will require a second swing to finish them off.\n",
            "\n",
            "When using him to counter a reactive pack of Royal Recruits, be careful for the other side of the Recruits approaching.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Mega Knight's high spawn damage and very high hitpoints make him nearly impossible to defeat on the opposing side, especially in lower arenas. He can get enormous value against massive pushes because of this. However, he can be countered relatively easily if alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Mega Knight works well with the Inferno Dragon, as they compliment each other's weakness. Mega Knight can take out ranged glass weapons and swarms that counter the Inferno Dragon. The Inferno Dragon in turn can sear tanks Mega Knight would struggle to deal enough damage to. However, it can be somewhat countered by air swarms so be sure to bring spells to deal with them.\n",
            "\n",
            "A similar strategy is to combine Mega Knight &amp; P.E.K.K.A. in a push, as they also counter each other’s weaknesses. While it can be more threatening, it is extremely expensive at 14 Elixir, often requiring that 1 of them be used on defense beforehand, which can whittle down their hitpoints. It is also even weaker to air units. You also shouldn't put two of them in the same deck for they are very expensive and you are left vulnerable to a punishment for your lack of Elixir.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the keys to defeating the Mega Knight is timing. To counter the Mega Knight properly, the counter unit should generally be placed no more than three tiles away from him, so that he doesn't initiate his jump attack and deal massive damage. Without it, his damage per second is somewhat low for his Elixir cost.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using the above strategy, ground tanks like the Knight and the Valkyrie or high-damage glass cannons like the Mini P.E.K.K.A. or the Goblin Brawler are the most Elixir-efficient counters to a lone Mega Knight coming onto the defender's side of the arena. With the help of the Princess Tower, the Mega Knight will not be able to take them before they are defeated.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only grounded tank that cannot be used in this way to counter the Mega Knight is the Ice Golem. Even if the defender attempts to kite the Mega Knight, he will still have a majority of his health left after dealing with the Ice Golem.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similar to the Bandit, the Mega Knight will re-target onto any troop placed nearby him if his original target ends up being farther away than the newly spawned troop. If the defender is in a situation where they know they cannot prevent his jump from occurring, they can still place a cheap troop like Skeletons in front of him right before he is about to jump to soak up the damage.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the Mega Knight's jump mechanic is not purely identical to the Bandit's dash ability. His charge time is 0.1 seconds slower and does not make him invincible. He will still take damage while he is airborne and can be defeated mid-air. Interestingly, while in mid-air, The Log, Earthquake and Bowler will not be able to damage him, but an X-Bow or Mortar will stay locked onto an airborne Mega Knight. As a result, he counters these siege buildings well as his jump is difficult to react to at the bridge and will take out a majority of their health. He can also take care of the weaker support troops backing up the building after taking it out. Sparky and Bomber will also hit the Mega Knight even when he jumps.\n",

            "The Bandit can fully counter a lone Mega Knight. By deploying her 4 tiles from the river and 3 tiles from the Princess Tower when the Mega Knight is 2 or 3 tiles from the river, she will dash at just the right time to nullify the jump damage of the Mega Knight as well as lure him into range of both Princess Towers.\n",

Air units like the Minions and the Bats also work well, but are usually vulnerable to spells.\n",
            "\n",
            "The P.E.K.K.A. is a great counter to the Mega Knight, as her high damage per second and high hitpoints allow her to defeat the Mega Knight 1-on-1 even without a Princess Tower helping. After defending, she will have a fair amount of hitpoints remaining in case the player would like to counterpush. In the case that your opponent reveals that they have P.E.K.K.A. first, it is best to drop the Mega Knight in the other lane as it is unlikely that they will have much Elixir to counter your Mega Knight. Additionally, the Mega Knight moves much faster than the P.E.K.K.A., and is harder to distract with swarms, making the P.E.K.K.A. approaching your tower fairly easy to deal with.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Inferno Tower and the Inferno Dragon can take out the Mega Knight as long as their ramp-up attack is uninterrupted. If they do get interrupted once, spending a bit more Elixir to deploy a distraction unit, such as an Ice Golem, will keep the Mega Knight in place and can allow either Inferno to defeat the Mega Knight, keeping a positive elixir trade (if you use Inferno Dragon + Ice Golem).\n",
            "\n",
            "Goblin Cage also can counter Mega Knight easily. Put Goblin Cage in the center of the arena and Mega Knight will destroy the cage and Goblin Brawler can defeat him because he has fast attack speed. You can also help the goblin brawler with 1 of any spirits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Mega Knight is helpless against air troops such as Minions and Bats, so it is best to pair him with other troops that can attack air, by using such as the Archers, the Wizard, or the Executioner.\n",
            "\n",
            "A Zap spell will not stop the Mega Knight from jumping once his charge initiates, neither does any stun effect. The jump can only be stopped if he is defeated mid-air, by using The Log, or if the player uses other cards to pull him out of his jumping range like a Tornado. When he is already mid-jump, only the Fisherman's dragging ability can cancel its effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "A Skeleton Army is typically not effective against the Mega Knight. In most cases, the Mega Knight will destroy the Skeleton Army even when he's surrounded due to his large splash radius. However, if he has around half of his hitpoints left, it can be effective to use the Skeleton Army on him.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, a Skeleton Army can be useful in taking him out if you have a tank soaking up the damage for them. You can place a tank in front of Mega Knight and place a Skeleton Army behind the Mega Knight.\n",

            "The Mega Knight can be used to counter a Goblin Barrel but it requires precise timing. His spawn damage can defeat all three Goblins if timed correctly — ideally, he should be deployed at the back of the Tower when the Goblin Barrel’s shadow crosses the river.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you find this too hard to execute, you can deploy the Mega Knight between two Goblins which will prevent most of the damage dealt to your Tower. This is done by placing the Mega Knight in between the top Goblin and the one at the bottom.\n",
            "\n",
            "The defender can use the Mega Knight's jump mechanic against him and activate their King's Tower with an Ice Spirit and Skeletons. The player should wait for the Mega Knight to approach their Princess Tower, and when he is about to jump, deploy the Ice Spirit four tiles from the King's Tower and one tile into his lane to redirect his jump. Afterwards, they should place Skeletons one tile from the King's Tower and one tile away from his lane, right before he jumps a second time. If done correctly, he will head towards the King's Tower after jumping onto the Skeletons, activating it. This will deal significant damage to the player's King's Tower however, so it is not recommended to perform this more than once.\n",
            "\n",
            "Likewise, Tombstone can also lure the Mega Knight into activating King's Tower, given the Tombstone is deployed right in front of the King's Tower to the Mega Knight side (7-2 placement). The Mega Knight will jump closer to the Tombstone and eventually destroy it, targeting the King's Tower afterward. For a slightly more expensive, but more consistent King activation, the Tombstone can be placed higher up, such as with a placement five tiles from the river and two tiles from the Princess Tower (5-2). After its destruction, the player can place a troop that is one shot by the Mega Knight's jump close to the King's Tower.\n",
            "\n",
            "Barbarians are an effective counter to the Mega Knight when played reactively, provided his jump is negated. They will counter him for a +2 Elixir trade. 3 of the Barbarians will survive (assuming they are the same or similar levels), demanding further response.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Mega Knight can be a potential counter to the Sparky. If the Sparky has low enough health and is about to cross the bridge, the spawn damage from the Mega Knight might be able to knock it out. If you time it correctly, the Mega Knight will absorb the Sparky's shot and with the help of a Tower, be able to destroy the Sparky. This will leave you with a relatively high health Mega Knight to do a counter-attack with. However, if the Sparky manages to defeat the Mega Knight, then it is a negative trade of one Elixir for you.\n",

Outside of the nucleus are two centrosomes, each containing a pair of centrioles, these structures are critical for the process of cell division. During interphase, microtubules extend from these centrosomes.\n",

            "The chromosomes condense into X-shaped structures that can be easily seen under a microscope. Each chromosome is composed of two sister chromatids, containing identical genetic information. The chromosomes pair up so that both copies of chromosome 1 are together, both copies of chromosome 2 are together, and so on. At the end of prophase the membrane around the nucleus in the cell dissolves away releasing the chromosomes.\n",

            "The chromosomes line up neatly end-to-end along the centre (equator) of the cell. The centrioles are now at opposite poles of the cell with the mitotic spindle fibres extending from them. The mitotic spindle fibres attach to each of the sister chromatids.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Anaphase:\n",
            "The sister chromatids are then pulled apart by the mitotic spindle which pulls one chromatid to one pole and the other chromatid to the opposite pole.\n",

            "At each pole of the cell a full set of chromosomes gather together. A membrane forms around each set of chromosomes to create two new nuclei.

Four ruffians broke into my house. \"What the devil?\" I said, as I grabbed my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blew a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he was dead on the spot. Drew my pistol on the second man and missed him entirely because it's smoothbore and I later found out that it nailed the neighbors dog. I had to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot. \"Tally ho lads!\" I yelled, as the grape shot shredded two men in the blast, the sound and shrapnel set off car alarms. I mounted my trusty war horse, Charles, and charged the last terrified rapscallion. Impaling him with my standard issue 2 foot bayonet. He bled out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds were impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.\n",
            "If you order these pair of high heels, these pair of socks, a roll of light pink lace trim, and sew the light pink lace trim onto the ankle ring of those thin white low cut sailor moon socks with pink hearts the gold sailor moon print the pink ankle ring, these high heels can be purchased even these socks and the pink lace trim like what is seen in this photo on Will Smith’s Instagram page. And once we get to my area and in my house I’ll sit you down and if you let me know your feet are hurting in those high heels like seen in the photo sent I can free your socked feet from those high heels like seen in the photo sent I will then smell and kiss your socked feet, and then I’ll take off those socks like in the photo sent and then you can lift your bare feet, spread your toes, wiggle them, and ask while you have your bare feet lifted, toes spread, and toes wiggling: do you wanna lick and kiss my feet? and I’ll definitely respond with a yes, and what you’ll do is slide yourself over to the loveseat side of the sectional sofa, get on your stomach, get 2 pillows to lay the side of your head on, your forelegs beyond the armrest, my fingers holding your ankles, my tongue stuck out, my head faced downward towards your feet but as close to your feet as possible almost touching, and my tongue touching your bare feet, then my tongue will lick your feet back and forth and doing circles on your bare heels, my tongue licking your toes, my lips touching your bare soles and heels and they’ll be held on your feet for up to 20 minutes before I go with the kiss, once your feet are kissed you’ll have to remain still that way your feet don’t escape my tongue licking them. So all day during the weekdays I’ll lick and kiss your bare feet as well as smell and kiss your socked feet. It’ll be so beautiful and you would want to have your feet licked and kissed anytime. You’ll love it and it’ll be a good thing to do for you\n",

            "Since a vasectomy is easily reversible and honestly way less dangerous than tying tubes, I think every male should be required to get a vasectomy once they start puberty. It would obviously cut back on teen pregnancy and in order to get the vasectomy reversed you should have to prove you have been with said partner for a set period of time and both take an IQ test. This will also reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies, shut everyone up on the my body my choice movement, and increase the intelligence of the state/country you are in. This would also really help reduce the need for social programs where some people just have children because they view them as pay checks. The only downside I see is people getting upset over forcing medical procedures but realistically it is for the betterment of everyone.\n",

            "The thought of putting a toothbrush (for humans) in my dogs mouth and brushing her teeth has never even crossed my mind let alone something I have to do daily. After 9 years of owning my Boarder Collie/ Crocker Spaniel mix I am just now being presented with and judged  by this silly standard. I was throwing the frisbee for my dog at my normal dog park I visit more than 3x a week and talking with some lady walking her husky. She was completely baffled and I thought she couldn't be serious and told her \"well I don't lift my leg to pee so why and how could a dog brush its teeth\". She didn't like my response and then started threatening to call the police because I did not bring a leash to the park. All in all it seems like a pretty tedious task and theres no way my dog wouldn't resist me trying to force something into her mouth other than food or a toy. Without a human a dog couldn't brush their teeth and now I'm looking on the internet at doggo dental products and it's all so expensive. It all seems like a gimmick and completely pointless to do. My dog is very active and still catches frisbees at 9 years old. She's healthy and I take her to the vet twice a year. Not once have they mentioned  anything as far as dental hygiene goes. To be fair I take sticks that have fallen from the trees and throw those for her too and she's about shredded up the log she dragged home from the neighbors house. so she chews on alot of wood. Maybe that's why I have no need to do such a ridiculous thing because I actually take care of my best friend.\n",

I started seeing my doctor again after almost 3 years because I was very concerned and did not trust myself. Before I went to see him, I researched the way I feel, I realized that my feelings and symptoms closely resembled those pf PTSD. I brought this up with him, starting off with \"I know I shouldn't do this but...\" To which he replied \"I wish more people did\" from the appointment we decided it was best that I go directly to the crisis center in the ER. I saw three separate psychiatrists in the first two days I was there, they all confirmed my suspicions, PTSD. Leading up to a separate, more recent occasion, I had been researching again, and low and behold, my doctor is sending me for blood work and brain imaging. One of my issues is, I don't recognize what's normal bodily function and what's not, apparently it's not okay to have multiple falls at 20 years old, to not be able to hold your bladder for longer than a few minutes, for your heart rate to not fluctuate with exercise, but these are just a few of the things that I thought were normal, because I've been living with them for as long as I can remember. \n",

You have reduced the big picture down to tiny bits. Like as much as i enjoy listening to analysis and podcasts about movies, i don't want those videos to come into my head while i'm watching the movie.  Distracting me, breaking my illusion from it, telling me why the movie i am watching is so great or so bad; it would be better to just experience it. Most of the channels come from film students trying to make something of their own by analysing the craft of other classic movies that came before. That analysis about the shot selection, plot elements, twist, music que and score is great but after listening to many of those i have found myself focusing on those people's talking points in my head more rather than watching those play out in the movie. I would rather let myself come to the conclusion about the great stuff in those movie by myself. That's what it's so terrible about reviews and reactions with Superhero movies today, People break stuff down to moments that they cheered or enjoyed rather than the movie as a whole.\n",

You don't need to know about the screenplay techniques that make something tick with you or something that keeps you engrossed in the film. Like with videos on film techniques, i feel like only those people who are interested in making movies or are already part of it should watch those more than anybody. Like Corridor Crew on YouTube, i enjoy hearing them talk about VFX in movies but after a while it just gets down to everything coming off from a computer. The techniques they talk about interest only the ones who are working on it. They are great at highlighting older movie effects and appreciating the work people put in and that's kind of thing should be appreciated by its community more. Its like a magic trick. After explaining how the trick works, it fades the fun away from wondering about it.  Not saying we shouldn't appreciate the work people put in.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **it’s your responsibility to check what you believe:** the reason people have to provide sources in scientific work isn’t to convince others but to make it easier to see how somebody came to a certain conclusion and to be able to talk about new concepts and informations instantly. It’s not that random stranger have to work to make you believe what’s right. You have to figure it out by yourself - people pointing out spots you’re wrong is a friendly service, no duty.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **A good source isn’t automatically a right source and other way around:** sources are just an indicator, no guarantee. Good sources can lie and bad sources can say the truth. There was a time where church was the good source per default and guys like Darwin, Galileo, Newton where the bad sources. In fact every concept that contradicts the previous one is seem as a bad source at the beginning. It’s up to you to see what is right.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Not every source has to be linked. „According to Sigmund Freud“, „The Study XYZ by Name from the university ABC“ or „in the book Name by Author on page X it says“ are valid naming of sources:** Naming a source has to give you the opportunity to check it. It mustn’t be easy to check, or free, or in the internet. A source is the Place the spokesman got their informations. It’s not a magic place the spokesman has to find for you so you could consume the background of an statement easily.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Telling someone you won’t believe anybody because they don’t deliver a source you like might let you win the argument, but don’t provide any benefits in most cases:** In most cases (all those that aren’t about if a certain thin happened or not - and even those often are excluded from the exception) this is just a trolling strategy to end the discussion. It’s no prove of concept at all. You’re not right just because someone doesn’t provide a source. Also to end an argument doesn’t give you right and ending an argument is not winning an argument.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **This post shouldn’t be an unpopular opinion because it’s scientific consensus:** everything I’m posting in this post are rules of scientific work - it’s called critical thinking. People wo don‘t believe in it and still argument with sources don’t understand what they are arguing about. You should not demand a source ever again as long you don’t understand these concepts. To demand a source is a preparation for critical thinking, not critical thinking itself. It doesn’t matter if a source was delivered or not - You still have to think critical in both cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **last but not least - to be critical and questioning something isn’t just asking questions about status quo:** critical thinking is checking every recourses and sources and making conclusions. You not just ask questions, you also answer those questions. The questions where made to check the believes, not to make a statement. They aren’t there for others delivering you something you can believe, they are made for giving you the resources to make your own conclusions (ohh and making an conclusions isn’t about to decide what side you prefer, but about figuring out what’s right besides of all sympathy). Edit: and critical isn’t against in general. You can be pro something and still critical with it. Critical is a method - not a position.\n",

People on Reddit will comment on anything that’s on the front page with little thought and that’s okay. Troll away. All you guys did was prove my point on how unpopular this is. Can’t wait till more people post opinions so my thread can get off the front page. I haven’t slept since the incident since my baby hasn’t slept since the incident. These people also threatened me when I tried to ask them to be more cautious of noise. I plan to tell my landlord or even call the police if they try to hit me just for asking them to lower the volume at 1am-3am and then at 5am-6am again where they woke my son up twice. Have a good day everyone and glad you can laugh at me or troll me to make yourselves feel better.\n",

            "I have been looking at what people are posting in the halo subreddit and what I see are people who do not understand game development progress and people who are not patient. When the game came out,  there was a set date for when the second season would come out and more content would drop, and people were enjoying the game when it first came out, 343 did listen to the feedback from halo 5 and they made a good game. It does have some issues like the xp system could use a bit of reworking and the customization system could as well. however these people do not understand is that reworking entire systems for a game takes a lot of time to test and develop. New content also takes time to be developed and its not like the second season has come out yet and we haven't gotten anything new. Hell we are getting teasers and info drops about the second season , and yesterday it was said that we are getting more info about season 2 very soon, and nothing ever satisfies these people. Forge is coming and from the leaks it looks like the it is the most capable and complicated forge to date which is amazing. another point is how people want every thing in the multiplayer to be free which is not feasible for a free to play multiplayer, some people have good ideas for a earnable currency through gameplay along with real life money. I find that people on the halo subreddit complain way too much and do not have any sort of patience, they expect new stuff right this instant. They also tend to get mad at either false things or misquoted articles, like for the halo tv show, a misquoted article said that they didn't look at the game when making the show, which people on the halo subreddit heard about and started being toxic towards people who made the show, and very recently people are getting angry about another misquoted article which allegedly says how 343 hates there fanbase, when in reality it says that they want to communicate with the fans to improve the game, while having halo reach a broader audience. Also for some reason these people do not like the idea of Halo Infinite reaching out to a broader audience, which is a good thing for me as more people would be halo fans, but these people want halo to only be for \"True Halo Fans\", which is stupid because we shouldn't gate keep on who can like or play halo infinite.   I really feel bad for the developers at 343 industries due to how the negative and toxic feedback from the fans can affect them, and probably more crunch time due to trying to appease this fanbase. Halo 5 did have monthly content drops but developers at 343 were extremely exhausted from making these content drops at this extremely fast paced speed, and having longer periods of time between content drops can have people make higher quality stuff.\n",
