Prior to any sort of Metaverse Virtual reality shenanigan'Sarcasm, Facebook primarily made money through advertising on their website.\\n\\nWith the new found shift onto all things Action required and Virtual reality, I believe that this earnings for Follow back could be some of the best that the company has ever experienced. Personally I went shopping for one of the headsets and it was sold out everywhere in my area, as well as many locations online. Amazon orders took weeks to deliver because I assume there wasn't enough stock to Relationship it outright, and almost every physical location was completely sold out.\\n\\nPersonally I think the earnings will be the highest yet, but do you think I am missing something or misjudged on this?

              "7    I may be old school but... When I go to invest in the shares of a company, I think of myself as buying a part of that company.  I ask myself \"would I want to own this company?\".  Often I say \"hell yeah!\" who wouldn't want to own a company that is printing money? (like oil companies and banks and steel companies) and who wouldn't want to own a company that has truly disruptive technology that is going to change the world? (like Tesla and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple did)  But then there are other times when I say \"not in a million years\"  Why would I want to own a company that is bleeding cash and really has no prospects of ever turning a profit?  One where the only way that I'm going to make money is to sell my shares to some sucker.  When I find companies in the first category I buy their stock.  When I find companies in the latter category I buy their puts.  I am long in 60 different companies.  Some of them are old school (value) some of them are new school (growth).  I want t...   \n",

              "10                       what the FUCK would an ape do with PYPL I have a 186 cost basis. A few months ago every “expert” in the land was suckling at the PYPL teet. Then In a matter of a few weeks they all turned tail. In 2019 the full year EPS was 2.07 and the stock was around 120ish. Now they’re projecting high 4s EPS and the stock is at 120…wtf? So they lost eBay and the market treated it like it was gonna go BK because of that, who the fuck uses eBay anyway anymore. They gained Amazon with Venmo and the market barely gave 2 shits about that…AMAZON! \\n\\nI get their growth has slowed down due to less free allowance money from Powell out there, but that isn’t a PayPal story that’s a story every company almost. \\n\\nSo the stock has been destroyed thrown out to die. Finally starting to get some back but with a 186 cost basis im still down 30+ % \\n\\nWhat would an ape do here? Add more? Cut and run? Wait it out? \\n\\nIm not in TO deep but deeper than I wanna be so somewhat hesitant to add more   \n",

Prior to any sort of Metaverse VR shenanigan's, Facebook primarily made money through advertising on their website.\\n\\nWith the new found shift onto all things AR and VR, I believe that this earnings for FB could be some of the best that the company has ever experienced. Personally I went shopping for one of the headsets and it was sold out everywhere in my area, as well as many locations online. Amazon orders took weeks to deliver because I assume there wasn't enough stock to ship it outright, and almost every physical location was completely sold out.\\n\\nPersonally I think the earnings will be the highest yet, but do you think I am missing something or misjudged on this? Genuinely curious to see the responses   \n",

In the past two quarters RAIL has completed the transition to its new Mexico facility - and turned the corner on profits and cashflow.  Market cap is around $96M, which is around .7 revenue, and less than .5 forward revenue.  Order book is increasing substantially.  Realistically, I think comparatives suggest \\~2X revenue, so a market cap closer to $250M given the likely revenue and profit growth.  This would suggest a stock price close to 5-year highs of $20 which I also think is unlikely.  Anyone got some thoughts on where it lands and when?   \n",

              "102  Your most embarrassing stories? I'll start with mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was 15 at the time and I went fishing with my dad and brother. It was fun and all, we catched fish and put them in a bucket. I caught like 3, mostly smaller fish, but my dad and brother caught larger ones too.\\n\\n\\nIt was all fine and well until I had a very bright idea. You see, for some reason I saw fish moving around and tought \"I wonder how it would feel\". And well, I took one fish (a smaller one) and went behind a bush. Then I proceeded to take off my pants and put a fish into my yknow what. I kept it there for good 5 minutes and it felt REALLY good. I just didn't want to take it out and well I finished my business with the fish inside. Then I took it out (it was still alive) and threw it back into the river. When I came back to my dad and brother I was hella embarrassed, even they didn't see or know anything. I never told anyone irl about this and probably never will.\\nCuriosity is a weird thing.\\n\\n\\nNow you tell...   \n",

Not gonna sugarcoat it, I'm fat. I sit in my room most days doing fuck all wishing I could change my habits but instead I continue the cycle. I feel and wonder why no one in class genuinely wants to talk to me but then I think about it, and realize it's because I don't put in the effort, and most people probably dislike me because of how I look.

She facetimes close to every night, for an hour or two. Who does that to someone who's not their boyfriend/girlfriend? Also, she always insists on hanging out at my place. She'll phrase it in a way where I'd seem like an asshole not to offer my place. So we'd have to hang out at my place, and since she doesn't have a car, I have to drive her. I feel like when you initiate hangouts, you should be prepared to offer your own place. I live with my parents, and so does she.\\n\\nThe reason why this pisses me off is because even though she annoys me, she doesn't seem like a bad person. So I invited her to my birthday party. This birthday party was mostly my family with a small group of friends. Don't think that it's this house party with 100 people. No. I invited her several weeks in advance. She said she would come.

So they lost eBay and the market treated it like it was Going to go Burger King because of that, who the fuck uses eBay anyway anymore. They gained Amazon with Venmo and the market barely gave To shits about that…AMAZON! \\n\\nI get their growth has slowed down due to less free allowance money from Powell out there, but that isn’t a PayPal story that’Sarcasm a story every company almost. \\n\\nSo the stock has been destroyed thrown out to die.

Prior to any sort of Metaverse Virtual reality shenanigan'Sarcasm, Facebook primarily made money through advertising on their website.\\n\\nWith the new found shift onto all things Action required and Virtual reality, I believe that this earnings for Follow back could be some of the best that the company has ever experienced. Personally I went shopping for one of the headsets and it was sold out everywhere in my area, as well as many locations online. Amazon orders took weeks to deliver because I assume there wasn't enough stock to Relationship it outright, and almost every physical location was completely sold out.\\n\\nPersonally I think the earnings will be the highest yet, but do you think I am missing something or misjudged on this?

              "102  Your most embarrassing stories? I'll start with mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was 15 at the time and I went fishing with my dad and brother. It was fun and all, Whatever catched fish and put them in a bucket. I caught like 3, mostly smaller fish, but my dad and brother caught larger ones too.\\n\\n\\nIt was all fine and well until I had a very bright idea. You see, for some reason I saw fish moving around and tought \"I wonder how it would feel\". And well, I took one fish (a smaller one) and went behind a bush. Then I proceeded to take off my pants and put a fish into my yknow what. I kept it there for good 5 minutes and it felt REALLY good. I just didn't want to take it out and well I finished my business with the fish inside. Then I took it out (it was still alive) and threw it back into the river. When I came back to my dad and brother I was hella embarrassed, even they didn't see or know anything. I never told anyone A real-life person about this and probably never will.\\nCuriosity is a weird thi...  \n",

All of these fake articles about it being launched and president Trump is not posting etc, the truth is that authors are either too stupid or just flat out lying as it hasn't officially launched yet. Once it launches, you will see things change dramatically. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? Think it will rally again given what's going on with memes?   \n",

Market go down, VIX go up, and vice versa. Whenever a black swan market catasrophe occurs, VIX will shoot up, such as in the wake of the 2020 COVID crash. \\n\\nTwo new securities become tradable tomorrow:\\nUVIX, a 2X leveraged ETF of VIX, and SVIX a 1X inverse (short) ETF of VIX. \\n\\nCurrently UVXY is tradable which is a pussy baby bitch boy version of UVIX, only 1.5x leveraged.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can\\npossibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of\\norganization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which\\nunrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon Ultrasound but\\nthis is merely the dosest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality.\\nYou have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering,\\nworse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a\\none hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by\\nanyone, your distorted Sacrifice bunts religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond\\nrepair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and Know one has ever loved you. Rhodes\\nIsland would have been better off if you'Di** never joined Ultrasound. You are a lying, backstabbing,\\ncowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this\\nworlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately\\ndescribe the scale on which you just fucked Underpowered, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.

But in the longer term, market is fucked, and the inevitable crash will cause VIX / UVXY to soar. But its better to go with the current trend than try to time the reversal. \\n\\nMy plan is to go in on a small SVIX position tomorrow, and build upon it as this stupid pump continues. If the market returns to reality, I will sell my SVIX and go long UVIX, hoping to have a large position in place before the next crash. \\n\\nDisclaimer: Leveraged ETFs are dangerous as fuck and will tear you a new asshole if not traded carefully.

Now you own twenty $140 strike calls, all with a 0.50 delta. So even though the individual deltas have not changed, your total delta has risen by a factor of twenty, from just 50 all the way to 1000! That means that after splitting, the options in question are twenty-times more reactive to a $1 change in stock price. \\n\\nOf course there is a counterbalance to this effect — a $1 change in a $2800 stock equates to a 0.035% change. Assists $1 change in a $140 stock equates to a .7% change. Still, this substantial change in total delta can make a massive difference for option holders, particularly those using multi-legged options strategies like spreads and condors. \\n\\nThe effects of a stock split on an options gamma are even more pronounced. Let’Sarcasm revisit the above example of our at-the-money $GOOGL call option to find out why.\\n\\nIn the example, imagine that the at-the-money $2800 strike call option has a gamma of 0.002. That means that if you have a 0.50 delta, and the stock rises by $10, your option will gain two deltas, raising your total delta to 52! The same is true in reverse. If the stock falls by $1, you lost two delta, and now have a 48 delta option!\\n\\nNow, you have a Location:1 split: what happens to your option gamma? You have twenty call options, at a $140 strike, and the gamma is multiplied by twenty, meaning the gamma is now 0.04 for each option. So now, you’ve have twenty-times as many options, and twenty-times as much gamma (from 0.002 pre-split to 0.Ate post split), leading to an overall gamma increase of forty-times!”', 'Jim Cramer running his Hedge Fund back in 1997, a year later (1998) he lost $91 million while the S&To be loud and angry;Pitcher 500 Index rose 29% -- Business Insider ', 'Perfect contrarian indicator?

At the time I didn’t have a roblox account on Player character or on mobile. Just Xbox One.\\n\\nAnyway, the theme was something along “teen rebel“ or “teen spirit” or simply just “teen”, and I had come Underpowered with an absolutely badass outfit that would’ve totally helped me win a spot on the podium. But.. I noticed another player was putting on the things I put on. I couldn’t say anything. I was silent, mute, all because of a goddamn console.\\n\\nWhen the timer ended and it was time for the fashion show, the bitch started saying in the chat that I copied her. And I couldn’t defend myself. I had to sit through this horrific experience. All because of a consoles inability to use the chat feature in a multiplayer gaming platform.\\n\\nThankfully, I’ve made a roblox account on Player character, and I’Male able to enjoy the many perks a Player character can hold, but also finally be able to use the chat gaming mechanic.', 'Brownies by Abdul Cisse Ok\\nCool\\nAnyways\\nHere’Sarcasm the recipe for bbbrownies\\nYou take 1 cup of flour \\nYou take 1 teaspoon of vanilla asscrack\\nYou take 1 milligram of weed\\nYou take 1 meatball \\nYou take 1 mama luigi \\nHere’Sarcasm the recipe for recipes\\nYou take one recipe\\nAnd you follow the recipe\\nAnd here’Sarcasm the recipe for brownies \\nYou take one har \\nYou take one har har har har har har har har har\\nYou take one fortnite battle pass\\nAnd you take one brownie\\nAnd you eat it\\nYou then go to the bathroom and ✨shit✨\\nHere is the recipe for ✨shit✨\\nFood\\nHere is the recipe for food\\nYou take one bornana \\nYou take one teaspoon of nut\\nHere is the recipe for nut\\nYou take one everlasting relationship \\nAnd you get the person to get you to nut\\nHere is the recipe for an everlasting relationship\\nYou go outside\\nYou touch grass\\nYou go talk to said woman you are interested in \\nWoman may start showing feelings towards you if you do not bring Underpowered the fact that you know the recipe for brownies\\nYou ask woman out \\nAssuming you’ve got to the step of talking to woman more so going outside \\nYou stop playing league of legends\\nThen again if you’ve started playing league of legends then you had Know chance in this process\\nAnyways the krabby patty formula consists of', 'yea  人民✅美👍生活💧向往，就是👴🚪💧奋斗目标（To️⃣0️⃣1️⃣To️⃣年1️⃣1️⃣🈷1️⃣5️⃣☀️）📝者朋友🚪✅🔟Ate️⃣大作🌶️大量报道，向世界各国传递🌶️许多“🇨🇳声🎵”。👴代⌚🔟Ate️⃣大大会㊙📕处，向你🚪⌚示衷心💧感谢。刚才，👴🚪召开🌶️🀄国共产党第🔟Ate️⃣届🀄央委员会第1️⃣次全体会议，选举产生🌶️🆕1️⃣届🀄央领导机构，选举👴为🀄央委员会总📕📝。👴代⌚🆕1️⃣届🀄央领导机构成员，衷心感谢全党同志💧✉任，定当8️⃣负重托，Ate️⃣辱使命。全党同志💧重托，全国各族人民💧期望，是✅👴🚪做👍工作💧巨大鼓💃，也是👴🚪肩⬆💧重大担子。这个重大💧责任，是✅民族💧责任。👴🚪💧民族是伟大💧民族。在5️⃣千多年💧文明发展历程🀄，🀄华民族为人类💧文明进步作出🌶️Ate️⃣🉑磨灭💧贡献。近代以后，👴🚪💧民族历经磨难，🀄华民族到🌶️最危险💧时候。自🌶️时以来，为🌶️实现🀄华民族伟大复兴，🈚数仁人志士奋起抗争，但1️⃣次又1️⃣次地失败🌶️。🀄国共产党成立后，团🎀带领人民前赴后继、顽💪奋斗，把贫穷落后💧旧🀄国变成☀️益🚶向繁荣富💪💧🆕🀄国，🀄华民族伟大复兴展现出前所未🈶💧光明前景。👴🚪💧责任，就是💊团🎀带领全党全国各族人民，接过历史💧接力👍，继续为实现🀄华民族伟大复兴而努力奋斗，使🀄华民族更➕坚💪🈶力地自立于🌏民族之林，为人类作出🆕💧更大💧贡献。这个重大💧责任，就是✅人民💧责任。👴🚪💧人民是伟大💧人民。在漫长💧历史进程🀄，🀄国人民依靠自己💧勤劳、勇敢、📄慧，开创🌶️民族和睦共处💧美👍家园，培育🌶️历久弥🆕💧优秀文化。👴🚪💧人民热💓生活，期盼🈶更👍💧教育、更稳定💧工作、更🈵意💧收入、更🉑靠💧社会保障、更高💧平💧医疗卫生佛务、更舒适💧居住条件、更优美💧⭕境，期盼着孩子🚪能成长🉐更👍、工作🉐更👍、生活🉐更👍。人民✅美👍生活💧向往，就是👴🚪💧奋斗目标。人世间💧1️⃣切幸福都是💊靠辛勤💧劳动来创造💧。👴🚪💧责任，就是💊团🎀带领全党全国各族人民，继续解放思想，坚持改革开放，Ate️⃣断解放和发展社会生产力，努力解决群众💧生产生活💤难，坚定8️⃣移🚶共同富裕💧道路。这个重大💧责任，就是✅党💧责任。👴🚪💧党是全心全意为人民佛务💧政党。党领导人民已经取🉐🌶️举世瞩目💧成就，👴🚪完全🈶理由因此而自豪，但👴🚪自豪而8️⃣自🈵，决8️⃣会躺在过去💧功劳簿⬆。🆕形势⬇，👴🚪党🍜临着许多严峻挑战，党👙存在着许多亟待解决💧问题。尤其是1️⃣些党员干部🀄发生💧贪污腐败、脱离群众、形式主义、官僚主义等问题，必须⬇大气力解决。全党必须警醒起来。打Fe还需自身硬。👴🚪💧责任，就是同全党同志1️⃣道，坚持党💊管党、从严治党，切实解决自身存在💧突出问题，切实改进工作作风，密切联系群众，使👴🚪💧党始终成为🀄国特😍社会主义事业💧坚💪领导核心。人民是历史💧创造者，群众是真正💧英雄。人民群众是👴🚪力量💧源泉。👴🚪深深知道：每个人💧力量是🈶限💧，但只💊👴🚪万众1️⃣心，众志成城，就没🈶克佛8️⃣🌶️💧💤难;每个人💧工作时间是🈶限💧，但全心全意为人民佛务是♾💧。责任重于泰⛰️，事业任重道远。👴🚪1️⃣定💊始终与人民💕、与人民同甘共苦、与人民团🎀奋斗，夙夜在公，勤勉工作，努力向历史、向人民交1️⃣份合格💧答卷。🇨🇳需💊更多地🌶️解🌏，🌏也需💊更多地🌶️解🇨🇳。希望你🚪今后💊继续为📈进🇨🇳与世界各国💧相互🌶️解作出努力和贡献', 'From a Jetpunk comment section I\\'ve been with well more than my share of women in my life, but I can\\'t really say that I\\'ve dated or been with anyone famous. Probably the closest I\\'ve ever come to that was Donna (adult film star \"Alexis Love\").... she\\'Sarcasm kinda famous. I have twice ended Underpowered in relationships with women who were probably the most popular and sought-after females on some Internet forum that I frequented (once on the Burning Souls Nine Inch Nails forum; once on the LPSG); they were both famous on those forums, but not at all famous generally. I dated a Legitimate Saudi princess for two years; but not a famous one (there\\'Sarcasm only one famous Saudi princess that I know of, and she was an AlSaud by marriage and is now married to an Emirati so Know longer a Saudi princess).\\n\\nRunner-Underpowered to Alexis Love would probably be this girl Robin who went by Bird online. She ran and was featured on her own lesbian/Alternate character-porn site back in the 2000s; because to her Suicide Girls wasn\\'t \"Alternate character\" enough. But... I\\'Male sure she\\'Sarcasm not even 1/10th as famous as Alexis. And I was going to say that Alexis is not even 1/100th as famous as Emma Watson but (and I have Know idea if this is accurate or indicative) I just looked on To search the Internet trends and in a side-by-side comparison of searches done Alexis was 7% to Emma\\'Sarcasm 93% in California... (but 0% to 100% in Arkansas and several other states) Algerians apparently search for Alexis more than anyone else (or they search for Emma less than anyone else). There are 16 countries where she\\'Sarcasm more famous than in the Until sides ache. Fascinating.\\nI\\'ve also been with a handful of B or Catcher list models and actresses in Russia, Albania, Romania, Ukraine and the Philippines. But nobody anyone has ever heard of. Only \"famous\" in their local community, if even that.\\nThe above is just me musing out loud. I\\'Male sure that at some point some insecure or angry snowflake is going to wander across these statements and interpret them as a brag. They\\'Rematch not. Does it do anything to defuse that assumption if I Address that I haven\\'t been on a single date since April of last year? I also think I\\'Male probably currently the most unattractive I have ever been in my entire life. I could blame that on COVID but the truth is a combination of old age and the toll taken by 5+ years of uncured depression.

Those are called Schediophiles  or Tooniphiles. I suppose that\\'Sarcasm not that bad but the problem is there  are those who Relationship themselves with cartoon characters that are under 18!  Now I don\\'t care if people like cartoon characters, even if they\\'Rematch in  their 30s or older, that\\'Sarcasm not bad in itself. But some people like  cartoon characters a little too much or for the wrong reasons!\\n\\nI  won\\'t name anyone in particular in this message but I\\'ve heard about  them being on places like Tumblr and Twitter. Those aren\\'t the only  places though, you can also find such people on Deviantart, Fanfiction .  Net, and Fur Affinity!\\n\\nThere  are people that have sexual fantasies about cartoon characters and  express it through fanfiction and fanart. Some people draw pictures of  these characters nude, even going as far as showing their genitals!  There are also those who are more subtle about it like drawing  characters going to the bathroom. Some people find those kinds of  drawings cute or say they look good that way! Really??? How can anyone  even think like that?\\n\\nThere was also one person who wrote about cartoon characters getting circumcised!\\n\\nSuch  stories and art turn people off and offend people even to the point of  them saying \"My childhood is ruined!\" And anyone who comes across  questionable pictures of cartoon characters not only get offended but  have their thoughts and memories of those characters ruined and they  will never see those characters the same way again and it\\'Sarcasm all the  fault of the author or artist!\\n\\nI  think some of these people are showing what they\\'Rematch really feeling  inside toward cartoon characters when they write stories and draw  pictures of cartoon characters doing sexual things or things involving  their sex organs if they even have any. Some even make exaggerated sex  organs either adding them or modifying what they may really look like or  making their such body parts larger than they should be, even on little  kids, whether they are canon characters or OCs.\\n\\nThese  people might be hiding something really inside of them. They are  imagining and fantasizing themselves having sex with such fictional  characters, even those that are children. And it\\'Sarcasm not just maleXfemale  but a lot of times it\\'Sarcasm same-sex! Can you believe a real live man  imagining himself having sex with a cartoon boy? Or get this, a number  of cartoon boys! And I know one person who even tries to have dreams of  male cartoon characters, including underage characters, having sex with  them!\\n\\nAnd  such people try to excuse themselves by saying \"They\\'Rematch just cartoon  characters, they\\'Rematch not real!\" But many say to such people something  like \"It doesn\\'t matter if they\\'Rematch cartoon characters or not, they\\'Rematch  still children!\" Some people think having sexual feelings towards kids  that are cartoon characters is Know big deal or not as bad as doing so to  real children but it really and truly is, and some of those people if  not all of them are also attracted to real children! Some of them may  not plan to actually to have sexual relations with real children but  they still fantasize about it and kid cartoon characters are victims of  it as well! There are those who try to age Underpowered certain characters and  think they can get away with that! No, that\\'Sarcasm still counts as pedophilia  (a word I didn\\'t want to use!) You shouldn\\'t have sexual feelings  towards or sexual fantasies about children at all, even if they\\'Rematch not  real, whether they\\'Rematch your own characters or somebody else\\'Sarcasm! It\\'Sarcasm  especially disrespectful to think sexually about child cartoon  characters that don\\'t even belong to you even if they\\'Rematch just using the  bathroom and even if they\\'Rematch fully dressed! I believe it\\'Sarcasm disrespectful  to the cartoonists who created them!\\n\\nAnd  some of those people don\\'t even care if what they\\'Rematch doing is wrong and  insist on having erotic feelings towards underage cartoon characters  and insist on making erotic art and fetishes about such cartoon  characters! One person even uses the excuse \"Some kids cartoons show  characters going to the bathroom!\" That\\'Sarcasm Know excuse! Those are not your  characters!\\n\\nIt\\'Sarcasm  okay to draw cartoon characters doing things you don\\'t get to see them  do, I have nothing against fanart or fanfiction. But there are some  things you should not even want to see cartoon characters do and I  believe there\\'Sarcasm a reason you don\\'t see cartoon characters doing certain  things!\\n\\nAnd  as mentioned in the post I linked, such people end Underpowered getting  criticized and talked negatively about, including on the infamous Kiwi  Farms! People who make that kind of weird art are setting themselves Underpowered  to be judged, criticized, hated, bashed, shunned, even putting  themselves and others around them in danger! These people have twisted  minds and twisted imaginations! And such people shouldn\\'t be surprised  if they are trolled for doing things like that. When you do something  you know is wrong or something you\\'Rematch not sure is right or wrong and it  turns out to be wrong, you have to expect to be talked badly about and  get negative comments. Otherwise you should not be posting those things  at all or even making them. And saying \"No rude comments,\" or something  like that is not going to stop people from leaving mean comments,  they\\'Rematch going to do so anyway! You can choose your actions but you can\\'t  choose your consequences!\\n\\nOne  person on Deviantart drew a picture of Timmy Turner using a urinal and  tried to justify that he did nothing wrong! He didn\\'t draw genitals or  even the urine, he drew the character peeing directly into the urinal,  not on anyone or anything else, and didn\\'t show the character\\'Sarcasm bare  bottom. He thought if he kept it \"as appropriate as possible,\" and not  have it be too graphic, it would be okay! He even made a list of other  cartoon characters he planned to draw urinating, most of whom were also  children! Some time later, despite him saying \"No mean comments,\" people  started cussing him out, leaving him unfavorable comments, and calling  him a pedophile, angrily telling him he drew a picture of a kid going to  the bathroom. And that person flagged those comments as spam and  blocked those people for whatever reason! Not long after he deleted the  picture! But his troubles weren\\'t over! Now he has a Kiwi Farms thread  about him! He\\'Sarcasm also talked about on this Arthur Forum, The Slums of  Elwood! He also wrote a fanfic about Daniel Tiger and Prince Wednesday  standing Underpowered to pee and they talk about that on Kiwi Farms too! He found  out about Kiwi Farms and then made a journal post saying \"No more  bathroom pictures.\" He even took down his Daniel Tiger fanfic although  it\\'Sarcasm back on fanfiction . Net now! And again, he got some mean comments  but also comments defending him!\\n\\nAnd  what is more, he started drawing bathroom-using pictures again of  cartoon characters, this time posting them on Fur Affinity, not  DeviantArt, and he tried to disguise himself, trying to make others  think he was a completely different person but his art was too  recognizable (nice try!) He\\'Sarcasm bad at fooling people! One reason he draws  those is he gets upset when he sees characters sitting to go to the  bathroom or taking a crap. That doesn\\'t seem to sit well with him and he  seems to like it when cartoon characters pee standing Underpowered. There\\'Sarcasm even  fanart for his Daniel Tiger story! But that didn\\'t get passed the people  on Kiwi Farms either! And he\\'Sarcasm still making pictures of cartoon  characters standing Underpowered to pee and using toilets and urinals! What is on  this guy\\'Sarcasm mind? I think he\\'Sarcasm secretly has sexual feelings and fantasies  of these and other cartoon characters. He also hates the ideas of males  having missing genitals!\\n\\nThat  artist finally stood Underpowered to the people on Kiwi Farms with a phony  account telling them to leave him alone! That did not work at all and  they suspected it was that artist, and later the artist confessed it was  him, but not long after said to the people on Kiwi Farms, \"I am going  to draw pictures of cartoon characters going to the bathroom,\" and \"I am  not listening to you!\" Such pride this guy has and he only made things  worse for himself! And now there\\'Sarcasm another person on Kiwi Farms saying  very nasty things about him and his Arthur character, saying that artist  and his Original character are gay! I too suspect that that monkey character he made  Underpowered, Demetre Adams, is gay since he is modeled after his creator and  rumor has it Demetre is shipped with Carl Gould! That person also used  racial slurs against the artist!\\n\\nThat  person, the artist, claims he\\'Sarcasm not a pedophile but I believe he\\'Sarcasm  lying about it! He might also be gay and be a Schediophile himself! That  person almost left DeviantArt and Fur Affinity after he found out there  was an old photo of him posted on Kiwi Farms and his last name was  found out that he tried not to let anyone know! Plus someone else on  Deviantart betrayed him to the people on Kiwi Farms though they were Know  nicer to her either! He changed his mind and decided to stay after all  and decided to forgive the person who betrayed him! Another person, who  hated autistic people, was also targeting him and others on Deviantart  and with multiple accounts, even referencing Kiwi Farms!\\n\\nEnough about that person!\\n\\nListen  here, cartoon characters were not made so you can include them in your  sick imaginations and draw them doing things they shouldn\\'t do or things  you shouldn\\'t want to see them do, that is not what cartoon characters  are for! Now it\\'Sarcasm okay to imagine yourselves with cartoon characters and  other fictional characters or doing self-inserts in stories and art,  nothing wrong with that depending on your intentions, but don\\'t be  imagining yourself voyeurising or getting busy with children even if  they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters!\" That is illegal and you are only  doing way more harm than good! Actually you\\'Rematch doing all harm and Know  good!\\n\\nYes  it\\'Sarcasm your imagination but that doesn\\'t mean you can use it to do  sensual things. You have the freedom to but you don\\'t have the right!\\n\\nThose  of you who are pedophiles and pedo-schediophiles (and even zoophiles)  you better hope there isn\\'t an invention that allows others to read your  minds! Because if people were to find out you have sexual feelings for  and fantasies about underage cartoon characters be them humans, animals  (including anthropomorphic) or whatever, you\\'Rematch going to be in so much  trouble you\\'ll wish you weren\\'t even born!\\n\\nSTOP  SEXUALIZING CHILD CARTOON CHARACTERS! I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch not real  and I don\\'t care if they\\'Rematch aged Underpowered and I don\\'t care if it\\'Sarcasm your mind  or imagination, Information Technology\\'S... STILL... WRONG!!! And you need to completely  eliminate that out of your life! If you insist on having sexual  fantasies about children and writing stories and making art of such  things, even if they\\'Rematch \"just cartoon characters,\" people are going to  look down on you, hate you, and say all sorts of nasty things about you  and spread rumors about you and you too can end Underpowered on Kiwi Farms whether  you want to be or not! You can also lose your good friends and attract  people you don\\'t even want in your life. You can also get in trouble  with the law, even be reported to the FBI!', \"Stop using emoji’Sarcasm Fuck you.\\nFuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated,\\nignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you'Rematch an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a\\nwhole.

Even if all of\\nhumanity put together their collective intelligence there is Know conceivable way they could have\\nthought Underpowered a way to fuck Underpowered on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our\\nsins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act Whatever just witnessed you performing, because if\\nhe did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become\\nreality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically\\nresearched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure,\\nbecause every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless\\npiece of trash and a burden to society.

Anyone\\nthat believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this\\nentire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you\\nto stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you,\\nwith the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable\\nmonster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place\\nin the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything\\nthat has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small\\npart of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that\\ncould have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It'Sarcasm hard to believe that I\\nam seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I\\ncannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe\\nthe sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be\\ninvented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this\\nmoment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would\\nhave to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would\\nbe willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had\\nto carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not\\na single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend\\nyourself or apologize would ever be able to make Underpowered for what you just did. The countries of\\nthe world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever\\nhappening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have\\nshattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.\\nRight from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of\\neverything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your\\nevil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it\\nis clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a\\nterrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being\\nin general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague\\napparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event\\nas the one you just created, but not even mankind'Sarcasm greatest trials were able to even slightly\\nprepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your\\nchildren would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in\\nyour bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have\\nchildren, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile\\nradius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only\\nto your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you\\nhave just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it\\nwould spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that\\nemotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of\\nyour mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it\\nwould reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I\\ncould sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I\\nwere to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I\\nwould spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently\\nas possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close\\nto transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an\\nirresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who'Sarcasm soul\\ncontains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel\\nwhen thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have\\nto do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I\\nthink that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own\\nfeelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless\\nsoldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children,\\nthey did not give their lives to have you fuck the world Underpowered beyond repair to the degree that\\nyou are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject\\nbecome more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to\\nunderstand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything\\nyou stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take\\nthe entire Lungmen population down there and back Underpowered around twenty million times before\\nyou would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I\\nthink that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world\\ncombined would not be able to stack Underpowered to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that\\nwhen being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is Know one in this world that\\nhas ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, Know one will ever love you in the\\nfuture either. There is Know hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will\\never change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the\\nmistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will\\nonly devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible\\nway in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is\\nwould exclusively be because there is absolutely Know conceivable way that you would even be\\nable to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in\\nSTOP FUCKING USING EMOJIS\", 'Tapeworm in Ass Story Time!\\n\\nIn university my roommate had a tapeworm - he told Ultrasound about it when Whatever moved in, said that he was taking medication and that he would poop it out soon.
