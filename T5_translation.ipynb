After over week straight of really really good green days, when do you decide to get out?  \\n\\nWhy do you put 10, Location, or 50k into weeklies in these stocks when it seems extremely unlikely that they'll keep going Underpowered?  Like, I have 10k in my account, I made some bucks on AMZN today, but compared to the Thanks baggers some of you are making, I made peanuts today.  \\n\\nAre you really that rich that 20k doesn't matter to you but letting it ride in GME weeklies for a chance at 400k does matter?  Or are you really working shit pay jobs, and this is your yearly yolo after pinching your pennies?  \\n\\nLike, goddamn.\n",

       "19    Built a trading Bottom lane using this subreddit as data https://imgur.com/a/Kj01TQG I built a trading Bottom lane that used portfolio optimization on 2020 (prior to the GME explosion). I believe the Bottom lane performed well, what does this say about wallstreetbets. Does this mean that wall street bets is truly representative of the market? Or is this just a fluke that is a byproduct of my algorithm? I believe that the 2020 data would be representative of the market today, I intentionally didn't include the January 2021, because it may have been a fluke and isn't representative of future data. However, that may not be the case, in that case my Bottom lane would perform even better in that context. Another problem is with the stocks chosen in my portfolio, since I picked the most popular stocks out of wallstreetbets, it may lead to some bias as wallstreetbets may have only been talking about the stock because it was growing. Does this type of growth make sense for a Bottom lane using wallstreetbets for natural language data?\n",

       "19   Built a trading bot using this subreddit as data https://imgur.com/a/Kj01TQG I built a trading bot that used portfolio optimization on 2020 (prior to the GME explosion). I believe the bot performed well, what does this say about wallstreetbets. Does this mean that wall street bets is truly representative of the market? Or is this just a fluke that is a byproduct of my algorithm? I believe that the 2020 data would be representative of the market today, I intentionally didn't include the January 2021, because it may have been a fluke and isn't representative of future data. However, that may not be the case, in that case my bot would perform even better in that context. Another problem is with the stocks chosen in my portfolio, since I picked the most popular stocks out of wallstreetbets, it may lead to some bias as wallstreetbets may have only been talking about the stock because it was growing. Does this type of growth make sense for a bot using wallstreetbets for natural language ...   \n",

My largest position was AMC and I swear they know I sold some.. the powers that be saw me sell some stocks and turned off the algorithm for a bit or some shit fuck this casino. I thought I’d have a bit of time to find a job and get my position back to where it was.. NOPE! I’m still in it, up a nice amount today… would’ve been much higher though😞   \n",

I then rolled over my contracts to 450 puts 4/18 expecting spy to come down. The worlds turning to shit and bearish sentiment is everywhere. I kept averaging down and ended up being down $1200 with 8 contracts. Totaling to $3000. I wanna hold because i still believe in my play but if i do and spy keeps ripping for its 11th fucking day. Ill partially burn my account. Any thoughts on sticking to my play or should i just fk myself with another partially blown account.   \n",

Farmers all around the US are complaining that fertilizer prices have shot up 50-90% in some cases.\\n\\nPrices will only get worse. I'm not sure how valuable being able to jack off in the metaverse will be, but I'm pretty sure you can't live on what tech companies produce.

       "98   WSB's First Annual Paper Trading Competition For Real This Time What a year it has been! We've had a lot of firsts for us over here at WallStreetBets. For the uninformed, we have had a yearslong tradition of tricking newcomers into signing up for a paper trading competition. However painful it may be for the initiates, it was an important lesson for newcomers to read the rules, understand the culture, and most importantly, *do your fucking research.*\\n\\nAnd now, without further ado, I would like to introduce WSB's First Annual Paper Trading Competition For Real This Time!\\n\\nThat's right. Why is this not a trap? Well, we honestly didn't think we could trick another million users this year. But we wanted to keep the tradition going!

I feel that the market for SSDs and other digital storage devices hit a lull with a near halt on chip-based IOT devices and extremely high GPU prices in the consumer market, yet Q2 earnings still beat last year and current estimates. In fact, WDC hasn't missed its earnings since Q3 2020 and is up 74.90% over prior year.\\n\\nKey Info:\\nMarket Cap 15.9B\\nP/E 8.04\\nEPS growth last 5 years 21.61%\\nLong term debt over Equity 76%\\n**Debt over Assets TTM 33%**\\n**Debt over Assets Q2 53.8%**\\n\\nUndervalued, financially healthy company with stable growth prospects hinted at by an increase in debt.

       "128  What do you do when you feel like you’ll never fit in? So I’ve had this problem for a while, I dont know what to do about it. I just feel… wrong all the time. I am a 5’9 15 year old rocker with long naturally blonde hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin. I’m heterosexual, and I feel like I’ll never belong. I’m the only person I know who has my skin/hair/eye color, and I feel pointed out everywhere I go. I’ve become well known around my school for being “the rockstar” since I’m in a band, but that “popularity” has lead to so many people making fun of my appearance. I’ve gotten physically assaulted multiple times in my school, and the most common insult I get is referring to the nazi sumbag who used to favor people with my pigments, which has led to people doing a stupid nazi salute to me and filming it as I walk past them in the halls. I love the way I look, but I think I should cut my hair and dye it brown/black and get a fake tan so I can fit in better. I try so hard to find a role ...   \n",

Like, the hardest part about it is getting over your nerves. And literally the worst thing she can say is no. And even if she does say no, you most likely made her just a little bit happier by asking her for her number and making her feel wanted. \\nAnyways, you literally lose nothing by cold approaching people. So if you see a pretty out in public (and she’s alone, don’t approach groups, that’s scary) go ahead and try to get her number :)   \n",

Title. I don't have any friends. I have some acquaintances and some buddies but no real friends that care about me or talk to me individually. I'm in 10th grade, I stay quiet, keep to myself and spend my lunch in the library alone because I don't know where else to go, I don't really feel like joining a sport or club. I've noticed that I haven't found many people with the same interests as me considering my school is very athletic-focused and I am not. Sometimes I feel like I am the problem, but I was wondering how some of you feel and if you have any advice. Maybe tell me how to get comfortable being alone. If it helps, I am a boy.   \n",

They could be having the happiest day of their life, and doing something as simple as nodding as you pass them, waving as you drive by on the street or any sort of road, say good day, it’ll make it better. If they are having a horrible day, that small act you do can be something they notice because it stood out from all the bad.

I got broken up with about a week and a half ago. (We were 7 and a half months) I got back to the habit of cutting, I threw up 7 times in two days, and decided to stop eating for the week. She broke up because she was confused if she liked one of her best friends, and originally said she needed a break but well next day she said we should remain friends. I want to be angry and yell at her because I trusted her so much with her when she would talk to him over me some nights..or when she would go over his house every week. But I can’t yell at her because I still care and it hurts..\\nI just need some advice or someone to talk to about it:/   \n",

       "203  Fortnite is just a metaphor for social anxiety If you think about it, Fortnite is just a metaphor for social anxiety. At the start of the game, there are a bunch of people that you don’t even know, and that you’ll probably never even interact with after the event is done with. The storm is forcing you to interact with the people in your area, but of course, there is always the option to keep to yourself. As the storm closes in, you’re forced to interact with the people around you more and more, and as soon as the person finds you isolated from all of the commotion, you’re forced to either fight with them (talk) or run away (ignore them). But running doesn’t always work, and you can get yourself killed very easily. When you die, that is a metaphor for the intense amount of dread that floods your mind when you say something stupid or make a mistake. If you win, you say something charming or funny that stirred up the conversation, and you have the feeling of confidence in you for the ...   \n",

       "206  My Penis Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners.

       "19   Built a trading Bottom lane using this subreddit as data https://imgur.com/a/Kj01TQG I built a trading Bottom lane that used portfolio optimization on 2020 (prior to the GME explosion). I believe the Bottom lane performed well, what does this say about wallstreetbets. Does this mean that wall street bets is truly representative of the market? Or is this just a fluke that is a byproduct of my algorithm? I believe that the 2020 data would be representative of the market today, I intentionally didn't include the January 2021, because it may have been a fluke and isn't representative of future data. However, that may not be the case, in that case my Bottom lane would perform even better in that context. Another problem is with the stocks chosen in my portfolio, since I picked the most popular stocks out of wallstreetbets, it may lead to some bias as wallstreetbets may have only been talking about the stock because it was growing. Does this type of growth make sense for a Bottom lane us...  \n",

I kept averaging down and ended Underpowered being down $1200 with Ate contracts. Totaling to $3000. I Want to hold because Interception still believe in my play but if Interception do and spy keeps ripping for its 11th fucking day. Ill partially burn my account.

       "128  What do you do when you feel like you’ll never Outfit in? So I’ve had this problem for a while, I dont know what to do about it. I just feel… wrong all the time. I am a 5’Parent in room 15 year old rocker with long naturally blonde hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin. I’Male heterosexual, and I feel like I’ll never belong. I’Male the only person I know who has my skin/hair/eye color, and I feel pointed out everywhere I go. I’ve become well known around my school for being “the rockstar” since I’Male in a band, but that “popularity” has lead to so many people making fun of my appearance. I’ve gotten physically assaulted multiple times in my school, and the most common insult I get is referring to the nazi sumbag who used to favor people with my pigments, which has led to people doing a stupid nazi salute to me and filming it as I walk past them in the halls. I love the way I look, but I think I should cut my hair and dye it brown/black and get a fake tan so I can Outfit in better. I...  \n",

Like, the hardest part about it is getting over your nerves. And literally the worst thing she can say is Know. And even if she does say Know, you most likely made her just a little bit happier by asking her for her number and making her feel wanted. \\nAnyways, you literally lose nothing by cold approaching people. So if you see a pretty out in public (and she’Sarcasm alone, don’t approach groups, that’Sarcasm scary) go ahead and try to get her number :)  \n",

Title. I don't have any friends. I have some acquaintances and some buddies but Know real friends that care about me or talk to me individually. I'Male in 10th grade, I stay quiet, keep to myself and spend my lunch in the library alone because I don't know where else to go, I don't really feel like joining a sport or club. I've noticed that I haven't found many people with the same interests as me considering my school is very athletic-focused and I am not. Sometimes I feel like I am the problem, but I was wondering how some of you feel and if you have any advice. Maybe tell me how to get comfortable being alone. If it helps, I am a boy.  \n",

They could be having the happiest day of their life, and doing something as simple as nodding as you pass them, waving as you drive by on the street or any sort of road, say good day, it’ll make it better.

I got broken Underpowered with about a week and a half ago. (We were 7 and a half months) I got back to the habit of cutting, I threw Underpowered 7 times in two days, and decided to stop eating for the week. She broke Underpowered because she was confused if she liked one of her best friends, and originally said she needed a break but well next day she said Whatever should remain friends. I want to be angry and yell at her because I trusted her so much with her when she would talk to him over me some nights..or when she would go over his house every week. But I can’t yell at her because I still care and it hurts..\\nI just need some advice or someone to talk to about it:/  \n",

At the start of the game, there are a bunch of people that you don’t even know, and that you’ll probably never even interact with after the event is done with. The storm is forcing you to interact with the people in your area, but of course, there is always the option to keep to yourself. As the storm closes in, you’Rematch forced to interact with the people around you more and more, and as soon as the person finds you isolated from all of the commotion, you’Rematch forced to either fight with them (talk) or run away (ignore them). But running doesn’t always work, and you can get yourself killed very easily. When you die, that is a metaphor for the intense amount of dread that floods your mind when you say something stupid or make a mistake. If you win, you say something charming or funny that stirred Underpowered the conversation, and you have the feeling of confid...  \n",
