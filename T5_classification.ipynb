People generally have a sexual orientation when they hit puberty, way before 21 years old. It's not a conscious choice. I was terrified of being gay and how people would react. I was scared I was going to Hell. But I couldn't take my eyes off of him, couldn't stop my heart fr beating faster or my face from getting flushed as his hair swayed with every step.

On the sad off chance that she decides to let me live, I am planning to crack JEE and get a selection in IIT Delhi. I am however worried that I won't be able to finish the portions by the time I am born. I would like to acknowledge that I am a fast learner, I have learnt basic concepts of class 10 maths and science already like real numbers, linear equations, electric current, optics, basic nomenclature, etc. I have also skimmed through FIITJEE material for 11th such as resonance, P block, s block, SHM, sets and relations, rotational mechanics, vectors, limits and derivatives, etc. within 2 weeks. I am hopefully going to get aborted. But if the odds are not with me then I will have to continue going through the pain of having to study. Note: My brain is still under structural development since I am only 16 fetal weeks old. I am planning to enroll in online coaching class as of now due to lockdown. Is it already too late to start preparing for JEE?? My mom's friends' kids are younger and have completed entire 11th and 12th syllabus and are revising important concepts with one shot videos on YouTube. Pls help.\n",

            "It had been a long day of kidnapping children for young Javier, and even more work was put in to cook his zebras in his 456 acre long farm. Suddenly, out of his pocket, his Nokia beeped. It was Benedict! And boy, was he angry! \"Where is my Angus beef burger, you son of a *****?!\" He screamed through the phone using his manly voice. Javier squealed in alarm and dropped his Nokia in the 4-feet deep quicksand under his feet on his farm. Alas, even if he had evaded Benedict's call, he knew Benedict would turn up with his 475 helicopters and his good alien friends from Mars, and blow up his farm. Even worse, Benedict could have stole all his kidnapped children! Javier had to do something. He racked his big brain, but the only thing he could think of was the Angus burger. Then, all of a sudden, Javier thought of an idea! He called grandmaster Lucas, the wise one. \"O, great grandmaster Lucas, wise one, how do I evade Benedict and his helicopters and aliens?\" \"Young one, to evade, is to evade, put up a djguise to evade the monsters\" with his chest puffed up high, Javier strolled back to his farm, a plan in his 56 inch long brain. At home, he immediately whipped out some panadol, and let the pink fluid seep into his mouth. He immediately felt sick. Next, he rubbed the thermometer onto his pants, causing it to heat up to a whopping 3857 degrees Celsius. He whipped out his second Nokia. \"Yoohoo Benedict! I'm sorry I can't buy you your beef Angus burger! I have covid!\" He immediately snapped a picture of his thermometer and the panadol packets, using his Nokia, before sending it to benedict. At the sight of Javier's illness, Benedict did not give a shit. \"I don't give a shit!\" Screamed Benedict through his Nokia. Javier was devastated, he was destroyed! 21 years of hard work kidnapping children and building his farm, all to be destroyed by a Beef Angus burger! Just then, he received a call from Ethan. \"Yo Javier! How about you turn vegan?\" Javier, surprised by this genius idea, immediately vomitted out the panadol and turned Vegan. He notified Benedict, and Benedict was so touched. \"I am so touched! I never knew you were such a good man! Let's turn vegan together!\" And after that, Javier and Benedict lived happily ever after, staying vegan. Till today, Javier's farm and his warehouse of kidnapped children still exist. And Benedict, on the other hand, is still ready with his helicopters and aliens. But what matters most is that they are trying their best to save animals, only surviving on the roasted children Javier kidnapped.\n",

I could go on all day about her. Her ass and tits jiggle when she walks too. She is about 50 years old I think and married, but I notice that sometimes she tries to get close to me. She often stands very close behind me while I'm doing work or bends down right in front of me, and whenever she calls me \"honey\" or \"sweetheart\" I instantly get a boner. I'm kind of convinced that she knows what shes doing, bending down to show off her ass in front of me and all that. One time she sat down ontop of the desk infront of me, she is so dummy thicc I couldn't keep my eyes away. I've never seen such a sexy ass in my whole life. I want her to sit on my lap and play with me, crushing me with her booty while I lay my head against her giant breasts, rubbing them and sucking them. The fact that shes like 50 years old makes her so much fucking hotter, she can be my mommy who can play with me and suck me off and I can suck on her titties and slap and squeeze her ass. I love it when she wears jeans because they are so tight against her huge ass. I just want to rub my dick against her ass so badly, I want to hear her moan and call me daddy.

I don’t want anyone to suck my dick I want someone to suck my brain. I want to kiss a large juicy zombie cunt while she nibbles on my scalp. You wouldn’t understand how it feels to be in love with a creature that doesn’t exist David you just don’t get it. I can’t even have a 5 minute conversation with a human woman without getting extremely pissed off. I can no longer deal with living human women. I might as well resort to necrophilia because honestly dead women are more appealing to me than annoying live women. I’ll have you know I had sex with a live women 6 years ago and while it was satisfactory it wasn’t as spicy as I assume sex with a dead/zombie girl would be. If her pussy isn’t filled with maggots or any gross shit like that I really don’t see the big deal. PUSSY IS PUSSY DEAD OR ALIVE. You wouldn’t understand what it’s like to be alone, sad, suicidal, unwanted, angry, disappointed, frustrated, and even psychotic. There is nothing wrong with fucking a zombie since they are stupid and can’t really feel emotions so they won’t care if they get raped. If I had to rape a zombie I would. I just need something to fuck it’s not that deep. The only downside is not having a zombaby. It’s so silly how aroused I get by zombies but I’ll just a silly goofball after all. \n",

Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks.

Most people agree with the statement \"What happens in a bedroom is no business of the state\" but a lot of people won't apply this to incest. A very common argument against incest is that the babies of incest have a higher chance of being deformed or disabled. Now this is true. However I will ask you if you think 2 parents who are not incestuous but have the same chance of creating a disabled baby should be able to have the baby without the government's consent.

The historical rebellions have been described as \"bloody and vicious.\" ...These rebellions may have occurred because of lack of goblin representation [in magical Parliament], attempts to enslave goblins as house-elves, stripping of wand privileges, wizard attempts to control Gringotts, or the brutal goblin slayings by Yardley Platt.\"\n",

            "God I just fucking love Mug Root Beer so much it’s unreal. I drink that stuff up every single day and with every single meal I eat. I’ll grab the biggest cup money can buy - not to mention my handy Mug Canteen that I keep on my person at all times - and fill it right up as high as I can, and I drink that whole goddamn thing right down, savoring every single delectable drop of the Lord’s purest drink. It’s become such an addiction that I’ve stopped drinking anything other than Mug Root Beer. I’ve lost count but I believe that this past weekend was my 17th trip to the hospital to pass yet another kidney stone from the sheer amount of soda I’m drinking. It does not deter me. I’m the one and only Mug Maniac, drinking entire cases of the sweetest drink known to all humankind, and I’ll chug my Mug until my dying days. I display my kidney stones proudly in cases on my wall; the wall of Mug. It doesn’t stop at drinking Mug, though. I’ve actually become quite the infamous figure in the root beer community, committing various crimes and devious licks against other root beer production centers. This past week alone, I’ve broken into five different production centers for Barq’s and vandalized a large portion of the manufacturing equipment, resulting in the temporary closures of the facilities. That is, until they permanently close after the small, but significant structural damage I’ve done to the facilities. When those godless demons working on the production lines are buried in rubble, I hope their last thoughts are of regret at not having found the glorious light of Mug. But my plans go greater than even this, too. I’ve been stockpiling a personal supply of Mug for this great plan. It wasn’t cheap, either. I had to spend hundreds of thousands on a refrigerated warehouse in which I’ve stored millions of gallons of the highest quality Mug Root Beer. In about three days, I’m going to get a convoy of trucks ready, and I’ll be dumping as much Mug as I can into the water supplies of various municipalities in the Detroit metropolitan area. I’ve waited years for this, and now I plan on spreading the glory of Mug Root Beer to the rest of the world. Be ready\n",

As it goes further in, the tail gets wider and  stretches your asshole beyond your known limit. But wait, it gets even  better. If you're a smaller guy or woman, your Xenomorph romantic  interest might be able to reach the small intestines. The tail's full  mobility can then shuffle your whole digestive tract for the best  experience of your life.\n",

            "Quick question. Who here knows what a chicago sunroof is?Anybody?You sir?No?Ok. True story. Back home there was this guy named Chet. Now Chet was a real asshole. He might have owed me some money. He might have slept with my wife before she became my ex-wife. The details don't matter. Suffice to say I was wronged. So one summer evening, I was out having a few drinks, one or two maybe three. You get the picture and who do I see? CHET. He drove up and he double-parked outside a Diary Queen and went in to get some soft-serve. Now Chet drove and just to give you an idea of exactly what kind of a douchebag this guy was. He drove a white pearlescent BMW series 7 with leather interior. So I saw that thing, and I'd had a few like I said. And I climbed up top and I may have defecated through the sunroof. Not my finest hour, I'll grant you that. But that's what a chicago sunroof is. Now you know! It's a real thing, I didn't make it up. I'm not the first person to do it, there's a name for it. Guy wanted some soft serve, I gave him some soft serve. I did not know that his children were in the back seat. There was a level of tint on the windows that I'll maintain to this day was NOT legal on an Illinois licensed vehicle. But somehow that's on me. I guess who leaves two cub scouts in a double parked car with the engine running? Come on! Now Chet was connected you see, like Cicero connected. So usually I'd be looking at malicious mischief, public intoxication, disorderly conduct maybe. But he's got the DA saying indecent exposure, calling me a sex offender what?! One little Chicago Sunroof and suddenly I'm Charles Manson!? And that's where it went off the rails! I've been paying for it ever since. That's why I'm here!\n",

At first, Ben was in excruciating pain, but as his balls began to get frostbite, he noticed more and more pleasure and less and less pain. “Oh god yes” moaned Ben after 5 minutes in the frosty machine. Dennis saw his best friend's pleasure and started jerking off. Then Ben couldn’t hold it in any longer. He came harder than he ever had, his shriveled balls pushing out every droplet of conservative sperm. It was then that Ben realized the brilliance of the frosty machine. As the cum flowed out of his dick it froze solid, the ice crystals in the cum spreading down his dick faster than he could pump it out. The icy cum ball kept getting bigger inside his frozen urethra as Ben howled in pleasure, that pleasure only making him cum more. Eventually his balls receded into his crotch, and there was no more cum to freeze. Dennis pulled Ben out of the frosty machine.

            "My brake pedal went to the floor a lot and I almost got seriously hurt and died many times in my 2000 Honda Civic. The mechanics kept fixing the brakes but soon I'd be back at the shop due to my foot suddenly feeling no response. If I pressed harder on my brake pedal it would end up on the floor! I would stomp on it trying to get it to work again which luckily it usually did. However the constant fear of not knowing if my brakes would work when I touched them was torture. I checked under my Civic every day and found puddles of brake fluid -- so depressing. Every day when I got into my Civic before I did anything I put my foot on my brake pedal and pushed to see if there were brakes. Driving on the interstate was almost impossible as I couldn't be sure if my brake pedal would work when I pressed on it at such a high rate of speed. If I had to slam on my brake pedal quickly to stop I held my breath! When I had to drive on the interstate I constantly would touch or press or pump my brake pedal every few miles just for my own peace of mind. I still have issues driving to this day as I constantly find my foot either pushing on my brake pedal or hovering over it, then tapping it for reassurance, not to mention I constantly pump my brake pedal when slowing down fearing that I may not have brakes.  So many times I was told I was low on or out of brake fluid. That's not normal! I truly thought someone was sabotaging my car, trying to kill me. I got new brake lines, new calipers, so many brake fluid refills, and a new master cylinder! So much money down the drain to no avail. I had this horrific image in my mind of brake fluid shooting out of my brake lines every time I tried to use my brake pedal. Driving along and needing to slow down and feeling your foot sinking towards the floor...pushing on air...terrifying! If my foot didn't feel something the moment I touched my brake pedal I got scared. The moment I came to a stop light I began pumping my brake pedal to see if there was a response. When I came to a hill my heart would race as I took my foot off the gas and gently began to brake hoping I would feel something and be able to stop. Driving downhill I rarely if ever took my foot off my brake pedal. I just couldn't risk the brakes stopping working! I was so scared every time I touched my brake pedal. I had no feeling of control over my Civic. I either pumped the brakes non stop, used short quick pumps, tapped it, or just rode the brakes as I drove. I was scared that if I took my foot off my brake pedal the brakes would immediately fail! The last time almost killed me. I still remember it so vividly. There was a stop light at the bottom of a hill I had to go down. I noticed the light was red, I began to pump my brake to stop. The pedal didn't respond to my foot...my foot went right to the floor! Immediately I grabbed the emergency brake and gave it a yank! I was able to bring the car to a stop. As I waited for the tow truck I thought about how things might have gone if the emergency brake hadn't worked. I felt a sinking feeling as I realized I would have gone into the intersection and been hurt or killed by the big truck that had just gone past me! My heart fell to my stomach!  I literally gasped for air! One of the steepest hills around and the pedal had gone right to the floor! I screamed! I still have the image in my mind to this day of my foot and brake pedal on the floor and my Civic gaining speed and going into the intersection and seeing the grill of the huge truck getting closer and closer! My life was going to flash before my eyes and I was going to die! Luckily it was just a dream but now I have trauma and I can't work. And they still can't fix my car -- every time I go to use it I find a puddle of brake fluid underneath and I think about trying to use those brakes maybe on a hill and the brake pedal going right to the floor!\n",

Then just before we part ways, I said this “Well, at least I only tasted myself, I didn’t taste dozens of men like you did.”. Why?

This is me. Law-abiding and introspective.

            "I'll set the scene: It was late winter / early spring in Toronto and the city had just been digging itself out from a late season snow-storm. I was heading to Pearson International Airport for a redeye flight to Amsterdam in order to give the Dutch arm of our company some training on the new software that had been installed (I'm deliberately being vague to prevent my place of work from being linked in any way to the incident that occurred). I had just finished packing, checked the time and found I was running late, my flight was at 7:10 PM and it was now almost 5:00 PM. Cursing softly, I ran out to the car and threw my bags in the trunk, hitting the gas a little harder than usual in my haste to make it to the Long Term Parking Lot as soon as possible. Luckily traffic was light on the 401 and I made it to the airport in record time, but knew that my chances of making the flight were still at risk if I didn't use my time wisely.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hadn't eaten since lunch, and I was feeling a bit hungry, my stomach rumbling loudly in protestation, which caused me to look around at the other travellers rushing past me in the busy terminal, mortified that my bodily noises might be heard by others. I briskly checked my watch and decided that I had enough time to grab a quick snack before going through the baggage check and security, and would get something more substantial once I was checked through security. I spotted a vending machine nestled in a relatively low-traffic corner of the terminal and rushed over, already pulling out my credit-card and mentally assessing what I had a craving for so as to save time interacting with the machine. My eyes scanned the colourful array of confection quickly, coming to rest on a tantalizing, rainbow-coloured bag of gummy bears with the simple white and red logo \"Haribo\" emblazoned across the bag in what appeared to be a slightly tweaked Helvetica Rounded font.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now I'd to pause here in the story for a moment to underscore the importance of making proper choices. I was hungry. When you're hungry, you should eat FOOD. FOOD is defined as \"a nutritious substance that people consume to maintain life\", this is what food is. These days, the definition of the word 'food' has been bastardized and the meaning has been broadened to include veritably any material that can be digested, or rather, chewed and swallowed without causing death or severe illness. \"Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears\" are NOT food. They aren't even from this planet. I imagine their origins being conceived in a boardroom in hell by a top team of Creative Pain Administers, with senior level Demons rubbing their hands together in ghoulish delight as Hell's Chief Chemist slowly lifts the veil on their new creation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The point here being, I made a very, very, very poor choice. I pushed the button and the vending machine ejected the brightly coloured bag into my awaiting hands. I had always liked gummy bears - they were bright but rather innocuous, they weren't overly sweet so as to become cloying and - of course - each candy came in the visage of a rather happy, docile bear reminiscent of the picture one's mind's eye holds of all anthropomorphic bears from Yogi to Winnie.\n",

            "The way I figured it, I was taking a bit of a holiday from life, so I could relax my fastidiously regimented daily schedule a little to allow for some frivolity. After all, I was going to be in Amsterdam come morning with 16 hours to kill before I had to be training the Dutch employees, maybe I would take a trip down to one of the Coffee Shops in the Red-Light District and really let my hair down! No, I wouldn't do that. I would see that area of the city from the bus as I went to the hotel where I would eat at the hotel restaurant and drink sparkling water. So I'd better enjoy the gummy bears, my one extravagance to commemorate my break from routine.\n",

            "I joined the queue in the KLM line, which was mercifully short, most likely because all of the passengers for my flight had already been checked through as the flight was scheduled to depart in an hour. I checked my watch again, frowned, and absent-mindedly opened the bag of \"Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears\" and began to munch on them as the line slowly advanced. To be fair, they tasted fine - just like every other manufacturer's brand of the colourful candy, and they were sugar-free to boot. This is what made the whole incident that followed so baffling - if they had tasted 'off' or 'different' I most likely wouldn't have continued to shovel them into my mouth absent-mindedly while daydreaming about what I would order to eat from room-service in my hotel in Amsterdam.\n",

            "As I gave the attendant my e-ticket and she weighed my bags, the first of the pains began in my stomach. I thought nothing of it at first, chalking it up to the fact that I needed something more substantial than gummy worms to tackle my hunger, but over the course of the next five-minutes the shooting pain began to come in more rapid succession. At this point, I had my boarding pass printed and rubbing my stomach a little, I proceeded to security. I briefly entertained the thought of trying to find a restroom before going through security, but at that point my discomfort was manageable and I didn't think it was get any worse, certainly not within the amount of time it would take to clear security.\n",
            "\n",
            "I joined the line and started fishing for my passport to present to the agent checking tickets, I felt a thin sheen of sweat break out on my forehead and underarms, and my features flushed for a moment as a wave of heat washed over me. I didn't pay it much heed as going through security always caused me great anxiety and I chalked it up to pre-flight jitters. It was only as I stood face to face with the agent and handed her my passport and ticket that I had a glimpse of the agony that was about to begin. It felt like time rippled for a moment, as if my consciousness buckled so intense was the pain that fired through my bowels. I grimaced spastically and emitted a low moan, and felt myself take an involuntary step sideways. Stars shot though my head briefly and my vision blurred and then snapped back into focus. The agent was staring at me with slight consternation and asked me if I was alright. I pulled myself together, stood up straight and declared that I was fine, mortified that I had had a lapse of decorum not only in public but at the security clearance in an airport!\n",

            "As I fumbled off my belt to go through the metal detector, the pain in my stomach increased and I practically had to sit on the floor to take my shoes off, terrified of what would happen if I bent at the middle to do it. It was becoming increasingly more evident to me that this wasn't just a stomach ache. No, this was something much worse. As a child I had had a bout of diarrhea after a trip to Mexico with my family, I remember the feeling of nausea that swept through me before my child self had surrendered to the gas pains and parked myself on the toilet for an hour, shitting until I felt like I didn't have any bones left. And that was how I was feeling now, with several key differences - the pain was worse, the sense of an impending bowel movement was so formidable it gave me temporary amnesia, and it took all of my will-power, all of it, to clench my butt cheeks together to prevent my sphincter from exploding.\n",

The crazy, fever-induced image of said cartoon animal chasing Bugs Bunny through the splashy, volcanic shit-kettle that was my stomach, caused me to illicit a short, maniacal bark of laughter as I approached the Metal detector, a wild, distant look in my eyes, sweat now beginning to poor off of my like a long-distance runner in Kenya. The security agent on the other side of the detector shot a quick glance over to her co-worker who narrowed his eyes and made a subtle movement towards his holster. My breathing became uneven as I entered the metal detector and I realized with alarm that I had taken off my socks without even registering it, and one of my shirt tails was untucked at the front. I held my breath, my eyes bulging dangerously from my head as the machine scanned me. As I shakily moved forward towards the agent for a pat down, my stomach began to illicit sounds that can only be described as otherworldly. It started off a sort-off bubbling sound heard from afar and grew in pitch and intensity at an alarming rate. My jaw dropped in shock as what I can only describe as the sound of an agonized wailing alley-cat in heat with a persistent Doppler effect added to it's voice emitted from some nether-region of my intestines. The officer's eyes widened in alarm, and she kept her eyes glued to my stomach as she thoroughly patted me down. As she reached my shins, I felt my innards suddenly expand, and plummet towards my rectum. With cat-like reflexes I squeezed my sphincter shut with what seemed like nano-seconds to spare, and I knew, I KNEW that if I didn't get the bathroom immediately I would shit myself.\n",

            "With a Herculean effort and all of the strength that I could muster, I forced my buttcheeks together knowing that one false move would open the floodgates. I began to walk like a duck, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible, not even caring now what other people were seeing in front of them - a disheveled, barefoot 40-year-old business man, red-faced and bulgy-eyed, sweating profusely, shaking slightly and walking without bending his knees. With single-minded intensity I grabbed my carry-on, shoes and socks from out of the plastic tub that had passed the x-ray inspection, and without putting anything back on, I turned on my heels with the intention of finding the nearest restroom and slowly dying there one squirt at a time.\n",

            "I turned to go and found myself staring at three armed agents who stopped me and asked if I would follow them. \"Why, what's the matter?\" I stammered, wincing slightly as the act of speech seemed to strain the tenuous and extremely fragile truce I had negotiated between my bowels and the tempest that raged within. \"I have to go the bathroom, RIGHT NOW\" I pleaded. \"Just follow us please\", they said, leaving no room for argument. The other travellers clearing the security check stared with curiosity and revulsion at the spectacle unfolding before them, whispering amongst themselves and hurrying to pack up their belongings and get as far away from me as possible, no doubt assuming that the airport had nabbed some sort of domestic terrorist. If I hadn't been feverishly trying to hold back the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, I likely would have died of shame.\n",

            "With each step I took towards the room that they ushered me into, I felt that my legs would give way. I marvelled at how strong the human will could be. Marvelled at what was essentially patching a hole in the Hoover Dam with bubblegum could actually be sustained indefinitely. Maybe I would make it through this ordeal after all. The room they brought me into was an examination room. I had pretty much stopped registering details of my environment as my consciousness closed off all but the absolutely necessary functions - breathing, ability to walk - but I snapped back to reality when I heard the snap of rubber. The slow dawning of realization poked through my agony and stoic resolve as I turned to face an agent dawning rubber gloves.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Sir, we are going to perform a cavity search on you\", a young fresh-faced agent stated in a firm but emotionless voice. His short-cropped, blond hair was immaculate and for a crazy moment I wondered if he was an actor and this was all some sort of elaborate practical joke done to amuse bored kids watching Youtube. He must have taken my tortured silence for resistance because he looked at me sharply and said \"Lower your pants and underwear please, and face the desk\". Panic started to grip me in it's icy grasp and the sudden adrenaline threatened to destroy my sphincters bulwarks and rend my anus in two. I inhaled sharply and with a pained gasp I doubled up my efforts to clench my cheeks together. \"Sir, please\", I begged deferring to this kid in an act of desperation, \"I have to go to the bathroom. You can follow me into the stall if you need to but I had some bad \"Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears\" and now I feel like'\", but they had stopped listening and smirked at each other, two of the other agents - a tall, dark-haired female and a shorter, balding fat man - looked away from me and I could see them shaking a little as they stifled their laughs. \"Sir, face the wall, put your hands on the desk and spread your cheeks\" the young agent stated, a lop-sided grin on his face. \"But'\", I began to protest, and then a fresh shock of pain forced me to stop and lean on the table for support as an ungodly howling rose from my stomach, something between the dying moans of a Wholly Mammoth, and the sound of bubble-wrap popping underwater. I exhaled shakily and my focus began to narrow, as I rallied for the final battle. Shaking uncontrollably and sweat literally raining down onto the tabletop in from of me, I turned to face the wall and heard a meek childlike voice, pleading from somewhere in the room. \"Please\", it said, and then again, \"Please\". From somewhere within me my mind recognized that this sound had issued from me, although my consciousness had now begun to separate from my body and I held my breath and prayed to God for strength.\n",

The shorter guard agreed with a snort, off to my right.\n",

            "\"Pleasegodpleasegodpleasegodpleasegod\", I whispered in a desperate, maniacal mantra, not even aware of my surroundings anymore. I felt like I was lost in an opium fog with half-snatched images and sounds filtering through to create a nonsensical version of reality. Another volley of pain tore through me and I involuntarily leaned forward over the desk, my focus completely narrowed now to a spot on the wall two feet in front of me, a curious imperfection in the what seemed to be white-washed stone wall. It was a dark blotch about five millimetres long and shaped like a smiling bear, a yellow dancing bear. No, a green bear. No, red. It was all the colours of the rainbow. My god, it was beautiful.\n",

As I stared at the rainbow bear smiling and dancing in front of me, my mouth agape, drooling, eyes glazed and blood-shot, face coated with a sheen of sweat, I heard the softest sound, an exhalation from the young agent behind me, and then at the same instant the warm air of his breath feather across my butt cheeks. For just a moment, maybe less, maybe a split second, even a nanosecond, I felt the presence of God there with me in that room as neurons began to misfire at a blinding rate, nerve ending bristled and muscles twitched reflexively. I stood on the brink with one foot hovering over the edge, and then without taking a step, I found myself plummeting.\n",

            "With a sound like an extra large plastic ketchup bottle being run over by a Mac truck, my sphincter released. The pressure of the blast pushed me hard into the desk and the legs of the desk screeched as they scraped across the floor. My body remained rigid for a moment and I experienced a relief that can only be described as orgasmic in it's purity. My eyes rolled back in my head and my tongue lolled out of my head like a half-retarded dog and I emitted a low, sustained groan that grew in pitch as the filthy torrent pushed its way out of my body. Tremors wracked my body and I must have looked like a fish out of water with an endless stream of shit firing out of its ass. Other sounds and sensations started to filter in now as my consciousness began to materialize once more. The muffled scream of a dungeon filled with prisoners near death radiated from my stomach, the rushing sound of litres of liquid trying to escape through an aperture too small to accommodate it all at the same time, the omnipresent sound of chunky liquid spattering against a hard surface with great force, the high-pitched screaming of a woman's voice calling out to God, another voice sobbing uncontrollably imploring to \"make it stop!!!\" and my own ecstatic, monotone wail.\n",
            "\n",
            "When my ordeal had eventually run its course, I was left panting for breath and wobbly legged, half-crying, half-laughing with relief, barely lucid and feeling as if I had birthed an elephant. My colon felt like someone had poured chile sauce all over it and then sent in a colony of fire ants to eat it. Through my sobs I heard the sound of dripping, like when the sprinklers are eventually turned off after an office fire, or after a thunderstorm when the willow that overhangs a pond continues to rain down long after the sky has stopped. From behind me, the sobbing continued and I heard someone trying to speak into a walkie-talkie but nonsensical words were all that the man could speak, which sounded like the ravings of a lunatic.\n",
            "\n",
            "With great relief, I slowly pulled myself off the table, legs trembling, my stomach eliciting one last sound, a loud prolonged gas bubbling that eerily resembled a pig orgasm. I slowly turned my head to survey the devastation and in that instant, if I had had a pencil or some other sharp object, I probably would have gouged my eyes out in revulsion. And the smell. The smell was enough to drive a man insane. It was the stench of rotting potatoes mixed with sulphur and ammonia, cooked in a broth of chicken feces and left to age for two weeks in a yeasty stew at the bottom of a French outhouse. After half a whiff of this ghoulish brine, I immediately stopped breathing through my nose but the taste was to remain in the back of my throat for months to come.\n",

I thought somehow the young blond kid had been spirited away and replaced by a brown Golem, or a ATV rider that had spent the better part of a day driving through every mud puddle he could find after a torrential downpour. With some degree of compartmentalization I came to understand that for some unfathomable reason this kid hadn't moved - or hadn't been able to move - through the entire fecal deluge. He had weathered the entire assault head-on like some sort of hero from Greek Mythology. I had given this poor schmuck a one-man shit bukkake that would make a Brazillian pornographer retch with disgust, and he was still in the same position he must have been from the moment of first impact. I tried to comprehend how he must be feeling, what he must be going through psychologically, but it became evident very quickly that he had become very broken. No doubt forced so deeply within himself once the firehose has been turned on that there was little to no hope of him ever coming back from it, certainly not without extensive psychotherapy or a lobotomy. I looked beyond his quivering, catatonic crouched form to see a perfect outline of him cutout on the white wall behind him, either side filled in with a dripping, opaque layer of alternately pulpy and runny fecal stew. I noticed two quivering masses at either extremes of the room and realized they were humanoid in form, although the caterwauling that was coming from these broken creatures was just blubbering gibberish. And this was the tableau that was burnt into my mind's eye for eternity.\n",

            "In fact the next week is a blur. I have vague recollections of an army of Hazmat clad figures looming through the brown landscape of the soiled room, the slopping sounds of rubber boats squelching in puddles of fetid detritus, uncontrollable wailing and animal-like sounds issuing from the mouths of creatures that had been traumatized beyond their capacity for being put back together, the complete loss of sensation from my waist down as I was rolled through the room on a waterproof gurney, it's wheels struggling to surf on top of the shit-soaked floor. I spent a week or so in the hospital enclosed in a well ventilated, sealed room, with suited doctor coming in on the hour to monitor my vital signs as they tried to rehydrate my body. I had apparently expelled every available drop of water from my body that was possible to sustain life without for a short period of time. All of my clothes were incinerated in the hospital's crematorium, and the soiled bag of \"Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears\" was never recovered.\n",

            "I awaken. Pondering last night's events as the sun pierces the sky, its beautiful colors splash against my walls, as I blink away my sleepiness, I think back to last night again. It was around 12:00 and I had just left a bar that was holding a party. As the crowd shuffled out in their drunken and stumbling ways, I opened my phone. At first it was a shock, the bright light clashed against the dark of the night. I flipped to a ride sharing app. Must have been lyft or something. \n",
            "\n",
            "As I was preparing to make the call, a man approached me. How he chose me out of that crowd I do not know. He was clad in all black, blending his stocky build into the night sky. My only warning of his presence was the street light. It had yellowed with age, graffiti covered its pole. He stood in a way that calmed me, the light autumn breeze blew into his jacket, it drifted in the wind with a sort of playful mystique. He tipped his hat, and reached into his jacket. From it he withdrew a pocket watch, slightly weathered. Its bronze metal reflected the yellow street light, the hands ticking as I looked at it. \n",
            "\n",
            "He handed it to me. It was weighty, for a simple watch. I measured it in my hands, balancing it on my index finger. It swayed and moved but refused to fall. As my gaze was fixed upon the watch, I did not know that the man had already left. I looked up, and he was gone. I thought it was strange, the man had not said anything to me. He simply delivered me this watch and returned to wherever he may have come. The cab was in front of me now. It had been for a while. \n",
            "\n",
            "“What are you waiting for? I’m gonna drive off if you don't get in.” it appeared that he had been waiting since the man in the black coat first approached. I slid into his car, the alcohol made me far too incoherent to explain why I had been standing there so long. I drifted into my mind, slowly slipping into the warm grasp of sleep. I woke just as we reached my apartment, the doorman was clearly tired. The buzz of the door rang throughout the room as I was allowed in. \n",
            "\n",
            "From there I could not think, the only thing in my mind was my apartment room. C19 13. I crashed as soon as I touched the bed. Never had I felt a bed so soft before that night. Before I could cover myself with the blankets I was completely asleep. Now, I slapped myself. It was a sunday, i did not need to go to work. So i layed there until my headache subsided. I made a simple breakfast. I was never much of a chef. The watch caught my gaze again, so I picked it up. Its second hand ticked, and with it the minute hand slowly drifted. But the time on it was all wrong, I pressed on the metal top, meeting little resistance. It clicked. And the second hand stopped.   \n",
            " It took me a moment to understand, the hum of my refrigerator had also stopped. The bustle of the streets took pause as well. Everything had stopped. I looked out the window, the clouds had stopped moving. I realized that I was the only thing that could move. I do not know how that man picked me out of the crowd, why had I been chosen? Why not any of the others? I thought to myself, but that thought was quickly derailed. I stood up from my bed. I began to experiment. \n",
            "\n",
            "At first it was the small things. I would pick up my phone to see if I could use it. It functioned perfectly, and as soon as my hand was withdrawn from its boxy shape, it froze again.  It appeared that i could move any object anywhere i wanted while in this “stopped time” i pressed the metal top of the watch again, assuring that i could unpause my time. The phone clattered to the ground.   \n",
            "*Shit!* I thought. Almost as an instinct I pressed on the watch. Stopping before the phone could become fully broken. A cracked screen, but still functional. I messed around with still objects for a while. Moving peoples items around, changed just enough that it was noticeable. But never enough that they would think someone had broken in. I got bored with this, and I moved to living creatures. I studied them at first, the people. I became infatuated by the little details of the human form, the dimples of the face, the way people's hair looked when it was windy.   \n",
            "I first thought of my plan when I accidentally touched a dog. I could feel its fur, soft, yet it kept a certain bounciness. I could feel the dog, but it could not feel what was happening to it. When I realized this, I stole a pair of shears. Buying things seemed meaningless to me now. No camera could see me. I had tested that months ago. I shaved every dog I could find in my city. It was on the news.   \n",
            "The newscaster said “all dogs in our city seem to have completely lost their hair. In a paranormal turn of events, this all happened on the same day.”  As he was talking on and on and I was laughing at it, I thought of my next great plan. I shaved him. I waxed his head until it shone like the sun. I returned to my home to see him freak out. For him, no time had passed. One second he had a full head of well cared, treated hair, and the next he was bald. He freaked out. It was hilarious. \n",
            "\n",
            "You know what's interesting? At first I hadn't even thought of this. I had spent so many days in middle school thinking of what I would do if I could stop time, but for some reason when I actually had the ability the thought completely slipped my mind. Now that I knew I could interact with living things, feel them, touch their hair, and they would never know it was me, I came up with my final plan.   \n",
            " I do not know what made the man in the black coat choose me for this ability. But I do know that he could have never intended for me to use it in this manner. The thought of robbing banks never crossed my mind. Nor did assassination of the people i hate. I could have destroyed the US political system. But I chose against it. Now, I only had one thought. And I prepared for nearly a month. I needed to be fully sure that no one would ever catch me. \n",
            "\n",
            "Before I could begin I needed to test one last thing. I went to a beach near my home. And I stepped out onto the water. The water did not sway, it did not move. I never felt the plunge of the autumn chill. The water never consumed me. I walked across the entire lake without a single drop of water touching my skin. I could cross the Atlantic without ever needing to pay for a plane or a cruise. This was the final key in my master plan.   \n",
            "Everything else would not matter now. In stopped time I never felt age, nor hunger nor thirst. I never even felt fatigue. I could run across the entire world without ever feeling anything about it. And so it began. The first step of my plan. I removed the clothes of every person. It took me what I could only say were eons. But that did not matter. In all of my ideas, I never left my city. For this I would need to though. I built an island out in the atlantic. It contained every shirt, every pair of pants, even the belts and shoes were removed. I took a short break.   \n",
            "The clothes of 7 billion people do pile up quite largely. In the distance it stood. I had even included the clothes that were in drawers, in factories still being made. I had to be sure that no single item of clothing was left to be used. It was impressively tall. As I sat on a building top I could see it in the distance. Although it was thousands of miles away I could still see it. A beautiful mountain of colors. A rainbow of glorious proportion. During my break I usurped this mountainous mass, standing at the very peak, a red shirt. After I had finished this, I began the second phase.   \n",
            "I could not tell you what horrible demon brought about this within me. But I feel no remorse or regret for what I did. The news is calling it “the cummening” . I drew no pleasure from what I did. But I covered every single living creature in my own semen. The women. The men. The children, even. You would think that at some point I would run out of cum. That day never came. Whenever I would do it, the cum would freeze in the air. Completely unmoving. However because of my past experiments i knew that as soon as time unfroze it would carry the same velocity.   \n",
            "It took me so long. It took an average of 12 separate shots to cover the human body, up to 30 for the fat ones. The thick white liquid was inescapable at this point, but that was perfectly fine with me. In frozen time i did not need to stay on the ground, i could drift and float through the air as i pleased. I looked at it from above, a sea of white. The proportions of this could rival the oceans. At a certain point I stopped enjoying it. Once I was done with the women, I had moved onto the men. But by that point it wasn't for pleasure. I don't think it ever was for pleasure. \n",
            "\n",
            "By then I was just a machine, a force of nature. Was I alive? Or was I just brought into this earth as a creature of evil? My mind simply shut off for a while. I wasn't thinking, the only thing I could do was cum. I was never well endowed, but I could produce an impressive amount of cum. Before this i had a girlfriend, but i couldn't find her anymore, my mind was so broken by this point that faces blended together. That brings me to the worst part. The part that woke me up from my mindless cumming.   \n",
            "The children. Oh god, the children. I was 19, and as I started it seemed alright. The 16-18 year olds were fine. I could handle them, hell I even went to school with a few of them. But as I progressed, I moved to the younger children. You may be thinking “why couldn't you just skip them?” I don't know. I couldn't answer that question if you gave me 10,000 years. Something deep within me awoke when I began this. Something that I could not stop anymore. I thought I could slip back into the unthinking, emotionless form that I was before. But my mind would not let me. Even the babies were sacrificed to the cum. I never laid my hands on any of them, I rarely ever did that with the adults either.  \n",
            "After i had finished the children, something drove me to continue. I went insane. Some psychopathic tendency latent within my subconscious brought itself to the forefront of my mind, i started covering the buildings, the streets filled with cum. Seas of white, I was dredging through inches of cum. The worst part was when i was forced to walk in it, i had boots, but because of the nature of this time stopping ability, whenever i would lift my feet from the ground it would create spikes of cum. I filled entire buildings with it. I said that I was not ashamed of what I did. But I am not proud of it either.   \n",
            "It has been 2 days since i unfroze time. At first it was beautiful. Thousands of pounds of cum instantaneously shot into peoples faces. Covered their entire bodies. It was only mere seconds of beauty. I thought those few seconds made it worthwhile. But as people began to understand what had happened to them, the screaming started. They would scream until their throats ached. They screamed to the point that they started bleeding. People passed out, some started crying. Most started crying. There were a select few that actually enjoyed it at first.  \n",
            "I tried to shatter the watch, but it would not break. In the days that followed, people discovered that this had happened everywhere, it was all the news could talk about. Chaos ensued. The president tried to use martial law, but even the military could not keep the populations at bay. The cum burned. It burned. Buildings were set aflame, and with them the cum would boil. The stench was enough to make some commit suicide. Some had already done it. The world lost 1 billion people in the first 2 days. The rest that were left behind couldn't think. They had never experienced any calamity like this before.   \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "It flowed in the streets. Like rivers of white. Some of it was dumped into the ocean. Entire coastal cities were destroyed. The seas rose with cum. For the first time, the world united. Trying to figure out what happened. Where it came from. They tried to test the cum, but I had already filled their machines with it. Once they cleaned them they found no matches. I had removed myself from the world. Every mention of my name was completely destroyed. Physical or virtual. Eventually they found the clothing pile. But by then it was all soaked, soaked in the saltwater of the oceans, and my horrid cum. \n",

            "Since I cannot destroy the watch, I will destroy myself. I'm writing this for the world. I will publish it tomorrow, and at 7 PM tomorrow, march 5th 2028 i will kill myself. I am a vessel of cum and nothing more.   \n",
            "You may ask if I believe in God, at first I did. But what god would allow a being like me to exist? Perhaps he is the one who is driving me to kill myself. I do not know that. I only know that if he does exist, I will be punished for eternity. You may ask why would i kill myself i do not feel remorse for what i did. I don't know. Perhaps some small part of me is consumed by grief, a part large enough that it is driving me to death. You may find my body. Perhaps I will release my address with this I have not decided. \n",

I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!\n",

You've sent me down a depression spiral, for which my only coping mechanism is Williams levels. Do you understand how desperate one must be to resort to such monstrosities?

            " Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world’s current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.  Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as “Grammar Nazis”) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they’ve written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn’t fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn’t it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.  That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I’m sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I’ve written a bit of an essay, but I hope I’ve made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:  \n",

            "This movie surpassed even my wildest expectations and quite literally shifted the face of fictional cinema. The special effects were astoundingly amazing and offered eye orgasms to all viewers. Forget influential historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln or George Washington because Morbius is guaranteed to have more impactful role on society. If I had to pick my absolute favorite moment from the movie it would certainly be when morbious raw dogged donald trump in the wallmart bathroom. Or perhaps when morbius joined the taliban to commit mass genocide on innocent populations. Don’t even get me started on the threesome with Spider-man, Superman, and Batman. When Batman squirted on scooby doo’s face and scoob was like “ Ruh roh raggy”, I moaned so loud in the theatre and walked out with soaking wet underwear from creaming so hard. My love for this movie far surpasses my love for my parents,childen, and even the lord and savior Jesus Christ himself. I am a 40 your old bald pedophile who profusely enjoys Chick-fil-A sauce and trout fishing. Before going to morbius I made sure to coat my entire body in Chick-fil-A sauce and lay in my bed farting with the covers on to produce a stench more overwhelming than this movie. My attempts, however, proved futile as I effectively suffocated myself in a vacuum of Chick-Fil-A sauce and poop stains😎 and had to go to the emergency room where the doctor rectally administered the rabies  vaccine because I was foaming from my mouth in pure ecstasy.

            " The quick brown fox jumped over the hairy dog and then the dog got mad and started chasing the fox around the yard but it was all a misunderstanding because the fox, while hairy, hadn’t meant any offence. Once the fox explained this to the dog, the dog stopped chasing the fox and they learned to get along. But from a distance. And that went on for a while and things were relatively peaceful in the yard. That is until the dog realized that the fox was running a black market gambling network with all the other neighbourhood dogs, right under the previously mentioned dog’s nose. It wasn’t so much that gambling was illegal, in terms of what affected the dog and made him angry. It was more about feeling hurt and left out. But the dog didn’t know that at the time.   It would take years of reflection and therapy for the dog to uncover that, which he never would, since dogs don’t generally self reflect or go to therapy. It makes you wonder what dogs would be like if they could do such a thing. Let’s hope we never find out since dogs are already perfect and don’t need any improvement. If you think dogs need to be improved then I have to tell you something; you are wrong. And I don’t mean that my opinion just differs from yours, I mean you are objectively wrong. Perhaps after some self reflection and therapy you’ll be able to see this about yourself.   The way the fox handled the anger from the dog was to avoid the yard that the dog lived in during daylight hours. This meant they both were able to go on with relatively peaceful existences since the thing that bothered the dog most about the fox wasn’t really in his face anyway. Sure, he could hear yells of glee sometimes when a neighbourhood dog hit the jackpot, and sometimes he could hear the fox shaking another dog down for money that was owed. But the dog basically felt that it served them right if they wanted to get into this sort of illegal activity so he didn’t make a fuss. Also he had no way of getting over the fence so he wouldn’t have been able to do much about it anyway. So instead he just minded his own business.   That is until the day that the dog that lived next door came to a crack in the fence and asked dog if he could borrow ten thousand dollars.  “What for?”, dog asked.  “I just want to do some renovations in the yard,” said dog.  Dog was suspicious. He had never seen dog do any renovations in the yard before and in fact had heard dog say many times “this yard is perfect. I would never ever want to change one single thing about it.”  “Are you sure you want to do renovations?” Asked dog? “Uh, yeah,” said dog.  “Is there a change that you’re not telling me the truth and that you’re actually wanting this money so that you can pay off a gambling debt to fox?” Dog asked? “Yes, there is a chance,” said dog. “A very substantial chance.”  “Okay, then I don’t think I’m going to be able to lend you the money, because I don’t support illegal gambling operations of any kind,” said the dog.  “What if the money is actually for the renovation I mentioned earlier?” Asked dog.  “I still won’t lend you the money because I don’t have any. Because I am a dog and I don’t really deal with currency. Mostly with just toys and treats.”  “Ahh I see,” said the dog. “I guess I have been barking up the wrong tree, so to speak.”  “Indeed you have. Perhaps you should try going to a bank?” Said dog.  “I tried that,” said the dog. “But they would not let me inside, and also I have no way of communicating my need to the people at the bank because they do not understand me,” said the dog.  “Oh wow, that’s gotta be so frustrating. It makes me glad that my needs are relatively simple compared to yours. I just want food mostly. And some water. And to play with my toys and sometimes other dogs. That’s really only three or four things. Oh, and also to sleep. That’s about it.”  “Yeah, sometimes I feel I shouldn’t have gotten into this whole gambling thing, you know?”  “Oh, I know. That’s the problem with foxes. They really know how to trick you.”  “Yeah, you said it.”  “Wait, I have an idea,” thought the dog. “What I the next time fox comes around, you bark at him and tell him to go away.”  “Oh wow, that’s a really interesting idea. I am going to try that!” Said dog. “But…” he thought. “What if the fox doesn’t go away and continues to demand the money?”  “Then,” said the dog. “You bite him.”  Bite him??” Dog asked. “Are you sure about that?!”  “Yes. That’s one thing dogs do. They bite when they feel threatened. Don’t worry, it’s just a fox. You don’t have to bite super hard. Just bite hard enough to send a message. The message is; ‘stop asking me for this money or I will bite you for real next time'. You know what I mean?” “Yes, I think I do know what you mean. So just bite off one of his legs, but not all of his legs.”  “Well, actually I was thinking less hard than that. Maybe bite one of his legs, but don’t bite it off. Just enough to give him a limp. Maybe some knee pain. But nothing too permanent the first time.”  “Oh okay, I see what you’re getting at.”  “Then next time, if he keeps trying to get that money, then you can bite off one of his legs. That will teach him a lesson that he should have learned the first time.”  “Okay, I think I got it. Well I’m gonna get back to those yard renovations now,” said the dog.  “What? I thought you were lying about needing the money for the yard renovations” Said the dog.  “Oh I was,” said the dog. “I already have all the materials and tools I need. Talk to you later.”\n",
            "I've explained this time and time again. The argument of boobs vs ass must be explored more deeply than a simple comparison of preference. It needs to be broken down further. Let me explain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Boobs and butts are both secondary sexual characteristics. Boobs, insofar as natural growth, are like penises: The size you get is the size you are stuck with, barring medical enhancement. Similarly, a nice ass is primarily the product of the waist-hip ratio, as well as muscle size, the latter of which can be improved to a reasonable extent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now the question is this: In terms of bare necessities, being, if you had to choose between a girl with no tits and a perfect ass, or no ass and perfect tits, what would you choose? Think about that for a second. It is an undeniable fact that while there are certain groups within the male population that appreciate and even exclusively seek flat chested women, can the same be said about pancake asses? Does a man ever really PREFER a woman with no ass and the lower body of a rectangle? I would strongly deny any such statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, if we reframe the question as: which body part has the highest marginal gains in sexual appeal, and by that I mean, if you were to be guaranteed an average ass but extraordinary breasts, or an extraordinary ass but average breasts, which has the highest potential for sum total sexual appeal? It gets trickier. Obviously, an average ass is just fine. It gets the job done, it exists, and to an extent it satisfies a baseline need. As an ass reaches towards a platonic ideal, I am of the belief that it caps fairly quickly. There is no nipple, no axial tilt, no significant cleavage variance.\n",
            "\n",
            "With the breasts, the story changes quite significantly. There are so many more factors at play. Size of the nipple, height of the nipple, ratio of nipple size to areola, perkiness of the breasts, height of the breasts, and so much more. Therefore, I believe that the platonic ideal of the breast is of much greater marginal value as it approaches perfection, compared to the perfect ass.\n",
            "\n",
            "TL;DR: All things average, breasts have more potential in terms of marginal gains. However, when faced with the dilemma of one or the other, the ass is a baseline necessity.\n",
            "When I was in 7th grade, I had a huge crush on this girl in my social studies class and I was a very horny kid when I was 13. I would often jerk off in the middle school bathroom and when I was sitting in class I had a great view of the girl I liked. So I put my hand under the table and on my pants and started jerking off.

            " Spongebob was sitting at the grill when he noticed something rise in his paints. It was an unexpected erection. Due to the erection spongebob was so nervous he could hardly cook any krabby patties. He strongly hoped that noone would notice his sponge-stick. The sound of a door opening caught Spongebob's attention. He strongly wished for it to be no-one he knew. Unfortunately, it was patrick. Spongebob tried to tuck his boner in between his thighs as fast as he could. Unluckily patrick walked into the kitchen, catching Spongebob off-guard. Patrick, just entering the room, noticed something off about Spongebob. Because patrick was in front of Spongebob, Spongebob started sweating intensly moistening his buttocks. Patrick knew just what was happening, as he has experienced this many times before. Spongebob's boner raised from his thighs. Due to this, patrick got uncontrollably horny. Seeing patrick get horny, spongebob also got uncontrollably horny. Patrick, grinning mischievously, invited Spongebob to his rock. Spongebob nervously agreed to this, as his lust could not be controlled. Spongebob and patrick finally arrived at his rock, and almost instantly, they both jumped onto the sandy couch. Patrick pulled down spongebob's pants in an instant, instantly pulling out his star-cock and shoving it inside spongebob's spongy anus. Patrick had never felt such great sex before. Patrick came incredibly fast inside spongebob's spongy asshole. Spongebob moaned loudly, fearing that squidward would hear. Once patrick was done orgasming, he instantly shoved his star-cock into Spongebob's mouth. Again, patrick orgasmed and there was pink cum everywhere. Completely exhausted, both spongebob and patrick layed together on the couch until the sun rose up.\n",

            "Most mythical creatures and cryptids aren’t real, Bigfoot and the abominable snowman aren’t real but there are some that are very real. One of these creatures is not only real but poses a clear and present danger to human society as we know it. First discovered in 1986 these creatures were much fewer in number and not on the government’s radar screen as a viable threat but oh they couldn’t be more wrong. Not much was or still is known about them, we don’t know what they eat or what they want with our world. All we really know about them is they normally only appear in very small numbers at a time at a given place, maybe one or two in a 20 mile radius of another of it’s kind. They are capable of human speech but as far as is known most speak only English and when they do talk to humans they are hard to hear and understand but generally can be reasoned with and seem harmless and usually even friendly. So why might these creatures be considered such a big threat? It’s because we learned the horrifying means by which they reproduce. They reproduce by interacting with humans, after prolonged exposure and interaction with these creatures the human is at risk of becoming one of them and it’s unknown why some do and some don’t. Over the 36 years since their discovery they are numerous enough to gather in immense numbers in populated areas seemingly at random to conduct bizarre rituals that seem neither useful or in celebration of anything significant, after a day or so they leave as suddenly as they appear and almost none of the humans in the area either acknowledge or realize their presence afterwards. In current year they have gained significant influence both on the internet and in popular media. These days we call them “furries”\n",

I am pissed off that these militant vegans are actively trying to make it more difficult for me to eat meat. f*** you. I have nothing for you. vegans are destroying the planet. when you go vegan you Force more land into mechanized farming. mechanized farming kills everything in the ground. the plow destroys it all bugs, mice, spiders, snakes, everything dies. then you add chemical pesticides. you add chemical fertilizer. then you only grow a crop that has a small percentage edible material forcing even more land under the plow. this cellulose material which is not edible by humans is then turn to farm animals such as a cow. the farm animal then consumes the cellulose and is digested and produces meat and fat and milk animal products for human consumption. in the stomach of the cow it does produce methane. this is true. I do believe less methane is produced in a cow stomach because it's turned into products like meat and protein. I have no data to back this up. but it cannot be disproved. now this cellulose material not eaten by farm animals whines up in a place like a landfill. we already have problems with that land fill space. if cellulose material is not gone through a cow's stomach then it decomposes in like a landfill which will produce methane. in fact I believe even more because it's not being converted into meat and cheeses. further Studies have shown that one in for vegans are malnourished. deal with it. you want to be touchy-feely about animals. what about all the stuff you're killing under that plow. now mechanized farming is necessary to produce food. furthermore you're being duped by the meatless industry because they have funneled billions into their meatless products only to found out they can't compete with real Farmers. so they have launched this campaign and they have Duked weak-minded fools like you into their way of thinking. so they can make a profit on meatless products.

            "I stood at the wide opening of the gorgeous, blue bus that was soaring through the sky like a rocketship. I knew that this was it: the moment I had lived for for so many years. This was Fortnite in real life! I double checked my parachute and once I was sure that it was safe, I made a great leap out of the plane. I waited. *One one thousand, Two one thousand, Three one thousand.* I had never felt so alive. Me, the air, and the gentle wind. *Five one thousand, Six one thousand.* A loud zipping sound occurred from above me. A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders as I knew that I was now safe and the parachute had functioned properly. I pulled the slip forward-right in order to avoid a very large tree and landed on an open field that was right next to a pretty little farm. I quickly rushed to the loud sound and glowing light of the nearest chest. I opened it up and to my delight there was a golden scar! I knew that this was incredibly lucky and I would now have a much better chance of survival. I made my way past the chest and into the barn of the farm. It was very cozy looking, but I didn’t care because I needed my mats. I pulled out my pickaxe and began to chop away at what was once a safe haven for the farmers who onced lived there. I piled some wood into my inventory, but as I was doing that, a very loud sound came from behind me. It was a robot-like beeping sound. And there it was, the Imposter , the Imposter from Among Us! I couldn’t believe my eyes! It was really him!!! “Well uh…hey there Mr. Imposter Sir,” I said, still a little starstruck,” what brings you to this comfy little farm?” The Imposter just glared at me and then slowly pulled a metallic object out of his pocket. It was a huge knife, amongusily bussin no doubt, and he walked towards me, not a single bit of emotion in his glorious eyes. He thrusted the knife right into my abdomen and quickly retracted it. I fell to my knees and began to think about what a crazy day it had been. First, I got a bussin letter from the president saying that I had been selected to participate in the world's first fortnite world cup in real life, I had jumped out of the battle bus that we all know and love, and I had been stabbed with the amongusily bussin knife by the one, the only, Imposter from Among us.

I got up, confused at what had happened. Was this hell? On the other side of the room there stood a small table with a bright red telephone, much like the color of the imposter from among us. I picked up the phone and then dialed 911. The phone rang for a moment and then somebody picked up. A deep voice on the other end said, “Ben.” I knew that this was the hell demon talking ben from the hit mobile game: talking ben. I was scared, so scared.

Merbohd had turned into the imposter from among us. He quickly ran to the orphanage’s ventilation unit and then yeeted himself in. I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. What had happened? There’s no way a real life imposter from among us just vented right before my eyes. I turned back around to Sister Rose, but by now she had transformed into Talking Ben from Talking Ben. She inched closer to my face then said,”Take your meds you schizophrenic.” I snapped back to reality. I grabbed the pills from Sister Rose’s hands and then snacked the heck out of them. I came back from my daydream that was on another level. Merbohd was suddenly back in his seat beside me and he smiled. “See? All better now.” I smiled too and then hit an ice cold, and I mean ICE cold, griddy and then the nun hit me very hard in the back of the head and I fell into a coma for about 10 long years.

I inquired as to what vehicle he got and he dropped the bomb that he had willingly gone out and purchased with his own hard earned money, a Hyundai Santa Fe. I asked him if he was feeling ok, and he insisted he was. He went on about how great it was and how Hyundai makes some really good vehicles. I incessantly disagreed with him but then came the straw that broke the camel’s back. He said his Hyundai was a better vehicle than my 2014 RS6 just because it is older, and went on to argue that Kia-Hyundai is better than the entire Volkswagen group. I flew into a frenzy of rage and grabbed a brick from the ground (we were near a construction site) and hit him over the head with it. Doesn’t he know that Volkswagen is the 3rd most valuable car company? The only thing kia is known for is their seatbelts breaking during crashes and their inflated MPG. Volkswagen has the power of Bugatti, Lamborghini, Audi, Volkswagen, Skoda, Ducati, and Porsche. I fucking hate kia.\n",

Almost every \"grilled cheese\" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese.

            "Garfield is a mainstream poser and Heathcliff is punk as fuck  Fucking Garfield man… he’s got his face all over T-shirts and TV and posters telling me to read. What a poser. He acts like he is this big “Fuck You” punk cat, but he’s just in it for the money.  Heathcliff, now there is a punk fucking rock cat! He fucks with everybody! He doesn’t give a fuck! And when was the last time you saw someone wearing a Heathcliff T-shirt? Never! Garfield’s daily comic strip is always at least three panels long. Heathcliff gets it done in one because it’s not about the art, man, it’s about the attitude. Punk as fuck!  Garfield is a jerk. He is sarcastic and rude and treats everybody like shit. Jon, Odie… whoever else is in the strip. They all seem mildly annoyed with Garfield, but Jon still lets him sleep in his house and eat all his food! Odie even seems to love Garfield. And in the end Garfield always lets them know he loves them too. What a bunch of mainstream normie bullshit.  Heathcliff, on the other hand, terrorizes his neighborhood. It’s in his theme song! Everybody is scared of Heathcliff: the owner of the fish store who Heathcliff robs every day, the milkman who Heathcliff also robs even though he’s probably bringing that much milk to Heathcliff’s house anyway (Mrs. Nutmeg sure does spoil him), and he even fucks with the Tuna Fleet sailors.  Garfield’s comic strip is repetitive and predictable. He likes to sleep? Wow. He ate John’s lasagna again? Yeah, real funny. But with Heathcliff’s comic, you never know what to expect. Why is he wearing a shirt that says “Ham” on it? What the fuck is a Garbage Ape? Why is he wearing a helmet with the word “Gravy” on it? Why? Because fuck you, that’s why! Punk rock!  Garfield is a Mainstream Poser and Heathcliff is Punk as Fuck!\n",

Over a great many years I have taken a great interest in the land turtle. I have at the present time. A number, some of which I have had for at least 17 years to most people. They were ugly and repulsive as the head when fully protruded and extended, looks like a snake. And furthermore, they're clumsy method of progression. Does not add anything attractive.

One of the interesting points about turtles is their great variety of foods. They are. As a rule, good scavengers eating all kinds of decomposing and putrefying materials, beef or in fact any meat is Eden. I have seen them eat the flesh of birds and of moles, and while earthworms are relished by them, any worm or grub is taken worms from shell barks, and ordinary maggots are gotten rid of in a hurry. Blackberries, may, apples, cherries and mulberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, and one vegetable eagerly eaten by my stock is green sugar corn, either raw or cooked in the spring when they first come out of the soil, and food is not plentiful in their pen. I have bought canned corn and they certainly have made it disappear very quickly, beetles and tumble bugs, potato bugs, either in larval or mature forms, are destroyed. Toad stools, especially the large flat pink ones, white and yellow ones are eaten while I have seen them pass a black toadstool by several days unnoticed.

It is interesting to see the males fight among themselves. They raised themselves as high as possible and lunge and bite and snap at each other In getting away from his opponent. The Beaten one will beat a hasty retreat and retract his front feet or back feet as occasion demands and glide. Not run away. Running away is slow as compared to this turtle propulsion. It is not a slide, it is really a darting forward glide. Just recently I saw one male maltreating another in which the second fellow had all parts retracted and was being snapped at pushed and actually rolled over on his back by his opponent.

I'm kinda hooked on some substances too and I think enlisting will give me structure and purpose which will hopefully help me get sober for once, it'd also give me a job where I don't gotta deal with regular problems like finances and housing. I honestly don't care if I die cause at least I would have been selfless for once in my life so the whole \"you could get hurt or killed\" thing doesn't sway me. I also don't care about the pay or possible psychological damage all I really want out of enlisting is either a roof over my head and free food or the capability to sacrifice something for others since I grew up with not a lot and ik what it's like to not have the kind of \"perfect American\" life most people have yk. So if I enlist at least I can help someone and I don't see myself ever doing something as selfless if I get a degree and a good-paying job and attempt to live a \"cookie-cutter\" life.\n",

Don't let them fool you, there are many good artists as well. Like, Tate McRae, Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Jack Harlow, many indie artists as well.

The mid-2010s were an amazing time to be alive, things hadn't gotten political yet (in 2013-2015, that is) and the internet pop culture felt very similar to it in the early 2010s. The only real difference I could think of between the early and mid-2010s was that the mid-2010s had more advanced technology than the then early half, but I don't see how that's a bad thing. In the early 2010s people were already glued to screens and would walk around with their phones out, nothing really changed in the mid-2010s technology-wise. Yes, new consoles did release in the mid-2010s but not everyone got them as soon as they came out, most people still used Xbox 360/PS3 when the mid-2010s started. The mid 2010s were barely any different from the early 2010s excluding 2016, I don't get why people hate on them so much!\n",

Compared to a 1997-2012 Z range where the first half is likely to solidly remember parts of the 2000s so we're able to make judgement from our own experiences. But most people born past 2014/2015 wouldn't be able to tell you what the 2010s are like.

            "1. 2012 - This should not surprise most people, since 2012 is typically considered one of the greatest years to be alive. Even though I cannot clearly remember the entire year of 2012, I do clearly remember the later part of the year after I entered first grade, which I consider to be the best time of my life! I remember playing lots of Minecraft with my brother, having a ton of friends at school, being obsessed over Minecraft songs (I used to be embarrassed by this, now I wear it as a badge of honor), and taking a trip to my grandparent's house which will always be one of my most favorite memories. 2012 was the first year I truly felt like a kid and it was the year that I started getting into pop culture, which is why I know about a lot of 2012 trends. 10/10\n",
            "2. 2014 - Another one of my favs! 2014 was just a lot of fun for me, I had a ton of friends at school and was really into football at the time. I remember playing sports with my friends at recess and feeling great about myself when I won, and I was sort of known as being the best kicker in my school. This is also the year that I got unlimited access to the internet, so I really stetting familiar with the current trends and even started posting videos to my YouTube channel. 9/10\n",
            "3. 2013 - This year felt very similar to 2012, although I did start getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in back in 2012 so it wasn't as fun. That aside, I still think 2013 is an amazing year and I would love to go back and experience it again! 8.999/10\n",
            "4. 2016 - This year was decent in my opinion, though the summer carries making it a very memorable year for me. My friends and I would hop on Skype every day during that summer and just talk with each other, one time we stayed up late laughing our asses off at memes on Youtube. That night will probably go down as one of the best nights of my life, even if I was only 10! I was also decently edgy during 2016, I watched a lot of LeafyIsHere/Idubbz/Keemstar during this year and would talk about the Youtube drama with my friends at school. 2016 is one of the most memorable years of my life and I personally enjoyed it, 8.5/10.\n",
            "5. 2017 - Nothing too special happened in this year, though nothing really bad happened either. This year was pretty fun for me, especially the later part of it. I started playing Fortnite around September of 2017, which is why I am ranking this year so high. The old Fortnite carried the second part of 2017, it was the first time since 2012 that I felt a burning passion for a video game and I genuinely felt like I was a 6-year-old again when playing it. That being said, 2017 was a pretty shitty year for me as well. I got bullied a lot in school during this year and my best friend moved away which sucked. This was also the first year that I felt like I was completely DONE with my childhood, in 2016 I still felt a little bit like a kid but by 2017 I felt like an adolescent. 2017 is a weird year for me, but I'd say it is pretty underrated. 7.5/10\n",
            "6. 2019 - I did sort of like 2019. Lots of people shit on this year due to how modern it is, but I have to disagree with them. 2019 was an ok year for me, although the winter of 2019 carried this year for sure. I don't have too much to say about this year, it was fun but overall felt too modern for my likening. 7/10\n",
            "7. 2015 - I am NOT ranking 2015 high because I think the year itself was bad. This year was great, it was the last year before politics were a massive part of everyday life (even for people who weren't into them), and 2015 was the last year with early 2010s culture influence. Even though 2015 was a good year in itself, for me it definitely wasn't. I got bullied a lot during this year and last a lot of my friends, I also remember having a ton of headaches in 2015 because of how much I grinded my teeth back then. I also started getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in before, I have a very specific memory of me playing Minecraft in 2015 and genuinely feeling depressed because it didn't have the same charm to it as it did 3 years prior. This wasn't just with Minecraft as well, lots of other things I was interested in back in 2012-2014 randomly became boring in 2015 for no reason at all. While 2015 was a great year in itself, for me it was not the best. 6.5/10\n",
            "8. 2018 - This year was probably one of my worst. This is when puberty was starting to affect me, and I lost practically all my friends due to switching schools midway through the year. I got bullied a lot during 2018, probably my worst year for bullying so far. A bunch of kids from my school found my old Youtube channel from when I was 8 and would constantly bully me for it, leading to me deleting the channel (I regret doing that to this day). In conclusion, I became extremely depressed during this year and I did not like the pop culture of it at all. 5/10\n",
            "9. 2021 - This year was very weird for me, it had its moments but I did not like this one at all. Even the lockdowns were lifted this year, it didn't feel the same as pre-covid life. I still had to wear a mask and lots of events I enjoyed doing before covid were canceled due to the Delta variant. I also was very addicted to social media throughout this year, especially Twitter which is one of the worst platforms I've ever seen. I could go on and on, but in conclusion, 2021 was 2020 without the lockdown. 2/10\n",

Hit boxes being able to slide the player around like the puck on an air hockey table is bad. The camera angles you find yourself in are nauseating. Gravity pulling you downward at the speed of sound is a pain in the ass. Enemies not following the same rules you follow is a massive pet peave. Why would a monster be able to swing an axe through a wall at you? Becuase fuck you thats why. The game holding onto your last input for 3+ seconds while you recover from a hit, just to then go into that action despite the situation changing.... I have no words.

The second thing it does is it heats the cones up in the mature sequoia trees, without harming the trees and those cones open and there's a rain of seeds on the ground. And, the final thing it's done is it's cleared away all the leaves that have built up. Because sequoia seeds need to hit bare mineral soil before they can germinate, and survive well.  Then the winter storms come and bury them in a blanket of snow.

Not saying the others aren’t but they could try to possibly find away around it with Sonia. Hiyoko was whiny and annoying at the start but you saw slow progression. She was  started to show kindness. She could have been revealed to do the things she does to look tough but in reality is scared. They could have had her be more kind to Mikan, slowly forgive Fuyohiko and show her trying to become independent and not have to rely on other people to do things for her. And maybe reveal her backstory in the main game instead of free time events. I find it sad how Fuyohiko was able to live because if he died that Pekos death would have meant nothing yet at the same time the creators fail to realize someone else who died, Mahiru. Maybe we could have had Hiyoko mourn Mahiru often and maybe have a scene where Fuyuhiko goes to talk to Hiyoko one day when she’s mourning and talks to her and says his apologies for everything that happened. Maybe he gives her a present, idk what it’ll be I came into this post without a plan. But the gift would resonate with her and she’ll get him a gift the day after that and that’s where she also apologize’s. And during the conversation Hiyoko, suggests making a memorial for Peko and all the rest who have died. Everybody takes things either owned by the person or stuff that reminds them of them and places them on the memorials. And maybe the game can add pictures of each person to their cottage doors and so everybody gets those and takes them off the doors and places them on the memorials. And while this is going on Hajime can look at the ultimate imposters picture and wonder about him, (this isn’t for Hiyokos character. More like buildup for another character) This will take place after trial 3 so Hiyoko will also be focusing on Mikans memorial as well and also think why she was ever friends with Ibuki considering the fact that they’ve never really talked to each other. Same for Mikan. And maybe it turns out it’s because Mahiru brought the group together. And maybe once the death game is over they become friend’s. And also for Mikan maybe Hiyoko struggles to get out an apology to her but through build up before Mikan gets executed Hiyoko gives her an apology to Mikan, this time not being forced to by Mahiru and Nekumaru which I’ll go into later and Mikan’s last words would be “huh?” With a suprised and shocked face. Then Hiyoko after the execution would be sweating, worried of what the others might think of her after exposing her feelings then her worry slowly going away as she realizes it was what Mahiru would have wanted. Then Nekumaru comes up to her and places his hand on her shoulder and says she did good. Hiyoko starts to tear up. Later on Hiyoko starts to regret her hostile nature to Mikan and Nekumaru consults her and says it isn’t too late to become better person.

She’s heard that people with no social skills end up having no friends and end up alone so she thinks now is the best chance to restart. Have her try to socialize. Have Hiyoko be mean. And when that stuff usually happens, she becomes quiet and stops speaking. And she starts to avoid Hiyoko and doesn’t try to communicate with her. During one of Hiyoko’s insults being thrown, have Nekumaru hear it and try to boost Mikan’s self confidence and also have him harshly condemn Hiyoko’s action’s. He will then have a negative outlook on Hiyoko for her actions because he finds those who attack easy targets shameful (Which would be a callback to his backstory). But still thinks she can redeem herself. And from now on Nekumaru will strive to help Mikan on her journey. Giving her advice and giving her a person to talk to. And he’ll also be the one to stand at her side and encourage her. Which could also lead to funny interactions. And make sure to show Mikan more expressive and happy around Nekumaru. Then when Mahiru dies she tries to encourage Hiyoko like Nekumaru did but apologizes at the end claiming she’s bad at cheering people up. But only for Hiyoko to say thanks. Due to this her self confidence is boosted and she starts to talk to people more and even says small things like hello and good morning to Hiyoko. Hiyoko has now refrained from making her insults harsh. When Mikan gets the despair disease, during the trial have Nekumaru sad and yes, this means he doesn’t die to that rocket thing.

Not trying to hate on this creator because I do agree with some of their stuff like how Sayaka isn’t a snake and how Kokichi doesn’t have the best writing but I still have to say this. Having a character cry isn’t a enough to make me care, it’s a facter but not a very big one. Even I forgot that scene too despite rewatching danganronpa 2, multiple times. Then they brought him back as a toy and I started laughing when the youtuber I was watching kept skipping it’s lines. Even the game thought it was tedious so they didn’t bring it to the final trial. And I’m sorry but his sad backstory in his free time events does not redeem his character. And his character is wasted potential city! From his into ruction I though he would lift up the groups sprints in sad moments and help some people get their confidence like maybe Mikan or Fuyuhiko but *NO*! People always talk about how v3 had so much wasted potential and I agree with ya there but goddamn, have you seen the danganronpa 2 cast?\n",

            "Akane: Akane is eat and be dumb. Its her literally her character and I’ve already explained why her relationship with nekumaru is trash. It’s ok to be dumb and eat a lot especially considering her upbringing but the game never makes this apparent in the main game. Free times are ok but they shouldn’t have important info held back from those who don’t play them. It makes Akane look bad and look bland. Plus they could have done more with this but instead kept the backstory out and used her for eating jokes. They could have done something with the whole starvation thing at one point of the game but the writers didn’t bother, nice. But there is one last thing before I go into how to improve her, i want to mention, I love how she’s a sexual abuse victim yet is the character used for fan service. Love to see it. That isn’t weird at all. But on to how to improve her, again, make her relationship with Nekumaru more believable and genuine. And also maybe just have Nekumaru injured while trying to protect Akane. And have her immediately realize her fault and rush to Nekumaru to apologize and quickly call for Mikan. Nekumaru loses his entire hand. Nekumaru is sent to the hospita. Akane goes into his room and Mikan is talking to Nekumaru. Nekumaru notices Akne and asks Mikan to leave because they are about to discuss private matters. And it is there that he talks to Akane about her recklessness. Akane apologies multiple times and then asks why he protected her knowing the possibility of death. And why he almost threw it all away. It is then that Nekumaru tells Akane his backstory. He does want to live but either way he’ll be gone by 20. It wouldn’t make a difference, and he would be sad to see Akane die so young over something so stupid. He wants to help people and he doesn’t mind that as long as he has friends alongside him, even if he’s on his death bed. From there Akane promised to never do anything reckless ever again. She sweared in oath. She will then dedicate all her time to making Nekumaru feel happy knowing his short life and his new found disability caused by her. And lastly I want a really wholesome scene where Nekumaru has a bunch of goofy looking baseball hats on him, about 9 and he gives them to Fuyuhiko, Mikan, Akane, Hiyoko(who wanted to join to make Fuyuhiko realize that she doesn’t hate him) and Nekumaru, after the whole recovery party and they all play baseball in the morning with all of them on his team and Hajime also joining in to round out the numbers. And everyone else on the other. This means that the Akane dueling monokuma doesn’t happen until later until the game. They end up bringing a bunch of food as well for themselves. Nekumarus team ends up winning and he and his team walk off to go somewhere. Hajime staying behind to eat some food. The rest walk to the memorials they built and there he puts down a baseball cap on on both Peko’s and Mahiru’s memorials. He then gives a speech about how even if they’re dead they’ll still be on their team. Everybody joins in. Afterwards Hiyoko thanks them all then calls for Mikan, Mikan looking startled says “yes?!” Hiyoko: “I”\n",

From now on im the game Hiyoko calls Mikan by her name. Nekumaru keeps the last hat, saying that it’s for someone else in his life who isn’t here anymore, winking at Akane. Lastly, get rid of minimaru, just have Akne wear that baseball hat.\n",

His hand was cut off by Anakin, but we have seen in the past many times in Star Wars that it’s not really going to kill you immediately, especially a Jedi. Plus, he could have gotten a robotic hand afterwards. He also fell out of the window, which is what people I imagine assume killed him, but he could have very well survived that as well. If there is anything the Jedi are known for, it is they super human abilities, which include higher jumping and ability to control their fall so gravity doesn’t kill them as easily(see obi wan “hello there”). So it is very realistic that he survived the fall, went to get a robotic hand from one of the last few loyal doctors to the Jedi, and went into hiding during the years of the Empire. I also think a return of mace windu could have interesting story dynamics and arcs, as we would probably see an old man, regretting his mistakes and failures of the past, and trying to redeem himself.

            "The reason why people with high self esteem don't constantly seek validation is because they were already validated at their childhood. They generally have loving and supporting parents and even supportive friends at school. When loving parents are attentive to their child's emotional needs, shows their love, praises their hardwork (but not overpraise), and isn't too harsh on their mistakes, these will allow the child's self esteem to grow. They will grow up as people who are confident in their emotions and thoughts that they don't often seek validation.\n",

Why not just focus on the objective of the game as opposed to fighting with eachother over who can deal the most damage? Everyone wants to deal top damage, but there's not a lot of competition over who's taken the most damage or healed the most!

The same can be said for a healer. As a healer/support it's very rewarding knowing that you're sustaining the life of your teammates. Yea dealing high amounts of damage can satisfy the ego, but what good is dealing damage if the enemy support or healer can make it so you never did anything by healing their teammate back at full hp? Healers are the reason DPS and tanks can even survive the fight to win. DPS just spews damage hoping their tanks &amp; healers help keep them alive long enough.\n",

            "This opinion is based on most critics and the YouTuber PhantomStrider. The first Secret Life of Pets is kinda uninteresting at times and I find some scenes frustrating, like the one where Max and Duke get fucked over by stray cats and when Duke tries to reunite with his previous owner but it's still a pretty decent movie but nothing special. The sequel, oh man, what a sequel! I've heard people say that this movie lacks focus since it has 3 stories going on at the same time but eh, I don't feel like it's too unfocused and what helps is that 2 of the stories are more interesting than the first movie as a whole and they focus on pet lives (for the most part) anyway but that doesn't include the weird Gidget story, although that at least has a pretty funny scene with Chloe high on catnip. I think the fact that Snowball got an owner that he's happy with in the ending of the first movie and that she inspired him to become a super hero is really good. The 2D segment looks awesome but he roars for a surprisingly long time which is kinda weird. Snowball's story is the most interesting part of the movie, I love it. Max actually gets character development at the farm, how great is that? I mean I don't know much about character development but I assume that conquering his fears and becoming more brave as a result is character development, correct me if I'm wrong but I still like it anyway! I also really like how all 3 stories connect with the final climax as Max, Gidget and their friends join in to help Captain Snowball and Daisy with rescuing Hu... Again. The captain has a badass fight scene against Sergei's monkey and Sergei getting run over twice is SO satisfying considering how cruel he was towards Hu! I also like how the credits have a buncha internet dog videos, clever! And I just found out that Nick Kroll, the creator of and who is also a prominent voice actor in the Netflix show Big Mouth which I also like, voiced Larry! Yet another positive! In conclusion, I think The Secret Life of Pets 2 is a great and remarkable movie and it's definitely an example of an actually good animated movie sequel and it's my second favorite movie of 2019.

My problem with this is that he’s not actually making content, it has to be the most lazy excuse for content in years and is the same thing the youtube community shitted on Jinx back when Idubbz did his content cop. He isn’t making the video funny anymore with his own original content, like Heskey Time or any of his fifa videos.

Second fight with Logan he’s throwing haymakers and they draw. His second fight with Logan, which logan should’ve won had he not illegally punched him, he won. I’m not taking away from his dedication to learning but his fan base needs to stop acting as if he’s this god of boxing who knows everything and is the most skilled. This has slowly progressed to him thinking he’s actually good at boxing and can beat anyone in his path. Which is severely annoying to see because he has one of the biggest egos i’ve ever seen, he’s become such a twat in my opinion.

There was minimum action, pacing was slow, story was mid, and connecting to any character is so difficult.  Altogether I wish I’d have watched another movie because nothing happened the entire time. You learn of a small mystery and it unravels it painfully slow.  After the beginning it was like watching paint dry. Such potential and world building wasted on a story that could have been told in 30 minutes. The rest of the movie could have been the cool rebellion but nooo we don’t want to see the cool parts, that’s for “imagination”.  4/10 for me.\n",

People from ages 26+ are still conflicted on what they want to be, what they want to do, and the fact that they're getting older, puts pressure on them. They have these expectations that if you're this age, you have to have a house, live alone, have a well-paid job, have a car and all this other bullshit that a lot of them still don't have, and it's the feeling of shame that they didn't reach to the level that the Boomer could have achieved. Older generation wasn't expose to this much resources back then, and despite the fact that yes, they can use technology now and work on taking advantage of that to build themselves now, it's still the pressure of time and the feeling of 'I'm getting too old' or 'I'm running out of time.' Maybe thing's would have been different if they were expose to it ages ago.

I was throwing the frisbee for my dog at my normal dog park I visit more than 3x a week and talking with some lady walking her husky. She was completely baffled and I thought she couldn't be serious and told her \"well I don't lift my leg to pee so why and how could a dog brush its teeth\". She didn't like my response and then started threatening to call the police because I did not bring a leash to the park. All in all it seems like a pretty tedious task and theres no way my dog wouldn't resist me trying to force something into her mouth other than food or a toy. Without a human a dog couldn't brush their teeth and now I'm looking on the internet at doggo dental products and it's all so expensive. It all seems like a gimmick and completely pointless to do. My dog is very active and still catches frisbees at 9 years old. She's healthy and I take her to the vet twice a year. Not once have they mentioned  anything as far as dental hygiene goes. To be fair I take sticks that have fallen from the trees and throw those for her too and she's about shredded up the log she dragged home from the neighbors house. so she chews on alot of wood.

I saw three separate psychiatrists in the first two days I was there, they all confirmed my suspicions, PTSD. Leading up to a separate, more recent occasion, I had been researching again, and low and behold, my doctor is sending me for blood work and brain imaging. One of my issues is, I don't recognize what's normal bodily function and what's not, apparently it's not okay to have multiple falls at 20 years old, to not be able to hold your bladder for longer than a few minutes, for your heart rate to not fluctuate with exercise, but these are just a few of the things that I thought were normal, because I've been living with them for as long as I can remember. \n",

You have reduced the big picture down to tiny bits. Like as much as i enjoy listening to analysis and podcasts about movies, i don't want those videos to come into my head while i'm watching the movie.  Distracting me, breaking my illusion from it, telling me why the movie i am watching is so great or so bad; it would be better to just experience it. Most of the channels come from film students trying to make something of their own by analysing the craft of other classic movies that came before. That analysis about the shot selection, plot elements, twist, music que and score is great but after listening to many of those i have found myself focusing on those people's talking points in my head more rather than watching those play out in the movie. I would rather let myself come to the conclusion about the great stuff in those movie by myself.

Like with videos on film techniques, i feel like only those people who are interested in making movies or are already part of it should watch those more than anybody. Like Corridor Crew on YouTube, i enjoy hearing them talk about VFX in movies but after a while it just gets down to everything coming off from a computer.

            "\n",
            "1. **it’s your responsibility to check what you believe:** the reason people have to provide sources in scientific work isn’t to convince others but to make it easier to see how somebody came to a certain conclusion and to be able to talk about new concepts and informations instantly. It’s not that random stranger have to work to make you believe what’s right. You have to figure it out by yourself - people pointing out spots you’re wrong is a friendly service, no duty.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **A good source isn’t automatically a right source and other way around:** sources are just an indicator, no guarantee. Good sources can lie and bad sources can say the truth. There was a time where church was the good source per default and guys like Darwin, Galileo, Newton where the bad sources. In fact every concept that contradicts the previous one is seem as a bad source at the beginning. It’s up to you to see what is right.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Not every source has to be linked. „According to Sigmund Freud“, „The Study XYZ by Name from the university ABC“ or „in the book Name by Author on page X it says“ are valid naming of sources:** Naming a source has to give you the opportunity to check it. It mustn’t be easy to check, or free, or in the internet. A source is the Place the spokesman got their informations. It’s not a magic place the spokesman has to find for you so you could consume the background of an statement easily.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Telling someone you won’t believe anybody because they don’t deliver a source you like might let you win the argument, but don’t provide any benefits in most cases:** In most cases (all those that aren’t about if a certain thin happened or not - and even those often are excluded from the exception) this is just a trolling strategy to end the discussion. It’s no prove of concept at all. You’re not right just because someone doesn’t provide a source. Also to end an argument doesn’t give you right and ending an argument is not winning an argument.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **This post shouldn’t be an unpopular opinion because it’s scientific consensus:** everything I’m posting in this post are rules of scientific work - it’s called critical thinking. People wo don‘t believe in it and still argument with sources don’t understand what they are arguing about. You should not demand a source ever again as long you don’t understand these concepts. To demand a source is a preparation for critical thinking, not critical thinking itself. It doesn’t matter if a source was delivered or not - You still have to think critical in both cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **last but not least - to be critical and questioning something isn’t just asking questions about status quo:** critical thinking is checking every recourses and sources and making conclusions. You not just ask questions, you also answer those questions. The questions where made to check the believes, not to make a statement. They aren’t there for others delivering you something you can believe, they are made for giving you the resources to make your own conclusions (ohh and making an conclusions isn’t about to decide what side you prefer, but about figuring out what’s right besides of all sympathy). Edit: and critical isn’t against in general. You can be pro something and still critical with it. Critical is a method - not a position.\n",

When the game came out,  there was a set date for when the second season would come out and more content would drop, and people were enjoying the game when it first came out, 343 did listen to the feedback from halo 5 and they made a good game. It does have some issues like the xp system could use a bit of reworking and the customization system could as well. however these people do not understand is that reworking entire systems for a game takes a lot of time to test and develop. New content also takes time to be developed and its not like the second season has come out yet and we haven't gotten anything new. Hell we are getting teasers and info drops about the second season , and yesterday it was said that we are getting more info about season 2 very soon, and nothing ever satisfies these people. Forge is coming and from the leaks it looks like the it is the most capable and complicated forge to date which is amazing. another point is how people want every thing in the multiplayer to be free which is not feasible for a free to play multiplayer, some people have good ideas for a earnable currency through gameplay along with real life money. I find that people on the halo subreddit complain way too much and do not have any sort of patience, they expect new stuff right this instant. They also tend to get mad at either false things or misquoted articles, like for the halo tv show, a misquoted article said that they didn't look at the game when making the show, which people on the halo subreddit heard about and started being toxic towards people who made the show, and very recently people are getting angry about another misquoted article which allegedly says how 343 hates there fanbase, when in reality it says that they want to communicate with the fans to improve the game, while having halo reach a broader audience. Also for some reason these people do not like the idea of Halo Infinite reaching out to a broader audience, which is a good thing for me as more people would be halo fans, but these people want halo to only be for \"True Halo Fans\", which is stupid because we shouldn't gate keep on who can like or play halo infinite.

Mostly applies to service based businesses with a clientele rather than retail situations, but it could potentially apply anywhere; I've witnessed a restaurant patron denied service, reason being \"our other location warned us about you\". The saying \"The Customer is always right\"  has created generations of grown adults who are of the mindset that it's perfectly acceptable to make a complete ass of oneself when they don't get what they want. Social media exists, practically everyone has a camera with them, accounts are notated, sister locations talk, pretty much if you are being a \"Karen\", everyone is going to know. If you're finding yourself constantly asking \"Why can't I get good customer service,\" or \"Why won't anyone help me with xyz,\" it's likely your fault and you need to make yourself more appealing so businesses are more likely to accept you as a client over other more likeable clients.\n",
