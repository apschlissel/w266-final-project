I'm something like a badass, but not a big guy, and have always been prone to getting into fist fights (which later also became elbow, knee, feet, and submission fights). I don't start anything, but when someone does or says something blatantly disrespectful, I have a habit of pushing their buttons until they get mad enough to come at me. That way, I can \"defend\" myself. It's not fair, because I don't cut an imposing figure. I guess that's what they get for trying to bully somebody they think is weaker. Noone would ever be scared of me (unless I get mad, and the Hulk comes out). I just have this softspoken demeanor, that makes it hard to resist trying to punch me in the mouth when it goes to running. So, for times like that, I carry this mouthguard. As much as I like to fight, I do try to diffuse things in public, where I might get in trouble or something. I'm not good at deescalating those situations and backing down, so I do the next best thing: Talking trash while making a show out of putting the mouthguard in, and dancing around like I know something (Capoeira Ginga usually does the trick. Haha). Out of maybe 30-something encounters while carrying one of these, I've only had ONE get a little physical. Gave him a little love tap on the chin, and chambered a kick by his head to show that I could kick that high, and he didn't want any, after that. Nearly everyone backs down, when they see the mouth guard and think about it for a second. It's a powerful psychological weapon). Even a trained fighter (maybe even MORE-so than an untrained one?) would think twice about going at somebody who just put that in. Even myself. If I was in a confrontation and saw that, I'd assume he might have more training or skill than me, or at least have the ability to make me work. And I'd understand the unfair advantages he'd have from it.  \n",

Common grievances at the time included inflation of regional coins, corruption, and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their power-ups varied, the Toads called for the im-peach-ment of Princess Peach, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.

By May, a Toad-led hunger strike galvanized support around the kingdom for the demonstrators, and the protests spread to some 400 castles. Among the Peach's top leadership, Premier Toadette, Luigi and Captain Toad called for decisive action through violent suppression of the protesters, and ultimately managed to win over Leader Princess Peach and President Toadsworth to their side. On 20 May, the Kingdom Council declared boss battle mode. They mobilized as many as ~300,000 Toad troops to the Mushroom Kingdom. The troops advanced into central parts of Peach's Castle in the early morning hours of 4 June, killing both demonstrators and civil Goombas in the process. The military operations were under the overall command of Princess Peach, half-sister of President Toadsworth. Donkey Kong was later executed.\n",

            "Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n",
            "\n",
            "A few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n",
            "\n",
            "The day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n",

            "One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n",

I can bench press 1700 pounds. Now let’s look at the facts of Victorian life. Children were short, they were malnourished, and they were taught to be deferential, unlike today’s assertive children. A Victorian five year old would be about a foot tall, at most, and very skinny, making it as light as a mummified rat. I could easily pick up this Victorian child and dropkick it. With my superior strength and wind-speed calculating abilities, I would be able to kick it at a high enough velocity to achieve low earth orbit within seconds. If all the flesh wasn’t burned and ripped from its bones upon ascension and the high g-force didn’t give it fatal brain damage, it would instantly die from lack of oxygen.

All Brazilians were shocked and saddened to have missed the soccer World Cup in France. Should not. What is exposed below is the first-hand news that is being investigated by radios and newspapers from all over Brazil and some foreigners, more specifically the Wall Street Journal of Americas and the Gazzeta delo Sport and should be in the media soon, as soon as the evidence is collected and confirms the facts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Proven fact: Brazil SOLD the World Cup to FIFA. The Brazilian starting players were notified, at 1:00 pm on July 12 (final game day), in a meeting involving Mr. Ricardo Teixeira (the only time the president of the CBF attended a national team lecture), coach Mário Zagallo, Mr. Américo Faria, selection supervisor, and Mr. Ronald Rhovald, representative of sponsor Nike. Reserve players remained in isolation, in their rooms or in the hotel lobby. At first very upset, the players refused to exchange the fifth world championship for hosting the World Cup.\n",

            "Acceptance came through the payment of the total prizes, US$70,000.00 for each player, plus a bonus of US$400,000.00 for all players and committee members, for a total of US$23,000,000.00 twenty-three million dollars) through the Nike company. In addition, players who accept the contract with the Nike company in the next 4 years will have the same prize bases as the company's elite players, such as Ronaldo himself, Raul from Spain, Batistuta from Argentina and Roberto Carlos, too. of Brazil.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even so, Ronaldo refused to play, which forced the coach Zagallo to select the player Edmundo, saying that Ronaldo had problems with his left knee (in the first news released at 13:30 in the press center) and, soon after, at 14:15, changing the prognosis for stomach problems). His situation was only resolved after the Nike representative threatened to withdraw his lifetime sponsorship of the player, valued at over $90,000,000.00 (ninety million dollars) over the course of his career.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, it was agreed that Brazil would be defeated during the 'Golden Goal' (extra time with sudden death), but the apathy that befell the starting players made France, which absolutely did not participate in this negotiation, score, in two simple failures of the Brazilian team, the first goals. Mr. Sepp Blatter, new FIFA president, a French-Swiss citizen, applauded the collaboration of the Brazilian team, since the world championship brought balance to France at a time of the highest unemployment rates ever recorded in that country, which will be aggravated by the recent introduction of the euro (European single currency) and the European common market (ECC).\n",

            "You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n",
            "Chosen One Joy Boy Ex Machina to the rescue. The sheer convenience right now is insane. Handed Gear 5 on a silver platter to Luffy out of nowhere (Why didn't they activate before? Why now? Does this mean Luffy's life was never in danger? Were there never any stakes for his life? We'll see what explanations are given in the upcoming chapters.) and now he's going to body goddamn KAIDO with it. He was already \"Yonko level\" and going \"toe to toe\" with him without Gear 5 (which itself made no sense but fuck it), so his new Joy Boy powers should clap the fuck out of Kaido. There's no reason the Sun Boy Joy God powers wouldn't be substantially stronger than his already \"Yonko level\" self. \"Most ridiculous power in the world\", the chosen one's fruit that's been sought after by the government for years, the power that's \"only limited by one's imagination\", good lord he could probably handle Akainu and Blackbeard at this point.  \n",

Tension and stakes just dropped tremendously. Oda's going to have to pull a Kaguya Otsutsuki out of his ass to present Luffy with a challenge in the final battle.

Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Thailand has experienced multiple coups and military dictatorships.

In practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on power.[5] Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city.\n",

Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai's reign, gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty.\n",

            "Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid being colonised by foreign powers, although it was often forced to cede both territory and trade concessions in unequal treaties. The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of Chulalongkorn. In World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, which was an ally of Japan in World War II. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed SEATO, but since 1975, had sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbors. Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. Since the 2000s, it has been caught in a series of bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which culminated in two coups, in 2014, and the establishment of its current constitution, and ongoing pro-democracy protests.\n",

According to George Cœdès, the word Thai (ไทย) means 'free man' in the Thai language, \"differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs\".[16]: 197  According to Chit Phumisak, Thai (ไท) simply means 'people' or 'human being', his investigation shows that some rural areas used the word \"Thai\" instead of the usual Thai word khon (คน) for people.[17] According to Michel Ferlus, the ethnonyms Thai-Tai (or Thay-Tay) would have evolved from the etymon *k(ə)ri: 'human being'.[f][19]\n",

            "Thais often refer to their country using the polite form prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย), they also use the more colloquial term mueang Thai (Thai: เมืองไทย) or simply Thai; the word mueang, archaically referring to a city-state, is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region. Ratcha Anachak Thai (Thai: ราชอาณาจักรไทย) means 'kingdom of Thailand' or 'kingdom of Thai'. Etymologically, its components are: ratcha (Sanskrit: राजन्, rājan, 'king, royal, realm'); -ana- (Pali āṇā 'authority, command, power', itself from the Sanskrit आज्ञा, ājñā, of the same meaning) -chak (from Sanskrit चक्र cakra- 'wheel', a symbol of power and rule). The Thai National Anthem (Thai: เพลงชาติ), written by Luang Saranupraphan during the patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as prathet Thai (Thai: ประเทศไทย). The first line of the national anthem is: prathet thai ruam lueat nuea chat chuea thai (Thai: ประเทศไทยรวมเลือดเนื้อชาติเชื้อไทย), 'Thailand is the unity of Thai flesh and blood'.\n",

The word Śyâma is possibly not its origin, but a learned and artificial distortion.[clarification needed][20] Another theory is the name derives from the Chinese calling this region 'Xian'[g][21]: 8  A further possibility is that Mon-speaking peoples migrating south called themselves syem as do the autochthonous Mon-Khmer-speaking inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula.[citation needed]\n",

So many dicks.   When I went in the kitchen there's a five gallon jug of lube sitting  where the hand soap would be at the sink.  Dude even had a dick shaped  paper towel holder.

            "Dream hummed softly, amusement in his voice “what?” George picked up the poop with the napkin and grimaced- it was soft and smelled rancid; the scent stronger than he expected, he couldn’t help but curse as he answered dream “fuck- a cat took a shit on my windowsill” dream began to laugh loudly at his friends misfortune, George whined slightly as the poop slumped and broke in half must be really soft he thought as he picked up the rest of the poop using the napkin. Dream spoke again, surprising George “ well, are you going to eat it?” He teased- making George gag “DREAM! That’s disgusting- and no thank you that’s your forte” dream chuckled softly “well I’m going to head off for the night- text me if you wanna hop on among us, I haven’t played in awhile and I heard corpse is hosting a game pretty soon” Dream and George said their goodbyes, leaving George alone in his room with a handful of cat poop. Just as he walked to his trashcan to throw the poop away he noticed a tuft of fur sticking out of it- Jesus is that rat fur? Gross! He placed it on the counter in shock and felt his ears burn slightly if felt wrong but.... he was curious- maybe he could find a mouse bone or something and end his morbid curiosity off quickly before spending the whole night trying to sleep while thinking of cat poop.\n",
            "\n",
            "He picked up a plastic spoon and quickly poked at the poop- disgusted at how it broke easily; soft. A chunk of the poop stuck to the spoon so he smeared it down onto the napkin. It was creamy too... he noticed there were little bits of undigested meat and bone in the poop- and as he suspected a bit of fur as well. At this point the smell was pungent and awful- like rotten eggs and dead skin, all of it fermented in something that smelled a lot like.. well, shit. Just as he was about to throw the spoon away and call it a day- he felt a small pang in his chest. Curiosity? He felt his heart speed up as he smushed the poop down using the spoon- smearing it around the napkin like the worlds worst buttercream frosting. He was past the point of normal curiosity now- especially because he found he wanted to... keep going? It just- it looked so soft- it was slightly damp; almost resembling chocolate icecream melting- but too solid.\n",

This touch... so intimate...... why was his heart racing over this? He could.... what if he.. he moved the fingers towards his face, smelling it closer now. Worse now than before- the scent assaulted his nasal cavity- making him involuntarily jerk away and gag, it was so smelly and yet... he moved his thumb towards his lips and swallowed dryly as he stuck his poop covered thumb in his mouth it was just as bad- no worse that he expected he coughed and dry hurled- it tasted worse than it smelled, but the texture was almost like that of a fine silk mousse- the juxtaposition making him dizzy as he gripped the counter with his clean hand. His whole body felt hot- and now- fuck- no fucking way as he looked down he realized his sweatpants were tented, slightly wet at the tip. What if he.... just than his phone rang- and he blushed deeper . Dream!\n",

            "What would dream think if his best friend— he picked up the call regardless “uh- hello?” He said into the mic as he moved to clean his hand off. Dream spoke in amusement “hey dude! I just was taking a shit and-“ George blushed more “ DREAM! why- Why would you tell me that!! That’s so gross-“ dream cut him off “oh so you can talk about poop all you want but I can’t even- whatever; anyway! I had a idea for our next video-“ George held the napkin awkwardly- should he just throw it away? After all he did- and he was still... embarrassingly hard; and hearing dreams voice... he whined once again. Dreams voice suddenly became more serious “oh dude- is this a bad time? I can call again later- or just text-“ George interrupted him “no no- it’s fine it’s fine- just uh- I’m tired so... I don’t really wanna talk. But if you tell me your uh- idea I’ll listen” dream smiled softly “okay- so as I was saying-“ George listened for a few moments before zoning out again; focusing on the poop in his hand as he pulled his pants down slightly- he had a idea... what if......\n",

Do you think we can even program that?” George nodded before realizing dream couldn’t see him “oh yeah- course- probably- continue” as dream began talking again George bit his lip and pulled his cock out- lowering the dirtied napkin down to his leaking cock. He shyly wrapped the napkin around his cock and held in a moan . Fuck that felt good . It was warm and smooth- the perfect lotion for his masturbation session. The smell was still awful- and it wafted into his nose again; this time he could hold back his gag. Dream continued to talk as he slowly began to jack off with the cat shit- the little tufts of fur getting wet from his precum- little bits of undigested food sticking to his cock and getting stuck under his foreskin. He felt his balls tighten as dream lowered his voice slightly “ come on now George- you haven’t said a word! Do you really think you can do all of this? ” George laughed weakly “yeah yeah- I said I was tired! J-Just keep talking” he began to speed up his hand- it felt so good; the sensation addicting. Now the smell was beginning to get unbearable; and he audibly gagged. “Woah- George are you good?” Dream asked in concern. George groaned in annoyance so.... close...\n",

I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n",

            "A few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n",

He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n",

            "One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n",

            "Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.\n",

            "That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress.

            " Mina. I will first address your musicality and your performance, because this is how I started my journey with you. I want to talk about your voice, and state that it is like honey when I hear it. It is light and airy, and it flows beautifully over every Twice track. Your falsetto is gorgeous as well. It is stunning how strongly you are able to sing your lines and you do so with much consideration of how they compliment the rest of the song. There is so much classiness and elegance to your voice, and it is a very enchanting sound when you get to hear it. You always pour so much emotion and self-expression into your songs as well. All the same, you are an awe-inspiring dancer. Similarly to your vocals, you add a classiness and a magic to your moves that makes the rest of your members stand out alongside. You really increase to the unity by representing the appeal of Twice in your movements and cooperating flawlessly with your members. You always execute each move fully and completely, but I love the looseness of your movements as well that make you appear overall more delicate. You have truly changed the face of music and the way it appeals to people in this world because of your individuality. There could never be another who does what you do and you bring so much newness to the power of music. We are so grateful to you for presenting yourself as a monumental musician and for supplying us with so much of who you are. At the same time that I love your musical side, I also love your personality as well. You are sincerely one of the most warm and healing people that I know. It can be hard to discern how someone really is when you don’t actually know them, but with you, you are naturally just a good person. I realized I began to long for that feeling because you make me feel like I can be a better person just by being around you. On top of this, you are just so humble and extremely considerate of others’ feelings. I know that your members are the people in the world who have seen these qualities in a different light. I know that all nine of you have different personalities and will continue to change as you get older, but because you have such a deep love and bond with them, this could never change the relationship that you have built. Your presence is very healing, and it is comforts those who are around you. You listen to whatever they bring to you and you are there whenever you need them to be. You are always there, and is that makes you a perfect friend, and an even better family member. You give your members the nurturing and care they need, and because of this, you have become their family. You mean the world to them and I can just tell they can’t imagine living their lives without you. You have helped them become the people that they are today. Every day we get to watch them become more sure of themselves and more vibrant. I know that they can look at the darkest of days with optimism and hope because they have you to remind them that happiness is waiting for them again. There is no better person for your members to have spent all of their time with. They’ve been with you for some of the greatest and darkest moments, as you have been for them. They could not believe in themselves without you Mina, and just by being yourself, you are somebody who they can believe in as well. No matter what happens, they know that they have somebody who will continue to be there for them and support them for the rest of their lives. You’ve trusted them enough to see the real you, and in turn, they will show you unconditional love. Your members, also your family, can always be the best versions of themselves and can accomplish anything they want because you help them to recognize that in themselves. You will forever be the reason they can live life to the fullest. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you into the inspirational young woman that you are today. I know that your family means the world to you, and that you’ve relied on them during some of your toughest times. I know that you will continue to realize how much your family means to you, and that you are beyond appreciative of what they’ve provided for you. I just want to state that they will always love you and support you more than anybody else in this world. If you ever feel alone, I know that you will remember that your family will always come to pick you up and make you feel like yourself again. They are prouder than words can say of you and who you’ve become. You make them proud with every step you take every days and you could never do otherwise. No matter the choices you make, they will be there behind you. Once keeps them in their hearts as you do every single day, and we are thankful to them for making the world a better place as you are. Mina, I know that I can speak on behalf of all the Once when I say that you have shown us a way of life that we likely never imagined we’d see. With everything that you’ve been through, there has been no better motivation for us to believe in ourselves and achieve our own dreams. You treat us no different than your family, and you don’t even know all of us personally. It is you who supports us, and we are going to be striving to give you back everything you’ve given us for our entire lives. For some Once, when they really feel like they have nothing and nobody, they have you. If you ever doubt your impact on us, just know that there are people who can only say they see potential in themselves because you helped them to see it. You make us feel like we are worth trying what we want and to never give up. It is obviously not easy to always share how you’re feeling, especially in the position you’re in because of your profession, but even when you were dealing with emotions that could have been confusing to you, you showed that whole side of you to us.  I hope that this shows you that will never betray you or leave you. All we want is for you to express yourself the way you need to, for however long you need to, because we care about you as a person. I hope that we’ve helped to overcome what previously or might still cause you issues, because all we want is to be everything you need. There is nothing that I could say or do that could ever represent how thankful we are for the love you’ve shown us and the life you’ve shown us we can have. You change our lives everyday and we become better people because of it. I know you’ve been through a lot, both professionally and personally, and I want to be the one to just tell you directly how proud we are of you fo doing this. I don’t know if you can ever hear this enough, but you’ve shown strength that most people can only imagine of showing. You’ve grown from your restless struggles that have tried to hold you back, but you didn’t let them. You faced them head on and it takes courage beyond description to take time off to focus on you. Every person on this Earth can learn from how you’ve taken what once ailed you, and turned it into a reason to believe in yourself and others. You are one of the most inspirational people I know, and there will never be another whose journey has quite been like yours. You will always encourage others to confront what scares them, or what troubles them, and you show them it is okay to do it. We could not be more honored to be your fan and to say our role model is you, the bravest person we know. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true and that you can do all that you’ve wanted to accomplish! I hope that you take the time today, and every day to realize what you’ve been through, how you’ve grown, and what you teach the world. You deserve to be celebrated all the time because of how generous and thoughtful you are. I hope that this day is full of memories you won’t forget, and every second is spent exactly how you want to! I hope you are surrounded by those who can fill your heart will all the love in the world, and that this goes down to be one of the greatest days you can have! Your Once are celebrating how fine of a young woman you’ve become and continue to become every day! I also hope that all the blessings you deserve come to you on this special day! Thank you for sacrificing all that you have just to make Twice come to life. Thank you for suffering through all of the pain, emotions, fear, doubts, concerns, troubles, tears, and fatigue just to bring us any content at all. All of the efforts that you exert to make somebody happy in some way are acknowledged by us at every moment. Several Once are alive and okay because of you, and I hope you realize your worth in this world and to others. I hope you continue to put your health, happiness, and safety first, because that is all your Once ever want for you. We are so proud of you and can’t wait to see how you continue to grow in the future! Please don’t overwork yourself, because you are beautiful in our eyes and will always be! We will support you and love you forever as you do us, no matter what you choose in life. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in your future. Happy birthday Mina, and we adore you so much!**Show less**\n",

They were already 15 minutes late and the crowd was slowly spiralling out of the stadium. I checked my watch repeatedly, rolling my eyes at the fact that I had wasted 100 dollars for that ticket. They had just released Amnesiac, which was well received by critics, but I personally thought the album was mediocre. After 30 minutes, only about 100 people were left in the stadium and they all looked as if they were about to fall asleep. 45 minutes had now past and it was just about 80 people. That’s when the band finally came in. They looked drunk out of their minds and they didn’t even notice the ever shrinking audience. I rolled my eyes, ready for the worst performance of my life. But then they started playing Like Spinning Plates, and I instantly fell in love. The beautiful synths entered my ears and filled my whole body with the darkness engulfed within the sonic waves. The stars twinkled above as Thomas Yorkus’s voice engulfed the silent atmosphere of the nearly empty stadium. I nearly orgasmed after he hit the high note. The lyrics’s disturbing realities occupied my mind, filling me with anxiety and a hatred for the government. I quickly became an anti capitalistic anarchist, screaming along with Yorkus’s soaring vocals. The light sprinkles of the cymbals scattered throughout the ambience of the stadium, echoing off the hard concrete walls and into my ear holes and out my anus. As soon as the song ended, I quickly rushed to the stage and thanked Thom Yorkus for his beautiful sonic landscapes and messages encrypted within the song.\n",

She got all teary-eyed reminiscing on how close the deer got to the house and how cute and pretty and majestic and blah blah blah blah...

Standing in place to hide is on the same level of stupidity as that corny porno where that guy hides by sticking a lampshade on his head and pretending he's a lamp.\n",

How stupid do you have to be when *the creatures hunting your kind* are able to act more in your own interest than your own stupid self? Jesus Christ, the next time I see a deer, I'm getting out of my car and suckerpunching it with the biggest roundhouse I can muster. I want to do it so badly. I want to punch one and watch it look at me in shock with those empty, beady eyes. Then I'll punch it again. Fucking idiots. And if the buck comes around, I'll punch him too. Thinks he's so tough with his dumbass antlers. Idiots can't even keep them on for a full year. Bet I'll just knock 'em off, and I'd actually be doing the dumbfuck a favor since they'd just get caught on something out there otherwise.\n",

            "I would like to inform you that I busted a huge nut to your post. My earth shattering orgasm started making me moan loud enough to deafen anyone in the near vicinity. What followed was a torrential downpour of every single sperm cell I ever have or will ever produce, shot out so hard that it ripped my dick apart by my übernut accelerating to 7% the speed of light by the time it left my urethra. It punched right trough my wall, barely slowing down, before cutting trough a structural support beam in my building as it were a nuclear powered angle grinder. The shear weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path, caused my building to collapse, and every female in the city to fall pregnant with my children. When the death toll was tallied, there were 33 deaths, 148 injuries, and over 4 million pregnancies. As I lay dying under the rubble, I rest assured knowing every one of my sons will repeat this glorious act.\n",

I shake it off like there’s nothing to worry about, I turn 16 years old my mother noticed that my cave smells like fish, and she turn evil. She said “I have STDs, that I’ll be no longer going to the beach.” I loved the beach, the beach makes my vagina wet as a sponge. I begin to notice my vagina became scaly, and my legs begin to form scales. my legs weren’t working properly. My mother said I’m a ugly ass bitch that no men or women will love me cause I have a scaly vagina and legs. When I turned 18, I noticed that I have no legs but a tail, and my vagina behind my butt. I learned that I’m a mermaid, my mother saw my tail and she screams YOU UGLY ASS BITCH GO TO THE SEA ! I cried I ran away, by hopping to the beach, until I saw a hot ass guy having a 6 pack, brown eyes, and sexy black hair. He had a different body part than me, he had a tail too. Until I saw a older man, I learned that I’m the lost princess of AssLandta.I gracefully hopped into the ocean, and marry that hot ass guy, he had a big ass dick. Now I’m in the ocean, we all have phones. That’s how I became a mermaid princess\n",

Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids.

            "It's a fairly common question, mostly because when people see 6 and 7 next to each other, it doesn't really make sense. 6 is large, muscled, and trained in multiple martial arts, while 7 is fairly average, physically, and short. However, 6's fear of 7 has its roots in childhood. See, 6 and 7 grew up together, and for a few years, they were best friends. But then 6 kissed 3, and they became childhood sweethearts. 7 secretly had feelings for 3, so 7 decided he needed to destroy 6 to win 3's affection. He started subtly, undermining 6 whenever possible with passive aggressive comments and compli-sults. But over time, things got much more insidious. 7 started messing with 6's performance in school, bringing down his grades and turning teachers against him. Even worse, 7 became great friends with 6's parents and slowly turned them against their own offspring. At night, 7 would sneak into 6's bedroom, and whisper depressing and hopeless things into his ears. Every time 3 was around, 7 would pants 6 and make fun of his genitalia, or try to body shame him in other ways. However, 3 was both smart and compassionate, and saw through 7's schemes, sticking with 6, trying to counter 7's psychological tear-down with compliments and friendship. Finally, 7 decided that he would never be able to win 3, so he drugged both 6 and 3, taking them to an abandoned cobbler's hut on the edge of town. There, he proceeded to torture and maim 3, forcing 6 to watch in horror, unable to do anything to save his sweetheart. 7 didn't kill 3, but instead, put her in a semi-vegetative state. 7 cleaned the scene of his prescence, then called the cops, having 6 blamed for 3's condition. 6 was sent to prison, believing 6 was guilty, 6's parents fell into a deep depression, eventually committing suicide over what they believed 6 had done. After serving 17 years of a 30 year sentence, and getting out on good behaviour, 6, now muscled and skilled as a fighter, thought he might get revenge on 7. But when he finally tracked down 7, he found out that 7 had installed a micro-bomb into 3's body, and should he be killed, the bomb would automatically go off and kill 3 as well. And though she was still in a mostly fugue state, 6 couldn't bring himself to hurt her any further, and decided to try and move on with his life. However, being an ex-con, it was difficult for him to get a job. 6 finally found employment at a diner, which 7 then bought, and proceeded to again undermine and toy with 6 at every turn. 6 tried to find employment elsewhere, but 7 contacted any potential employer and soured them against 6. 6 finally realized that no matter what he did, 7 was going to try and ruin his life, and he resigned himself to living as a broken, lonely man, never able to stand up to the depraved, amoral 7.\n",

            "      * For [Bats](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Bats), [Skeleton Dragons](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Dragons), and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n",
            "      * For [Minions](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Minions), [Skeleton Barrel](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Barrel), [Mega Minion](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Minion), [Flying Machine](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_Machine), [Electro Dragon](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Electro_Dragon), [Baby Dragon](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Dragon), [Inferno Dragon](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Inferno_Dragon), [Balloon](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Balloon), and [Lava Hound](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Lava_Hound), stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n",
            "   * They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result.  Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot  will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes  him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n",
            "* The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due  to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed  on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He  can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will  pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them  when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back.  This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane  they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a  large push.\n",
            "* A [Tornado](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Tornado)  placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and  staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without  any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future  pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a  Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the  King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening  up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative  is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range  of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none  of them are already distracted\n",
            "* A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the [Musketeer](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Musketeer), and the [Valkyrie](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Valkyrie),  typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend  against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog  Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal  damage to the tower. \n",
            "   * This can be effectively countered by [Lightning](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning),  one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and  Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap  them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is  defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely  damage the Tower.\n",
            "   * The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n",
            "* A Hog Rider combined with a [Goblin Barrel](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Barrel) can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the [Goblins](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Goblins)  is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel  can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir  trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.\n",
            "* Pairing the Hog Rider with the [Balloon](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Balloon)  can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will  act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The  Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the  combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air  cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings.  Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move  speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in  different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a  building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.\n",
            "* The Hog Rider can be paired with the [Lumberjack](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Lumberjack)  as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an  extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to  counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like [Arrows](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Arrows) to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped [Rage](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Rage) will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.\n",
            "* A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and [Mini P.E.K.K.A.](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Mini_P.E.K.K.A.)  combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more  damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can  deal with troops like the [Executioner](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Executioner) and [Musketeer](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Musketeer).  However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army,  which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area  damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the [Minion Horde](https://clashroyale.fandom.com/wiki/Minion_Horde) can stop this easily.\n",
            "* A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the  match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider  will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This  can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they  happen to react to him fast enough.\n",

Sarcasm can be a self-defence mechanism. But in one moment the cap of patience will overfill and all hurt inside you will pull out.

Now hypothetically speaking, this could be satire and bringing attention to dating violence. On the other note, people say it’s a part of the Incel movement. For example, one video to me is sort of funny where he says he’s going to feed his date to the sharks. I can see humor in that. But another was like I’m going to take you off life support and another was like I’m going to drop a dumbbell on your head. NGL, those made me uncomfortable.

That 2018 and 2019 were the last good years before covid times and 2013 had the best mobile apps to play. 2014 and 2015 seem to be left to the wayside despite them being peak 10's along with 2016 and had elements of the early 10's left behind but also the first few specks of the culture that would dominate the late 10's. I think this is because we have not yet reached the 10 year mark of those years unlike 2010-2012 currently and many may think 7-8 years ago are too recent to feel nostalgia for. As well as the late 2010's still being fresh in everyone's minds and the last few years of greatness (relative to present day) before the 2020's began.\n",

I'm kinda hooked on some substances too and I think enlisting will give me structure and purpose which will hopefully help me get sober for once, it'd also give me a job where I don't gotta deal with regular problems like finances and housing. I honestly don't care if I die cause at least I would have been selfless for once in my life so the whole \"you could get hurt or killed\" thing doesn't sway me. I also don't care about the pay or possible psychological damage all I really want out of enlisting is either a roof over my head and free food or the capability to sacrifice something for others since I grew up with not a lot and ik what it's like to not have the kind of \"perfect American\" life most people have yk. So if I enlist at least I can help someone and I don't see myself ever doing something as selfless if I get a degree and a good-paying job and attempt to live a \"cookie-cutter\" life.\n",

Don't let them fool you, there are many good artists as well. Like, Tate McRae, Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Jack Harlow, many indie artists as well.

The mid-2010s were an amazing time to be alive, things hadn't gotten political yet (in 2013-2015, that is) and the internet pop culture felt very similar to it in the early 2010s. The only real difference I could think of between the early and mid-2010s was that the mid-2010s had more advanced technology than the then early half, but I don't see how that's a bad thing. In the early 2010s people were already glued to screens and would walk around with their phones out, nothing really changed in the mid-2010s technology-wise. Yes, new consoles did release in the mid-2010s but not everyone got them as soon as they came out, most people still used Xbox 360/PS3 when the mid-2010s started. The mid 2010s were barely any different from the early 2010s excluding 2016, I don't get why people hate on them so much!\n",

Compared to a 1997-2012 Z range where the first half is likely to solidly remember parts of the 2000s so we're able to make judgement from our own experiences. But most people born past 2014/2015 wouldn't be able to tell you what the 2010s are like.

I remember playing sports with my friends at recess and feeling great about myself when I won, and I was sort of known as being the best kicker in my school. This is also the year that I got unlimited access to the internet, so I really stetting familiar with the current trends and even started posting videos to my YouTube channel. 9/10\n",
            "3. 2013 - This year felt very similar to 2012, although I did start getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in back in 2012 so it wasn't as fun. That aside, I still think 2013 is an amazing year and I would love to go back and experience it again! 8.999/10\n",
            "4. 2016 - This year was decent in my opinion, though the summer carries making it a very memorable year for me. My friends and I would hop on Skype every day during that summer and just talk with each other, one time we stayed up late laughing our asses off at memes on Youtube. That night will probably go down as one of the best nights of my life, even if I was only 10! I was also decently edgy during 2016, I watched a lot of LeafyIsHere/Idubbz/Keemstar during this year and would talk about the Youtube drama with my friends at school. 2016 is one of the most memorable years of my life and I personally enjoyed it, 8.5/10.\n",
            "5. 2017 - Nothing too special happened in this year, though nothing really bad happened either. This year was pretty fun for me, especially the later part of it. I started playing Fortnite around September of 2017, which is why I am ranking this year so high. The old Fortnite carried the second part of 2017, it was the first time since 2012 that I felt a burning passion for a video game and I genuinely felt like I was a 6-year-old again when playing it. That being said, 2017 was a pretty shitty year for me as well. I got bullied a lot in school during this year and my best friend moved away which sucked. This was also the first year that I felt like I was completely DONE with my childhood, in 2016 I still felt a little bit like a kid but by 2017 I felt like an adolescent. 2017 is a weird year for me, but I'd say it is pretty underrated. 7.5/10\n",
            "6. 2019 - I did sort of like 2019. Lots of people shit on this year due to how modern it is, but I have to disagree with them. 2019 was an ok year for me, although the winter of 2019 carried this year for sure. I don't have too much to say about this year, it was fun but overall felt too modern for my likening. 7/10\n",
            "7. 2015 - I am NOT ranking 2015 high because I think the year itself was bad. This year was great, it was the last year before politics were a massive part of everyday life (even for people who weren't into them), and 2015 was the last year with early 2010s culture influence. Even though 2015 was a good year in itself, for me it definitely wasn't. I got bullied a lot during this year and last a lot of my friends, I also remember having a ton of headaches in 2015 because of how much I grinded my teeth back then. I also started getting burnt out on stuff I was interested in before, I have a very specific memory of me playing Minecraft in 2015 and genuinely feeling depressed because it didn't have the same charm to it as it did 3 years prior. This wasn't just with Minecraft as well, lots of other things I was interested in back in 2012-2014 randomly became boring in 2015 for no reason at all. While 2015 was a great year in itself, for me it was not the best. 6.5/10\n",
            "8. 2018 - This year was probably one of my worst. This is when puberty was starting to affect me, and I lost practically all my friends due to switching schools midway through the year. I got bullied a lot during 2018, probably my worst year for bullying so far. A bunch of kids from my school found my old Youtube channel from when I was 8 and would constantly bully me for it, leading to me deleting the channel (I regret doing that to this day). In conclusion, I became extremely depressed during this year and I did not like the pop culture of it at all. 5/10\n",
            "9. 2021 - This year was very weird for me, it had its moments but I did not like this one at all. Even the lockdowns were lifted this year, it didn't feel the same as pre-covid life. I still had to wear a mask and lots of events I enjoyed doing before covid were canceled due to the Delta variant. I also was very addicted to social media throughout this year, especially Twitter which is one of the worst platforms I've ever seen. I could go on and on, but in conclusion, 2021 was 2020 without the lockdown. 2/10\n",

            "The  Bureau of Labor Statistics' January jobs report was recenlty released  stating that the economy added 467,000 jobs last month. This is a  surprise considering many observers and the White House itself thought  that it would show a decline in employment of about that same level.  Their belief has to do with the way virus related business closures and  work disruptions are counted in the report. For good reason workers  unable to work because of covid infections and at home are considered to  be layed off, and we all know about the high level of person to person  transmission that struck the nation over the past month and can see the  number of business and other facility closures it has caused. So why  then was the figure we got today so rosey and how does it compare with  other less well known but perhaps more reliable government statistics  that try and tell us something about the labor market.\n",
            "\n",
            "Among  a host of other challenges involved in understanding the household and  establishment surveys that make up the BLS report which I have discussed  elsewhere there is the fact that all data in these surveys are  SEASONALLY ADJUSTED. This sounds like a means to take seasonal factors  such as weather into account when calculating how many jobs were created  or destroyed, but they're really a practice by which long-run averaging  is used to disguise volatility in the figures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The  downside to this is that it can misrepresent the actual situation. Say  the economy's been in a slump for a prolonged period and the average of  jobs lost each month is -300,000. Then a number above -300,000 for a  given month even if still negative at say -100,000, could still be  counted as positive. The same goes for positive numbers; with an average  of +300,000 jobs a month a number below that, say +200,000, could be  ADJUSTED to show a less positive or even negative number. This is to  some extent an oversimplification of the process but gets across the  manner in which such figures are constructed. And the same sort of  method is also applied to the unemployment rate and all other economic  date from the government. So we can see how unreliable much of this is.\n",
            "\n",
            "In  fact in this past July's jobs report this is stated outright when the  bureau writes “\\[s\\]taffing fluctuations in education due to the pandemic  have distorted the normal seasonal buildup and layoff patterns, likely  contributing to the job gains in July. Without the typical seasonal  employment increases earlier, there were fewer layoffs at the end of the  school year, resulting in job gains after seasonal adjustment. These  variations make it more challenging to discern the current  employment  trends in these education industries.” (The Employment Situation July  2021 p. 3)  [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit\\_08062021.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_08062021.pdf)\n",

            "So  think of it, some months when jobs are actually gained we see a loss  and in some months when there are really losses we're told there are  gains. **A better if still  imperfect measure of the jobs situation can be found in another measure  in the BLS report called the Employment-Population Ratio.** This  number, if still seasonally adjusted, tries to compare the actual number  of people with a job to the entire working age population of the United  States. Unfortunately it fails to take into account the number of stay  at home mothers, who actually are not in the labor force, but in our  modern world this is such a rarity that statistically it shouldn't  impact the overall data too much.\n",

            "**In this month's report the EMPLOYMENT-POPULATION RATIO IS A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED 59.7.**  That means 40.3% of people 22 and older, according to this measure, are  without a job. If we subtract the about 12% of the population who are  actually retired we get a a jobless rate of at 27.7%. (The Employment  Situation January 2022 p. 8 Summary Table A.)

            "Still  there is a seperate set of government employment figures this time  released by the Census Bureau, which tell a somewhat different story.  Since the beginning of the pandemic they have been tasked with compiling  a newer Household Pulse Survey designed to give us a more real-time  assesment of the US labor market and other information. These measures  are taken every two weeks or so and not only work to give us a better  picture of the employment situation, but also wider social trends  regarding food security and education since the onset of covid-19. For  the week ending January 10th this study puts the number of unemployed  Americans at 107,302,764 out of an adult population of 250,265,449. That  would give us a figure of about 42%.

            "This  is important because prior to Week 34 (July 21-August 2 2021) of the  series only about one to two million Americans would be represented in  this last category, with the figure shooting up to between 8,000,000 and  11,000,000 in the subsequent periods. This may very well represent a  fall in motivation to fill out the survey among a cohort of workers who  previously gained new employment after the initial nationwide  quarentines and massive job losses but have since re-entered the ranks  of the unemployed.

Even media that doesn’t use jump scares, can have tension that feels like it’s leading to something unpleasant, and the consumer could very well be assuming there is something bad for them coming up.

It's a medical procedure, a surgery - how is it anyone else's business?  And yet people who undergo it seem to seek out opportunities to disclose that they've had it done.  If it is covered by insurance no doubt part of it is not, and men have to pay out-of-pocket to have it done.

            "Quite simply there are two main flavors of pop punk, yet they get lumped together in the same genre. Nobody seems to be bothered by this, but I believe it is very much noticable. The two types have very distinct differences in sound. In group one, you have the more modern, emo infused pop punk with nasally vocals and lyrics that are more focused on love and relationships etc. I'm talking bands like Neck Deep, The Story So Far, The Wonder Years etc. In the other camp you have bands that follow more closely to the skate punk era of the 90's. The instumentals are generally heavier as well as the content of the lyrics. These are bands like PUP, Jeff Rosenstock, Alkaline Trio, and older albums from the Menzingers. I'm not hating on any of these bands. I love music from the whole spectrum of the genre, but you can't tell me that they're the same thing. Even bands like NoFX, Bad Religion, and Lagwagon often get lumped into the pop punk category. There seems to be no consistency. At the end of the day some bands have a vastly different ratio of pop to punk.\n",

It really bothers me when someone (like Anthony Fanta o) can’t give an album a good name based off the fact it isn’t technical and impressive story wise, I think it’s stupid when someone can’t appreciate something for the fact they are just having fun in the studio, i so believe most people who thing that don’t make the music just observe. deep down we should never take things too serious imo, so I love albums with little meaning and a lot of vibes, lmk if you agree or disagree.\n",

            "I always had a very full beard from the time i could grow one (17yo) and hated shaving. I have had everything from a short, well groomed beard, to a long biker style beard. I might hav shaved once a year up until 2020. I am 30 now and it wasn’t until i got a job that required clean shaving (for safety reasons) that i actually began to not only tolerate shaving but prefer it to having facial hair. If done daily, its hardly the inconvenience its made out to be. It takes me maybe a minute to shave my face, and with the use of shaving soap and a safety razor, is a negligible cost. I used to think it caused skin irritation, which it does, but your skin adapts to it and the break out goes away after a few weeks of consistency. In fact, i find that my skin is actually more clear than when i had a beard. I had terrible acne under my beard (a huge motivation for having it) and it has cleared up since i started shaving nearly everyday. Beards get too oily, or too dry, and have to be trimmed and maintained daily. I have found shaving actually SAVES both time and money. I also feel cleaner and neater and am more comfortable when sleeping, eating and participating in physical activity. I also find the actual process very zin and orienting. Even if i end up in a different line of work, i don’t know if I will ever go back to the beard.\n",
            "Cars today have reached a level of safety people 50 years ago would have thought impossible. These improvements give people a false sense of security leading to more reckless driving causing more accidents. When I was a kid the speed limit on the interstate was 55 in the city and 65 once outside city limits. Today it is 70 no matter if inside city limits or not. We seem to keep amping up the danger the more we make things safer. If you want to make the roads safer for you and your family then we need to make them more dangerous so people use caution while driving. Replacing airbags with sticks of dynamite would drastically reduce the number of accidents and therefore deaths every year. Imagine if you blew up instead of face smashing into the most bricklike pillow you've ever had the displeasure of passing out on, you'd drive a hell of a lot safer wouldn't you? Of course there'd be a learning curve that first year, but by the end of the second year the numbers would drastically reduce if there were anyone left.\n",

They're a holdover from a bygone era; when computer mice worked by tracking the position of a rubber ball, trapped with just enough hanging out to engage the surface it was rolling over.  A common problem when the mouse, when used on a smooth polished surface (like a desk), is that the ball would lose traction and the pointer would freeze up or jump around on the screen.  To remedy this issue, you would use a mouse pad, designed to stick to the desk on one side, and create friction with the tracking ball inside the mouse on the other.  With modern light and laser based computer mice being cheap, reliable, and readily available, the mouse pad is just an unnecessary encumbrance to the distance with which you can move your mouse without having to pick it up and reposition it on the pad.

Find out within the first few semesters that college isn't for you? You'll be able to quit with minimal student debt.

So you're looking for a fling, and you meet Stacey or George, as the case may be, and after a couple of dates, they ask you to be exclusive, the next day you catch Stacey with George or George with Stacey.

We're so good at compressing data these days that you can fit near-lossless quality into just 128mbps. And even if you can make out the most subtle of differences, is it *really* worth it?

Most stuff is perfect about 10 - 15 minutes after it’s plated.\n",

            "Its evil because I feel some awareness and prevention things are doing this more for the money. They center only off a few kids being bullied instead of the subject as a whole. I was bullied almost my whole childhood. And these mean nothing. The schools rules about bullying suck too. And even if you “tell a trusted adult” teachers and counselors could care less. And most likely believe the bully more. And if they hit you, you better not defend yourself and hit back bc that gives you detention… it makes no sense and its lazy. They only care for your grades.\n",

            " I really don't get this bullshit of people owing you or not owing you anything. It really just seems like an excuse to use to treat people like shit, especially when it comes to ghosting. Basically what they're saying is that they're not legally obligated to anything with anyone... yeah, so ? That still doesn't make you any less of an asshole if you don't at least show a little bit of respect to others. Most of the things that you do in life out of basic respect are not done because the other person is entitled to them, you do them because you know that's the right thing to do. If someone was mad that you didn't give them a second chance, that you didn't do a favor for them, mad that you didn't give them money, or basically any situation that actually makes you do an extra effort or sacrifice then I could understand using that phrase, but most of the time it's just used to excuse lack of basic decency. I just find it so ridiculous that the justification is \"I don't actually have an obligation to anything with you therefore I'm not the asshole\", it doesn't matter if you don't have an obligation, that still doesn't make you any less of a jerk, so not only does it seem like a stupid excuse, in a way I also feel like by saying that phrase you're not really saying anything.\n",

I didn't get the joke, but everyone else did. \\n\\nThe hats (you can google image search them) were given out in jubilation back in 1999 when the DOW crossed 10,000 for the first time. But then things got bumpy.\\n\\nTen thousand wasn't the top, there was still another 10% rise, but then, in 2002, the DOW crossed 10,000 again -- this time in the wrong direction -- and bottomed at 8,000. Two years later, it crossed 10,000 again (yay!) and even rose another 40% (double yay!). But then, in 2008, it crossed back down (boo!) and bottomed just above 6,000. \\n\\nSo when my boss came in with his rakish grin, wearing his original DOW 10,000 hat, it was a humorous nod to all of those ups and downs, and that now, a full...   \n",

I previously shorted LCID late last year and early this year for some mediocre, paper-handed gains and thinking about doing it again. I look at RIVN and LCID and both seem to have fairly reasonable downfalls aka: don't make many cars/SUVs, don't currently make money, and have gassed up valuations. My discussion question here is, can anyone explain to me the case for an outdoor adventure vehicle that is solely battery-powered? If I am on an adventure through the Grand Canyon or Sierras wouldn't I want the gas backup? Is the idea that battery charging will be ubiquitous in \"the future\"?   \n",

I previously shorted LCID late last year and early this year for some mediocre, paper-handed gains and thinking about doing it again. I look at RIVN and LCID and both seem to have fairly reasonable downfalls aka: don't make many cars/SUVs, don't currently make money, and have gassed up valuations. My discussion question here is, can anyone explain to me the case for an outdoor adventure vehicle that is solely battery-powered? If I am on an adventure through the A thousand dollars Canyon or Sierras wouldn't I want the gas backup? Is the idea that battery charging will be ubiquitous in \"the future\"?  \n",
