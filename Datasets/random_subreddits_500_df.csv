4,Bitcoin,"So disclaimer.  Most of my understanding of bitcoin comes from this article.

https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/

Now, I've been reading more about bitcoin trying to understand it better and I'm kind of stumbling over the concept of nodes and block size.

If I understand what I'm reading correctly, nodes are simply users.  In other words, Alice and Charlie in the article I posted above have a full node. 

Nodes are significant in that they can broadcast transactions and contain a full history of the blockchain, and can thus audit the blockchain independently.  Nodes broadcast transactions on the internet, and miners can use their proof of work to confirm that the transactions are valid.  

Nodes, however, can chose which miner can validate transactions.  If enough nodes and miners separate from the bitcoin consensus, that creates a fork.

So..... some questions.

1) Is this explanation right?

2a) Let's say I download Exodus wallet.  Do I have a full node?  If I don't, what do I have?  

2b) If I don't have a full node, then I suspect that there a company that runs Exodus wallet that runs a full node, and thus, broadcasts my transactions for me.  Is that the case?

3) How would an increase in blocksize from 1MB to, say, 8MB effect my ability to audit a blockchain or run a node?  A block is just a list of transactions right?  So why doesn't 8 1mb node = 1 8mb block?  (As you see, I don't know shit about shit).  

Thank you very much for your help.",0

11,Bitcoin,"**Head of Euro Pacific Capital called foolish people's attempts to save their savings by investing in Bitcoin.**

Cryptocurrencies cannot be used to hedge against inflation, says Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital. Debating with Australian economist Steve Keen, Schiff compared digital assets to fiat currencies.

The crypto skeptic stated, *""Fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies have no real value. They have the same weakness - people's trust backs them. That's why it's foolish to try to save your savings during a crisis by investing in Bitcoin.""*

He didn't exclude that one day the Bitcoin value will overcome the historic high of $69,000, which was set in November last year. However, according to Schiff, cryptocurrency is just a financial bubble.

*""I don't know how big this bubble is going to get before it bursts. But I'm smart enough to see the bubble when it inflates,""* Schiff pointed out.

Last September, the economist predicted the collapse of altcoins once the cryptocurrency bubble burst. Also in 2020, he claimed that bitcoin will never be able to exceed the $20,000 mark and called the cryptocurrency a ""*sinking ship.""*

Peter Schiff is one of the most famous critics of the first cryptocurrency. In 2011, when BTC was worth about $1, he said he would have preferred to invest $10,000 in gold instead of bitcoin since it was unknown what would happen to it in a few years. Since then, the first cryptocurrency has risen by 4.4 million percent. ",0

They have created a new consensus protocol called Proof-of-Proof which basically uses the OP\_RETURN portion of BTC transactions to include data about the security inhering chain in BTC blocks and in that way the chain inherits BTCs security. At one point it was responsible for 30% of all BTC transactions but since then, up until very recently, they have had some development hurdles and it now is responsible for more like 1-4% of all BTC transactions. So atm 1-4% is pretty irrelevant but if it does manage to achieve wider adoption, they only have 1 small coin integrating PoP on testnet atm and one in mainnet which they created themselves, it will result in an increase of BTC tx prices which might be undesirable. Yes, they are paying for the transaction so there shouldn't be a problem but at some point I think it might become harmful for BTCs utility if tx fees are too high. What are your opinions on it? Is it spam and bad for BTC or as long as their paying its np, like for miners for example it should be a good thing with the higher fees and all and with the fact that BTCs block reward will be 0 eventually?",0

So break up the  absolutely unfair politic from the banks of their countries. When more  market costumers this doing, than break up the holy system.

43,Bitcoin,"In a nutshell W. Buffet is considered one of the worlds best investor and built his entire fortune on investing - he has been on forbes top 10 richest since like th 90's. He is also known as the Oracle of Omaha and has over the years been known to give very thoughtful and time tested advice in investing. Here is my attempt to try and list some of his teachings in a cryptocurrency context. For those who don't know who Warren Buffet is I advice you to go to his wiki page.

Apologies if I mess something up. Below of the interesting nugget of investment advice from the Buffet. I change a few words around to try to relate more to cryptocurrency but I think some of his thinking is still relevant.

1. Keep all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket closely. T*hat is don't over diversify sometimes its better to just concentrate on a few projects and watch it very close*.
2. In a volatile market, patience is key. Hold steady and wait.
3. Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. *This is self explanatory, as they say here on crypto, bear markets are where fortunes are made*.
4. Investing is laying out money now to get more money back in the future.
5. Never invest in a project you cannot understand or use; know what you are getting into.
6. I don't look to jump over 7-foot bars: I look around for 1-foot bars that I can step over ( *I interpret this as don't try to make that 1000x instead go for consistent and proven coins that can be easily understood* )
7. If a project does well, the asset will eventually follows.
8. For some reason people take their cues from price action rather than from values. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.
9. In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine. ( *this is why on the short run a token can get pump from sheer marketing/popularity but eventually the value of its utility will come into play, I know I know, shibu and what not; for the most part I think this still holds true* )
10. The most common cause of low prices is pessimism. We want to purchase in such an environment, not because we like pessimism, but because we like the prices it produces. It's optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer. *None of this means, however, that a token is an intelligent purchase simply because it is unpopular; a contrarian approach is just as foolish as a follow-the-crowd strategy*.
11. Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.
12. It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.
13. All there is to investing is picking good projects at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good projects.
14. Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing. ( *this is actually very true in crypto, don't over extend on too many projects, instead pick a few and study it hard* )
15. You do things when the opportunities come along. I've had periods in my life when I've had a bundle of ideas come along, and I've had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I'll do something. **If not, I won't do a damn thing**. ( *I bold the last part, sometimes doing nothing is best*)
16. What we learn from history is that people don’t learn from history.
17. You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.
18. You don't need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ. ( *being smart is not everything its diligence, patience, and following through, and all the above*)
19. You should invest in a project that run by as much decentralization as possible, because someday a fool will.
20. Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth. ( similar to pt 1 doesn't spread yourself too thin; instead pick a few projects and study it hard )

A pre-determined % (also voted on by shareholders - everyday people) of the bitcoin mined is sold monthly. As long as the profits from the sale exceed operating costs and the necessary amount for expansion, then the customers would not need to pay for their energy. **Free energy.** If that amount is not met on a particular month, then the cost of the energy would still be greatly offset.

I don't have an android anymore, so I can't open the file on the original app, or on the original phone. Unsure what to do. Im including photos of the file type and the app that I downloaded in 2016. 

Cheers mates! Any and all help is appreciated!

91,Bitcoin,"Sitting on the toilet wondering if nefarious actors had access to vast resources, what would be the most efficient way to take down the bitcoin network. Basically a hypothetical war game scenario. 

The most probable scenario I landed on would be to collude with global Internet Service Providers to either simultaneously block all incoming individual mining traffic through their networks, or block the largest mining pool operators connection to the network. 

Then it would potentially be feasible to capture &gt;50% of the network mining resources and rewrite/destroy the code. This would require a ridiculous amount of mining hardware, or some kind of massive cloud operation. 

I could be way off since I don’t have the technical expertise that many of you possess. But if you had to guess how this feat could be hypothetically  accomplished, how would it happen?",0
92,Bitcoin,"Hi.

(English is not my native.)

We all know why are we all here. I own BTC as part of my portfolio, you own BTC as part of your portfolio.

But let's talk a little about [WEF](https://www.weforum.org/) which became internet famous in the recent months after Covid with its famous slogen: **""You will own nothing and be happy""** and with all the fuss about **""The Great Reset""**

Without stating whether one is agree, believes, or disagree, disbelief with such things, let's run an open thinking experiment.

1. Let's assume that in 10 years from now, recent Bitcoin investors will really reach financial freedom, a safe heaven from bank's greedy and untrustworthy rigged system.
2. Let's assume that big bank people who makes big money by milking services of capitalism like selling you loans with greedy terms and making fiat worthless by printing money won't be happy about this, and they would want to end the reign of cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

**What condition(s) stops the leaders of the world to simply cut us from Bitcoin?**

\- Fiat becomes a digital money. ([CBDC](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbdc-launch-first-2022-093011347.html)) Every spending of yours, including your income, any income would be monitored.

\- As [CBDC](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbdc-launch-first-2022-093011347.html) comes, there will be no ""invisible"" or ""safe"" bridge between your ability to actually use your money and Bitcoin.

\- Therefore every government could easily make Bitcoin worthless, and impossible to use, all they would need is a law and a script which simply prevents you from buying or selling bitcoin with your  digital money.

Yes I think greenpeace's take is awful by trying to get bitcoin devs / miners to switch to a different consensus algorithm, but when people say, ""Bitcoin is good for the environment"" it's just bad optics.              

The majority of bitcoin mining is done with green energy, we know.             

When non-bitcoin-people look at bitcoin and think of mining, the first thing they think is, ""Oh no, CO2."" What they don't know is when there is methane being emitted in to the atmosphere, that shit is 20x more damaging to the atmosphere than Co2. When mobile miners move to capture that methane and burn it to produce energy, that's when the ""planet-saving-move"" is made.            

There can also be very large differences between the amount of energy produced by a power plant, and then how much actually makes it to the grid and then gets used by people like you and me. Bitcoin can and is being used to make sure that the unused difference in energy can be put to use.",0

197,Bitcoin,"My long term understanding of the world of finance and politics is that 50 years from now, Bitcoin will be one of the monetary exchange mediums and perhaps even a unit of account for a part of the planet Earth. Perhaps the West will adopt it on a nation state level (not necessarily ordinary people or legal tender stuff like El Salvador) and use it to trade ***trustlessly*** with other nation states, and it will be one of, but not the only, store of value. The fact that it can be exchanged into any currency while not being dependant on any nation is very interesting and is probably the only truly neutral form of money that exists. Gold isn't neutral, because it is slightly inflationary and can be mined arbitrarily. OK, BTC is inflationary as well, but it is very much predictable.

Then 100-200 years from now, that is the true test of this project. If it passes all the tests, then it could become what people like Saylor are talking about. So far it has been extremely resilient, but to be honest I do not see it as an end-all be-all solution as many people are making it to be. The transaction space is extremely limited, as IT SHOULD BE. Also, it's completely publicly transparent. Yes, the other networks like LN are making transactions a lot better and cheaper and scalable, but still, if you run napkin math and try to calculate how long it would take 7-8 billion channels (one for each person) when one block can take only about 3000-4000 transactions, you will find that that is a huge issue. 

This is where other projects could step in, or even national currencies. BTC will become expensive to move eventually, maybe not for large institutions but for retail investors it will definitely be. And it will once again be useful to have ""paper money"", e.g. some shitcoin or national currency backed by BTC that can be exchanged into BTC. 

I don't buy into BTC maxi's theory that BTC is going to be everything. The main chain simply does not support scalling for 8 billion people, unless some sort of innovation/BIP comes along that makes it possible for people to be onboarded without touching the main chain.",0

Right now Apple Pay users can only pay Visa and Mastercard point of sale terminals but with this integration Apple Pay users would be able to scan and pay any person merchant or bill on earth that uses a lightning invoice. This would mean an Apple Pay user who knows nothing about bitcoin could travel to El Salvador where everyone accepts lightning payments and they could pay for their goods and services by scanning a lightning invoice using their Apple Pay app.

This would make it so someone with absolutely no bank account selling food on the side of the road in El Salvador could accept payment from a tourist who uses Apple Pay.

*Ukraine burns, bludgeoned by the invading Russian...*

In 2-3 years, the global monetary system will look nothing like it does today, and not enough people are considering the details of such a rapid disintegration:

Commodities are collateral, and collateral is money. Russia’s commodities are considered sub-prime, while the rest of the world’s are considered prime. This means that the price of commodities are falling inside sanctioned countries like Russia, but are rising outside of sanctioned countries. Commodities traders outside Russia have to borrow more money because of the collateral mismatch. But both the commodity traders inside and outside sanctioned countries are getting margin called while commodities basis soars.

Fertilizer price outside Russia for example:

[Green candle through heaven's floorboards](https://preview.redd.it/jq29gqddyar81.jpg?width=920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c90f0423be09608dd8406615baad3dbd3fb41ac)

Here’s a quick list of major Russian commodities as world percentages:

* 10% oil
* 45% of potash (needed for fertilizer, most beauty products, manufacturing, etc)
* 5% Wheat
* 5% Nickel
* 4% Aluminum
* 4% Copper

So the spread difference in this commodity pricing inside and outside Russia can be taken advantage of by China, who will effectively benefit by whatever the spread amount is. They can then control their own currency’s inflation by selling US Treasuries to buy Russian commodities. And because China is NOT a sanctioned country, that means they can then sell these Russian commodities to Europe, the US, or any other country putting sanctions on Russia. If they don’t have enough mainland space, they’ll put them on the ocean, driving up logistics costs for the rest of the world but ultimately stabilizing the basis. This means commodity shortages in the West, especially Europe. All this will put enormous pressure on western currencies and spike inflation further.

Then there’s the refugee crisis. The last one in Europe (circa 2007-2015) brought 5M people over those 8 years. Ukraine could bring 2x that in a fraction of the time. Then because of the coming food crisis thanks to much of Ukraine’s resources going offline, the Middle-East and Northern Africa will bring another huge wave. The last immigration crisis brought Brexit and an entirely new European political class. This will do the same, and will put more pressure on the Euro if their money printer’s heat doesn’t burn down their treasury first.

Here’s a quick list of major Ukraine commodities as world percentages:

* 11% wheat
* 13% maize
* 10% potatoes
* 10% potash
* 80% of neon gas (needed for semiconductor lasers)

This is all beyond any western Central Bank’s ability to backstop or fix, because it’s not a liquidity crisis. The inflation from the soaring basis will have to be cooled with rate hikes. But if that’s the case, where does money turn to for safety if the stock market is tumbling, Treasury demand has fallen off a cliff, USD/EURO is inflating away, and commodities are volatile? Real estate? Probably not because although interest rates will still be too low for savers at say 3% (because inflation is 10% or more) these rates will start to be too high for the easy money real estate borrowers are drunk on.

Many countries, companies, and players (especially in the East), will turn to the Yuan as a larger percentage of their cash holdings seeing it no less dangerously than they do the USD after G7 nations foolishly seized a sovereign country’s (Russia’s) foreign reserves, and because it's not inflating as rapidly, and most importantly, because they're buying those re-routed Russian commodities with it. This is where the petrodollar can start to really breakdown, adding more inflationary pressure on the USD. Many country's will turn to gold as well.

I won’t get into the Triffin Dilemma here, but its doom vortex is churning the USD into an impending disaster as early as winter this year and into the next couple years. Triffin predicted eventually the USD would collapse like this after it had backed itself into a corner.

And this is why 2022 is an important year for bitcoin accumulation, because more than anything, many large players will choose to hedge and save their buying power in bitcoin, and buying power is the most powerful tool for investors and traders.

Sanctions serve absolutely no purpose other than SYMBOLISM, because they erode supply chains further, benefit China, strengthen their currency, and make you and I pay for it with ours. YOU are the one financing this conflict and these sanctions, which is why I needed to write this post, to give some perspective. This is why you have to make the asymmetric trade for bitcoin every time you touch US dollars THIS YEAR. There’s a disaster coming and we’re sleepwalking into it. You have to ask a very hard question: did Putin actually miscalculate anything with his invasion in terms of larger goals?

Lastly, you have to consider the fact that the CBDC does not fix any of the USD’s larger global problems. None. In fact, they make them worse because a CBDC is not actually fungible money. My view is that CBDC’s will be used to pay entitlements and be either spent quickly, or converted into what people save their wealth in at a small premium: bitcoin, a network which will simply be the base layer that the new monetary system builds around--and this dear reader, is a base layer that’s been missing for quite some time.",0

When discussing BTC, I believe this fact concerning a finite quantity of BTCs is frequently overlooked. This feature, in my opinion, will be the most important in the future. It's difficult to believe that we could ever utilize a currency that is unaffected by inflation. Today, we are dealing with a significant level of inflation, which we are attempting to combat.

As we all know, making the shift from FIAT to BTC will be challenging for our monetary system, so perhaps adding another step in the middle would help. I'm referring to the use of stablecoins as a normal currency. It doesn't matter if it's linked to the US dollar as USDT, BEAN, or to Chinese Juan. This might make the transition easier and safer while also reducing the chance of banking institutions collapsing.

The BTC network is projected to become stronger as it supports the expanding community, with just 2 million BTC remaining to mine as rewards and an inflow of Bitcoin miners from all around the world.

This write up will contain information about **where we are in the world**, the **role Bitcoin will play** in it, and most fun - **Price Predictions!** I've spent over 1000 hours trying to wrap my head around this revolution. **Let's begin.**

The Internet has changed the world forever in such a small period of time. People forget the internet became a global sensation only in the **1990s**, and look how far it's come.

The entire **WORLD** now runs on the internet, and **WILL** continue to run on the internet.

We are currently living in ***The Exponential Age*** at this point in history. Technology is evolving the world at a rate faster than ever before in HISTORY. Simply put, the world is moving at light speed.

Shown in the graph below, the internet is the fastest developing idea/product in the entire world.

[The Exponential Age](https://preview.redd.it/cranvt6775r81.jpg?width=823&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ad30bdb8abaf44bbbba9e27180f497a50976908)

As a comparison, the distance of time between the creation of the Light Bulb and invention of the Internet is approximately **143 years apart.** The difference between the creation and Internet and Automated Self Driving Cars (FSD) is only is only approximately **30 years apart.**

Please let that sink in how complex it is to create AI vehicles that humans can trust to bring them to their needed destinations. Only 50 years before that we never could have even dream how to build such an idea.

**That one idea is only one of millions of innovations that's happened in the past couple decades.**

The internet has exponentially been solving problems since inception. Examples such as Social Media, Smart Phones, Artificial Intelligence have given the world a new way to connect, and forever interact with the digital world at large.

We are at a stage in technology where the internet has a literal voice. The internet is becoming an everyday citizen of the world. Check out ""Sophia"" the robot!

Now that we've explained The Exponential Age, where does **Bitcoin** fit in?

Bitcoin was created by an **unknown person** who went by the name ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" on January 3rd, 2009.  **Satoshi's vision** was to create the first EVER proper form of **Digital Money.** This Digital Money needed to have a fixed supply, be secure, and permissionless. With **Bitcoin**, there is not a  single person in the **world** that has the power to turn the system off, alter or block a transaction, or alter the max supply of this new currency.

**System never turns off**: Digital Money that runs 24/7 for the rest of Human and AI's total existence.

**Be Secure**: It is impossible to exploit the network, change the network, or devalue the network.

**Fixed Supply**: It is mathematically impossible to devalue the money against itself. There is no inflation.

On **Dec. 13, 2010,** Satoshi officially resigned from working on Bitcoin and handed the project off to the world to complete. Bitcoin's core values had already been set, and it was up to the world to keep it safe, secure, and forever running.

**Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is running flawlessly, and is absolutely thriving in adoption. Nobody knows who Satoshi is today, or if he's even alive.**

Currently, Bitcoin usage is growing at an exponential rate, as information about it and it’s ease of access is taking the world by storm. Check out this chart displaying how the Bitcoin adoption is growing at the same speed as the adoption of the Internet. We've already hit a $50,000 BTC in 2021!

[Internet Adoption VS 2020 BTC Price](https://preview.redd.it/jz8ygjrf85r81.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16f2cf261ab4ca05369b9bba49f476ba1bd05553)

We can also see the Bitcoin number of Active Addresses (Users/Wallets) increasing exponentially as the price rises (bringing more attention to the asset)

[Active Users vs BTC Price](https://preview.redd.it/13wptisk85r81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bef9acec8c845d93d742583340dd88876a4ba45)

Adoption is moving fast. But why does the world even need Bitcoin anyways?

The world technically **revolves** around Money. Money and economic incentives drive the world to be forever evolving space, as well as allow us to earn resources needed to live. Currently, the entire world is being plagued by money that is being devalued, assets that are being inflated, and people who are losing faith in the current system. People are getting desperate, they’re looking for an alternative, it’s getting bad.

Bitcoin is the solution to these peoples problem, and very fast are many starting to notice. If you're reading this in 2022, check how **EARLY** we are, and how exponential we are about to grow. Congratulations to all BTC holders out there. 

[It's about to get crazy.](https://preview.redd.it/qn8z2e3r95r81.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a6b9c383aff593ff1505f1e98f1ffa344e2904c)

Billionaires are buying it, country’s are adopting it as an official currency, the US government is accepting it for tax payments, and the world is trying to go greener to acquire it. The list goes on. This is all happening within a short decade. The demand for Bitcoin will only continue to accelerate from here. 

The toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube. Bitcoin is taking the world by surprise and there is no stopping it. The world’s finally taking advantage of this fair, secure, and incorruptible money. The world is learning to store its wealth on the Bitcoin network. It is a **black hole** sucking up the world's corrupt, controlling, and unlimited supply of Government money. **People are taking back control of what hard earned money is all about.**

*Bitcoin is digital gold, it is financial freedom, and it is the future of economic energy.*

Theoretically, because Government money has an unlimited supply, the price of Dollars per Bitcoin can go to infinity when compared to it as Bitcoin has a max supply. So why do we want to get in early?

The reality is, governments cannot stop printing money. It is impossible to stop printing money, and with Bitcoin having a forever fixed supply of 21 million coins, it mathematically will 100% continue to rise in value against a currency that has a maximum supply of infinity, assuming there is demand for Bitcoin. (The strongest currency)

Read what I said above again. The price of Bitcoin is literally going to *infinity* against the dollar. Bitcoin is number go up technology against ALL currencies of the world.

[USD vs BTC over time](https://preview.redd.it/u8rv3xvm65r81.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fdb5e06b8c92c8bda06e2400b5cc03a9095a86d)

Year after year, dollars are purchasing less, and Bitcoins are purchasing more. Bitcoin is exponentially increasing in purchasing power. Bitcoin mathematically is the strongest currency in the world. It is a perfect place to store long term wealth, and exchange economic value with another entity.

The question that lead many of us down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is, **how high can Bitcoin price go?**

**In Short, the price per Bitcoin valued against the Dollar should be anywhere between $500,000 and $4,600,000.**

That's right, Bitcoin is EASILY going to 1 MILLION DOLLARS a coin by 2030. We are so early. The world has a lot of money in it. The world's money is beginning to fly into Bitcoin as we speak.

[Public Companies holding BTC](https://preview.redd.it/12r5kf7xd5r81.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c412f2e88af206e218bf174a03eb32c53f71a3)

The chart above will show us that Public Companies are beginning to HORDE Bitcoin, as they see it as an essential asset to hold on the balance sheet of their business. Many of these companies are taking Bitcoins off the market, and they will NEVER return or be resold for dollars.

Bitcoin is the easiest asset to maintain, and the greatest asset to hold over a long period of time. Everyone is making a lot of money off this. Everyone needs a piece of it.

The kicker is, we are going into a transformational time in history. Inflation rates are at record highs, reaching 10% a year in most of the world. (This is conservative) 

The Global BOND market is worth approximately $100T. All this money placed in bonds is literally LOSING investors money. If inflation is at 10%, and you are earning 2% on your bonds, you are *""safely""* losing 8% a year on your investment. The math is that simple, and it is that sad.

We can now say at least 30T of these bonds are smart enough to notice within the next couple years that the money placed inside them need a new home, the whole Crypto industry and Bitcoin itself is that black hole that is going to suck up a large portion of it. (Crypto Industry is currently only worth $2.5T at the time of writing this)

**With all this money coming, and adoption growing exponentially, what prices per Bitcoin could we expect?**

Maybe this is something for you to study yourself, but I'll give you an idea of models and ideas to study to get you on the right track.

*These Price Projections, Models, and MATH have been provided by* ***James from InvestAnswers****. Check him out on YouTube!* [*https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgJyzwGs-GyaNxUHcLZrkg*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClgJyzwGs-GyaNxUHcLZrkg)

**Price Projections by 2030** 

* Metcalfes Law: $11M per BTC
* Stock to Flow: $9.5M per BTC
* Fidelity and ARKK Invest PP: $1M
* Average of all the models: $4.6M
* **Expected Case: $1.9M**

I like to give conservatives price predictions for BTC. Realistically, any of these could be correct. The math just works, it's not hopium, it's not inaccurate, this is REALISTIC.

**I expect a $1M Bitcoin by 2030, and I have put my money where my mouth is.**

The question is, should you invest? Yes. NFA!

Take a leap of faith, this is all very possible, and will likely happen.

[A leap of faith!](https://preview.redd.it/hjq549o0j5r81.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e74c8107fbf7f7ec2450bf3330b9d62439813a6f)

Keep in mind, Purchasing Power of $1M in 2030 will not be $1M. This is true because of how inflationary the dollar is. See below what happens when BTC = $1M a coin with varies inflation rates. This is why we need sound money that does not devalue against itself. (Bitcoin if you haven't understood that yet)

Get ready to see Bitcoin being accepted as payments at all your local stores, and sent between all your friends. It's only up from here. Bitcoin and Crypto as an industry is a 50X opportunity from here over the next decade or two. This $2.5T asset class is going to $100T. (Similar to the Stock Market and Real Estate total market)

Study hard, study often, pick the right assets, and enjoy the gains.

The question is: ***WHEN MOON?*** Stack your bags, do your DD, and happy investing!

Again, NFA!

From what I was able to research myself, it looks like complete bullshit. He would have had to mine 5 months completely alone in order to have this sort of stash. And it does not look that Bitcoin was solo mined (even in 2009) at all. Everything else that Satoshi did points towards the fact that he did everything in order NOT to have any personal gain from the project. 

For example, the earliest blocks show that there are times where there is no mining whatsoever. It means that there are days where even Satoshi wasn't mining, as he didn't want to reap the rewards if he was the only one mining. I assume he would then turn on his miner when somebody else joined the network in order to ""compete"" with them and strengthen the network. So, yes, he for sure has a stash, but 1 million is such an insane theory. If anything even little research proves that he had the intent of making the network as strong as possible, not to benefit himself. 

On top of that, there is no single wallet that is bigger than 250k coins which is known to be a Binance wallet. Although it is possible that he would create new addresses and occasionally change the reward address of his miners.

EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism

Lawmakers are set to end even the smallest anonymous crypto transactions, and plan measures that could see unregulated exchanges cut off.

European Union lawmakers voted today in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions, a move the industry said would stifle innovation and invade privacy.

More than 90 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal, according to documents seen by CoinDesk.

The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 ($1,114) to the crypto sector. They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.

National governments said in December they wanted to scrap the EUR 1,000 threshold for crypto, on the basis that digital payments can easily circumvent the limit, and to include private wallets that aren’t operated by regulated crypto asset providers.
This is trash, truth be told. We need Web3 platforms like Point Network to focus more on privacy so that we will see how this type of rule works. 

 
Members of the center-right European People's Party (EPP) opposed many of the more controversial changes, condemning what they called a “de facto ban of self-hosted wallets.”",0

1. Crypto in cryptocurrencies does **NOT** mean encryption
2. Digital wallets do **NOT** store your cryptocurrencies. They simply store your private/public keys
3. Since wallets do **NOT** store your coins, a transaction does **NOT** send or receive coins. A transaction simply changes the ownership of coins and writes this info to the blockchain
4. Hashing is **NOT** encryption
5. Digital Signatures are **NOT** encryption
6. Using CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs are **NOT** profitable for Bitcoin mining (ASICs rule that world)
7. Elliptic Curve point addition is **NOT** multiplication
8. Bitcoin's elliptic curve secp256k1 is **NOT** a NIST Curve
9. Bitcoin does **NOT** use RSA encryption
10. Bitcoin does **NOT** use RSA signatures
11. Ethereum is **NOT** Proof-of-Stake, it is Proof-of-Work like Bitcoin
12. There can be at most 21 million Bitcoin but Ethereum has **NO** such limit
13. You **CAN** have smart contracts using Bitcoin but you are limited in such transactions because Bitcoin scripting language is **NOT** Turing-complete (which was a deliberate choice)
14. NFT images or videos are **ALMOST NEVER** stored in the blockchain (so they can get lost in the future and they can be changed if they are stored on a webpage)
15. Most NFTs are simply represented with their description and URI in the blockchain due to ERC-721 standard.

So in Yuval Noah Harari’s books (Sapiens, Homo deus, 21 lessons) he leads up to the point in 21 lessons that the current government system is not working because it is outdated technologically and culturally. 

Then I heard in a speech about Crypto how it is good because it allows people to freely move between systems of governance. 

Next I heard in a podcast how most great things can be explained using metaphors of nature. The way our society/economy/politics work is a lot like nature. The trouble with our political/economic systems is that many new laws/currency are added in but very very few are taken out (die) (In nature if a thing is continuously created and doesn’t die, it over consumes itself/environment).

Crypto is great because it allows value to be captured and distributed to its shareholders seamlessly and even transferred to a different system of governance if you lose interest in the previous coins governance system and applications. 

This will continue pushing forward better and better systems of governance that attract users by offering increasingly better utility.

In turn this will leave our current political/economic system into the stone-age and bring a new era of increasingly improving governance systems that make US the people more happy (captured value distributed properly)

I think there will be a push, at some point, for a bank or institution to fractional reserve bitcoin.  Lend out more than they have, essentially.   They would do this the same reason they wake up everyday... to manipulate the market in their favor.  

Bitcoin is supposed to level the playing field.  But we gave to maintain diligence and do our best to track corporate bitcoin, spending, reserves, and ideally transactions.   No one corporation can and should be trusted so long as profits &gt; people.

319,Bitcoin,"First time posting. I’ve been investing in this company since June last year. With all the concerns around the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, I went with these guys over other miners because they generate their own electricity with hydro power plants they’ve purchased. Not to mention, last year they mined 3453 Bitcoin at an average cost of $8100 per coin. Their latest financial statement looks great, in 2021 they generated $169 million in revenues and gross profit was $111 million. 
My question now is why isn’t anyone else talking about this? It’s a green energy miner with extremely low production costs, currently expanding their hash rate and power generation capabilities to produce more Bitcoin faster and at a lower cost. The company posts production updates on social media and there’s almost no reactions or comments on the posts. Watch all the stock market news channels and none of them mention this company that has a market cap of $769 million. It’s about time this stock gets the respect it deserves.

When I was young my father left and my whole family became homeless. For the past 5 years I have lived in my car and worked at the lowest paying dead end jobs.

Right now I don't have a job. You may ask why and the reason is when you are working a dead end job that won't give you a raise you make more money quitting and taking a few weeks to find a job paying $1 more per hour.

I can make enough to afford an apartment but because the rent price means they require 3X rent as your income... I don't make enough for that.... So I can't get an apartment.

I have worked and quit and worked and quit and repeat.

Right now My goal is to save up $30,000 and invest it in Bitcoin. That means if Bitcoin becomes 500K then I'll have $300,000... And I can retire with that in the Philippines.

I can theoretically save $15000 in a year working while living in my car so I plan on investing ALL of it in Bitcoin.",0

My friends and I recently started [Finsheet](https://finsheet.io/), which provides financial data for spreadsheet users.

We have real-time and historical price for Bitcoin in many leading crypto brokers. For example, these functions would return real-time price of Bitcoin on Binance and Coinbase:

* FS\_Latest(""BINANCE:BTCUSDT"")
* FS\_Latest(""COINBASE:BTC-USD"")

These 2 functions would return intra-day (1 hour) price of Bitcoin from the beginning of today (04/01/22) until now:

* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""BINANCE:BTCUSDT"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")
* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""COINBASE:BTC-USD"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")

We have both [Excel](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200003886) and [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/realtime_stock_and_crypto_price_finsheet/574480000400) add-ons. They are super easy to use and require zero coding.

The website is totally free right now. You just need to register an account and install the add-on to get started.

I really appreciate if you guys can check it out and provide any feedback you may have so that we can improve the website better. Thanks in advance.",0
329,Bitcoin,"I have some friends that consider me greedy but I do not consider myself greedy.

Me: I accumulate dollar bills from work, and with those dollars, I do not buy wants. I buy needs that will help me survive. The money that is not spent on needs is INVESTED into bitcoin.

I do not invest this money for the sake of having a big number in an account, and I think this is what my friends think my goal is. To have a big number in an account.

This is not true.

My ultimate pursuit is to have complete freedom to do whatever I want with my time. I achieve this by saving and investing. By having a ""big number in a bank account"" it ensures that I do not have to work if I don't want to. The ""big number in a bank account"" is what allows work to be an OPTION as opposed to being a necessity.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends: They accumulate dollar bills from work, and with those dollars, they spend all of it on wants.

They operate under the assumption of: ""I'm just going to swipe my card and hope it gets accepted"" and ""I spend money now because I know it will eventually come back"" but there's no plan to back up this way of thinking other than ""hope"". They ""hope"" the money will come back but haven't formulated a plan to get said money back.

These friends also: always work all week because thats the only way they can afford their lavish lifestyle of eating out at dressing in new clothes. They get a check and think ""what can I buy with this check"" instead of ""I'm going to spend 50% of this check and invest the rest"".

Bottom line: my friends spend all their money on materialistic items, and they get this money from their paycheck every two weeks. At the end of the week, they complain that they are ""broke"" and they have to wait until next paycheck to purchase what they want.

The reason they chase money is to buy material possessions, but I'm the greedy one?

What constitutes greed?

Is the pursuit of money in order to buy material possessions greed?

Is the pursuit of money in order to maintain freedom of time greed?

Is the pursuit of money for the sake of pursuing money greed?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I considered greedy because I have a lot of money while having very little physical possessions?

Am I considered greedy because I don't spend my money?

Am I considered greedy because I have money, period?

Am I considered greedy because I have money while my peers do not have any money?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I greedy? Or have I successfully set myself up for the long term?",0

335,Bitcoin,"All the attention and reprimanding from mass media has finally gotten to Bitcoin miners it seems and many are trying to make a greener world and attempting to decrease their carbon footprint. 

CoinDesk recently run a report on a Northern Italian small municipality using hydropower to mine Bitcoin. 

“The northern Italian regions bordering the snowy Alps are home to dozens of hydroelectric power plants in a range of sizes, thanks to the abundance of water and varying altitudes. TRENTINO, ITALY – Daniele Graziadei, the 37-year-old mayor of Borgo d’Anaunia, a small municipality in the northern Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige, entered the 100-year-old Alta Novella hydropower plant with familiar ease. 

This year, under the leadership of Graziadei, Borgo d’Anaunia, home to around 2,500 people, became Italy’s first municipality to run a crypto data center.”

In fact, this is not the only case of its kind. Another Swedish village has been using mining rigs to power the electrical rig too. 

“Around 15,000 cryptocurrency mining rigs are humming away at HIVE Blockchain’s (HIVE) 30 megawatt (MW) data center in Boden, Sweden. But not all the time. Sometimes, the facility powers down to help the local grid.
The data center, drawing cheap energy from local hydropower producers, acts as one of the largest, if not the largest, active energy reserves the Swedish grid can call upon whenever there are major disturbances to the local power supply. The facility can shut down its machines almost instantaneously so that energy can quickly be diverted to public use.”

It now seems to be the case that Bitcoin and Bitcoin miners are not just decreasing their carbon footprint, but make the world greener too. 

Full disclosure, this could be even easier with the advent of DeFi into the scene. Once community-run DAOs get the upper hand in rule, people could actually vote for what comes to benefit them, rather than be bound by the choices of centralized corportations. Some DAOs like the Alps foundation, or Hive or even Aloha DeFi provide a new world for users all around trying to get the best of all these worlds. DeFi DAOs, NFTs and everything that will make the future cleaner, greener and better. 

The incentives between energy producers and miners are so aligned that soon it might be difficult to draw a line between the two.
More energy firms are entering mining, while miners are accumulating their own energy supply. Voltus has created models to determine exactly how much flexibility is worth to crypto miners: in Texas, $37.53 per megawatt hour, whereas in New England, it’s $6.69. per MWh.

Energy companies that stay out of bitcoin mining will leave money on the table, “because mining most of the time is much more profitable than selling the energy to the grid.”",0

345,Bitcoin,"I first heard of Bitcoin in the early 2010s, and for many years didn't bother to learn much about it.  Heard it was used by people to buy drugs on Silk Road, thought it was a hoax, etc.  Later on, about 2018 or so a friend of my girlfriend offered to bring me in on a multi-level marketing scheme to promote Bitcoin.  I easily saw through it, said no.  Considered getting into Bitcoin at that time, but figured I had missed out on the gains as it was so high priced (at $10k).  

In 2020, I was working as an accountant for a group of small businesses.  I helped our companies apply for the PPP program, which was part of the CARES Act.  We received the PPP loans, and my boss got $700k from Uncle Sam.  While he had to use much of it to pay things like payrolls that he didn't really need, he also used much of it for his own benefit - to pay things he'd have to pay anyhow, etc.  It was an amount of money nearly equal to what I'd saved for all my life, and it was just given to my (former) boss, a multi-millionaire many times over, and at the inflationary expense that everyone else would have to endure over the coming years.  I'm a landlord, I later had to raise my rents as prices of everything started to really rise and no tenants wanted to move out.  I got burned by the eviction moratorium by a tenant, for a few months in late 2020.  

It became very clear to me that the financial fuckery was real, and that the US dollar was the mechanism by which it was made possible.  Take away that dollar, the fuckery must stop.  That's what brought me into Bitcoin.  With Bitcoin, no govt could give that kind of money to people like my former boss(who by the way has developed a totally entitled mentality and believes he deserved every penny of it).  With Bitcoin, prices of everything wouldn't be going up, they'd be going down or stable.

Otherwise, I guess it’s just another turn in the rabbit hole of my BTC journey.

2. Does this EU law apply for non-exchange transfers (peer-to-peer) and over the counter? Or is it strictly in regards to exchanges?

Because if so, this does bring huge concern (I'm not an EU citizen). But I think there may be legal (but awkward) loopholes around this. But perhaps that's for another thread. And I'm not really asking about the difficulties enforcing, and instead looking at how EU citizens can mitigate the effects while still being within the law.

Meanwhile, some interesting observations were made by Lark Davis (link below):

* Russians living in the EU who are sending funds to their family in Russia, I guess this would be instantly instantly affected.
* Regarding whales - in the event of a hacking breach, criminals would not only know this whales' name, but also their home address. The prospect of only being 24 words away from having tens of millions of dollars might be attractive enough to justify the cost of a plane ticket and a $5 wrench.

The University of Nottingham, UK have just announced their ground breaking new technology called ""CBI"" the Crypto Brain Interface, which enables the human mind to mine popular crypto blockchains using only the power of thought.

“As we all know the human brain is vastly superior in computational output to any computer we have today… We do this by scanning someone’s brain using Magnetoencephalography, or MEG and interfacing that with our Blockchain code.

The team hope to refine the process in the coming years, by linking several human brains together in what would become the first human neutral-network, called “The Hub”. They hope to achieve this neural binding technology by 2023, linking 1000 people together by which time their collective hash rate will exceed 36500 Th/s

“Our graduate team are proud to announce today our findings. So far we’ve only managed to achieve 92hs, which is on par with mining with a Raspberry PI 4, but it’s a good start!”",0

I was drinking coffee from the vending machine to stay awake because... work at 2am while going to college.  I would always push the cream and sugar button because I couldn't stand the taste of the brown drink.   After my 6 hour shift finished loading brown trucks, I went out with the driver for 12 hours (Christmas season) and he offered to share his coffee.   I tasted it and said...  WOW!  What did you put in this? It's amazing!  He said \*I still remember the exact quote\*  ""That, my friend, is Jamaica Blue Mountain! I didn't put anything in it!""  I was hooked....

My question to you:   I'm still into coffee and have really wanted to start selling coffee online with bitcoin (lightning network) being the primary and initial, probably only, payment accepted.    Who would do it?   I would.  Would you?   If yes, what would be your dream come true if you could whisper to someone who is going to build it (yo! over here!)  So...   there it is.

So I'm freshly getting into how Bitcoin works and learning about the technical details. There has been one thing recently that I don't get:

When talking about paper wallets, most people say that they aren't safe because if you want to look up how many coins are stored in the wallet, you would have to rely on a third party service and trust them with that.
But isn't this also true for hot wallets or other cold wallets like Tresor? As long as I'm not running my own node I'd always have to trust third parties right?

And if some form of software indeed is safer in that regard, couldn't I just import my paper wallet and solve the issue that way?

Bitcoin (BTC) – the world's oldest and [**biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation**](https://coinmarketcap.com/) – might have had its fair share of bad press in recent years for being a less than environmentally friendly crypto coin.

For example, last May, Tesla suspended its previous acceptance of the BTC token, citing concerns about BTC’s ‘[**rapidly increasing use**](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203)’ of dirty energy (coal, primarily, which Tesla said “has the worst emissions of any fuel”).

This decision sent the coin’s price plummeting. However, the electric car-maker continues to accept credit cards – even though, as [**data**](https://bitcoin.fr/public/divers/docs/Estimation_de_la_durabilite_et_du_cout_du_reseau_Bitcoin.pdf) from author and self-styled ‘Bitcoin evangelist’ Hass McCook shows, traditional banking in fact produces more than five times the emission of BTC.

In view of such findings, we have to ask: Is BTC’s bad reputation really justified?",0

475,Bitcoin,"In 2010/2011 the only people involved with btc were essentially hackers and coders and most played around with tens of thousands of btc thinking one bitcoin being worth $100 was an impossibility. Most of these people have relatively little to show for their early involvement, however a lot still became seriously wealthy.

2013 may have been the first year bitcoins longevity and potential was truly recognised widely as its awareness spread further into the sound money gold bug libertarian space. But even then putting $10,000 into bitcoin was a huge risk, the collapse of mt.gox showcasing how quickly money and market value could dissappear.

Someone in 2013 who was young enough to see bitcoins potential may have had a spare $1000 that they were comfortable to risk for the long term knowing a 100% loss was possible. If they bought the 2013 low at $100 that would have equated to ten btc.

Ten btc today is only worth $500,000. Not even enough to retire on let alone ball out on private jets. So the average long term OG bitcoin hodler that got in during 2013 is not yet even a millionaire.

There are some early 2011 whales with thousands of btc and a bunch of altcoin scammers that have accumulated thousands of btc, but the average OG hodler from 2013 is not even a fiat dollar millionaire yet.

2013 OGs will one day be considered whales but not yet, this is how early we are still. By 2030 ten btc will be considered an insane amount of bitcoin for one person to own, people with one btc will be considered wealthy, and the average person will manage to get their hands on just 0.0026 btc.

485,Bitcoin,"I would like to gift $1,000 worth of BTC to my friend's kid and say I want them to keep it until the little fellow is 18. So hopefully he can pay for his college or whatever :)

The only issue is I don't know how I should deliver to them. I keep my crypto in nanoledger, but I am not sure if I give them one to keep 18 more years. I was thinking about creating a paper wallet and give them on paper, but there is a lot of people saying paper wallet generators are not safe. Obviously I can't have them create a DEX account cuz we don't know what would happen with them.

Any suggestions?  


Thank you!",0
486,Bitcoin,"I have been studying btc for about 6 months now and I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the economic effects that bitcoin will have. However I am having a hard time finding in-depth literature as to how bitcoin works exactly. Including hashing , sha-256, mining, how exactly the code prevents fake btc ect. Does anyone have any good links that can point me about 500 hours further down the rabbit hole? At the end of this I’m hoping to understand every last bit of information there is out there about bitcoin.",0
487,Bitcoin," Before the war, I was engaged in bitcoin and lightning network in Ukraine. Check: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLightningNetwork/comments/s5g3ug/how\_to\_play\_rockpaperscissors\_for\_sats\_on\_telegram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLightningNetwork/comments/s5g3ug/how_to_play_rockpaperscissors_for_sats_on_telegram/)

Now  is the time to help with information. The media is just the tip of the  iceberg. Perhaps people who are now in trouble or despair are able to  make a more useful resource than official authorities, the media or  unknown organizations to steal grants. At one time, this happened with  Wikipedia. Decentralization is strength.

The resource is currently being created in Ukrainian: [https://mediaspora.land/wiki/Головна\_сторінка](https://mediaspora.land/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0)

Examples of articles we have created for today: [https://mediaspora.land/wiki/Зниклі\_безвісти\_%28Маріуполь%29](https://mediaspora.land/wiki/%D0%97%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BB%D1%96_%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%28%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%96%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%29)

Here  I will write (also you can) useful information for internally displaced  persons, refugees or just migrants. I would like to see it in a neutral  informational style.

In addition  to informational value, we (with my friend) tried to put bitcoin meaning  here. So, in our ranks there will be replenishment.

A little donation page: [https://mediaspora.land/wiki/Моядіаспора:Підтримати](https://mediaspora.land/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%96%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0:%D0%9F%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8)

Just  if Wikipedia gives knowledge. Then who will give experience and free  help in information? Now everything works spontaneously. I invite  everyone who is interested. And yes, in this resource I would like to  see bitcoin education.

Will people be able to create a mass movement (resource) similar to Wikipedia not only for knowledge, but to help each other?

Good luck to all!",0

490,Bitcoin,"Hi, 
I would just like to get something off my chest. I would say I am on the newer side of Bitcoin and I want to see other perspectives. I have confidence in bitcoin logically but I know A LOT of undereducated people who have biased opinions about bitcoin, probably based on the media/government. Their opinion about bitcoin is that it is used for black market organ trading, YouTube scammers, is horrible for the environment etc. I still feel like people think I am a dingus when it is discussed, especially when the price dips. I don’t think I have ever seen a positive article or perspective on any cryptocurrency from the “non-crypto” world. Anyways, how can I be confident that this thing won’t go to crap? China has attempted to wash it from its market. The SEC was talking about enforcing a capital gains tax for the “ultra-wealthy” to pay more tax but in reality they won’t be affected by it because they already hide money in non-taxable foreign accounts. How will I know the global government wont force its hand to kill bitcoin? We all just experienced the governments grip for the last 2 years! The internet is getting smaller. Freedom of information is becoming censored because it doesn’t make money. I don’t know. Is the world going to shit? Will the brainwashing work? Help me find hope!!!! 

( Love you Vinny if you are reading this 😘)",0

Right now we have three cities we are planning to stay in, but we can book an extra night in one of them (right now we have two nights in each). Between Venice, Florence, and La Speza which would you choose? We're planning to do the Cinque Terre train while in La Speza, but not sure if the area warrants more time than that to explore. We've already been to Venice but only for a short time while on a cruise, and while we have been to Florence it seems like the main attraction will be historical areas which might not interest the kids too much.

The trip is in July and is for 5 nights. We’d like somewhere scenic that offers opportunities for rest/relaxation as well as excursions/adventure. We live in North Carolina and have lived in Florida, Kentucky, Southern California, and D.C. previously. So we’d like to skip those places.

So, where would you go? Bonus points if you’ve got ideas for things to do while we’re there. Plan our trip for us!

Some things we love:

* Fine/intersting cuisine
* Watersports
* Scenic views
* Lake/beach/river/pool options for swimming
* Luxurious accommodations
* Winery/distillery tours

1008,travel,"A friend and I are gonna be travelling to the Philippines in November. It was gonna be Korea but we decided to go to a cheaper country instead and then go to Japan. She thinks Japan will open their borders to tourists by November. I don’t think it’s gonna happen but I’m staying optimistic 😅. The other day we were talking about past travel experiences. I told her about the time I went to Japan with a mutual friend of ours. It brought back some bad memories that I thought I’d share.


Back in 2018 I traveled to Japan with a long time friend. We left on the 29th of December and stayed until the 25th of January 2019, just before Corona started. It was my first time travelling with him. I had known him for 12 years and I enjoy hanging out with him. We’re good friends but he is the worst travel buddy I’ve ever traveled with.

I made a list of places, activities, food that we can try/visit for each town/city we planned to visit. I did this as he didn’t want to do any research before the trip. He knew nothing about Japan but claimed that he loved Japan and anime. I made the list available in case we needed it, like as a guide, so we wouldn’t waste too much time google-ing where to go etc. We needed it but never actually used it.

In the mornings we would meet at the hotel for breakfast and to talk about our plans for the day but he never had any. I tried showing him the list I made but he never wanted to use it. He said it felt restrictive. So we had to hang out at the hotel and do research until he found something that interested him and this irritated me so much. If he had done research with me before the trip maybe we would not have wasted so much time.

Some days we were able to compromise and split the day between things that I liked, things he liked and the things we both absolutely needed to see. So there WERE some good days. I still regret going with him though, I feel like my holiday was ruined because of his poor planning or lack of.

The biggest thing that ruined a good chunk of the holiday for me was missing a lot of early morning or late night activities. Some examples are morning kayaking, watching the sunrise at cool places, early morning open fish markets, photoshoots at the bamboo forest, fireworks etc. We’re both into photography and agreed to visit places before they filled with tourists (early in the morning) so we could take photos. We never did. He could/would not wake up before 9:30 am so our sightseeing didn’t start until 11 am! So most days I just left without him and sent him directions on how to get to places and where to meet. We were both fine with this arrangement but a lot the of time, he showed up annoyed or in a bad mood because he had to go alone. He found it difficult navigating Japan.

He “disliked” commuting, using the trains or buses. We had to hire bikes on the first few weeks and used them to get around. When I got too tired of riding all over the place I just caught the train without him.

For a guy who claimed to love Japan he was very hesitant to try new things. We went to an onsen amusement park in Odaiba and he didn’t try any hot springs as he didn’t wanna go in naked “with a bunch of old men”. For some reason he was convinced that a bunch of old men were gonna perv on his big white cock in the onsen, like wtf. He stayed at the relaxation room and watched YouTube videos on an ipad while I explored the amusement park. Some Americans were having trouble with the signs and directions at the park and asked me for help. They were really nice, I ended up spending the next 4 hours with them so it wasn’t a total shit day.

Another thing the he refused to participate in was the nightlife. He doesn’t like the taste of alcohol so he never went out with me. I never suggested to go out drinking or anything, but he shut me down and said he doesn’t drink every time I invited him. I don’t know why but he thinks night life can only mean drinking.

I had known the guy for a decade but after the Japan trip I felt like I finally REALLY knew him. He had a lot of weird habits that were annoying/embarrassing.

The most annoying one for me was his eating habits. He told me he loved Japan but he doesn’t like Japanese sushi, in fact, he had only had tempura prawn sushi and chicken schnitzel sushi before the trip. That’s fine but the fact that he was not open to trying new foods made things difficult. We had to compromise a lot when deciding where to eat. On the days when I’m just too tired to look for a place to eat I would just let him decide and his choice was always McDonald’s or kfc. There was this traditional Japanese food tour that we both pre-paid for that he didn’t attend because he didn’t like anything on the menu. The trip went from morning until 10pm. It included breakfast, lunch, dinner and some bar hopping at night. I had to go by myself! After the first week he stopped trying to compromise on the food situation and decided that we should just have breakfast and dinner on our own. He had 7eleven pancakes or McDonalds for breakfast and McDonalds, KFC  or dominoes for dinner. His meal options was a bit limited imo so I guess we both found things about each other that were restrictive.

There’s also his man-spreading all over the place. He is a scrawny 5’9, not a small guy but not that huge either, he always took up so much space everywhere. He moved so slowly, was always late and he always had to bring his backpack everywhere all the time. He refused to leave any valuables at the hotel as he was worried the hotel cleaners would steal them. His mother lost an earring in a hotel in Thailand a decade ago so he thinks hotel staff are all thieves. His backpack was always heavy, he brought his laptop, camera + gear all the time. He was constantly inconsiderate and delayed the tour/sightseeing to dig through his backpack for some knick knack or something. Like why???? Just leave your stuff at a locker if you’re really so worried😫. This was a constant source of frustration and stress for me especially when we had to travel with a tour group. He was never shy to say, “hold on guys please” or “wait please I gotta take a pic”. There’s nothing wrong with doing any of that but he doesn’t need the group to stop for him, he can do it by himself and catch up. None of the tours moved too fast, we always had plenty of time to stop to do whatever. It was his constant rummaging through his bag for some random gadget that delayed him so much.

At one point during the trip I had to ask him for a day off every few days. I needed to holiday without him as he was getting on my nerves.

And then there’s his terrible time management. He had to work on the weekends. He is a programmer. He didn’t tell me he had unfinished work before we planned our trip to Japan. He needed the weekends to finish it. I feel like not telling me until we got to Japan was selfish and/or inconsiderate. I found out later that he had been working on the same project for 2 years and his dead line was 2 months before the trip. He couldn’t finish it because he procrastinated. How he was able to tell me about it and be completely clueless to how much that inconvenienced me and probably people at his job was simply incredible!

I love the guy but I am never travelling with him ever again. It’s not worth my mental health or my holiday. I’ve learned my lesson.",2

In few months, I plan to go backpacking around Europe as gift to myself for graduating. Probablly from November till I'm broke... 🤣

I'm thinking of going on budget, meaning that I will not spend money recklessly, I won't eat often in restaurants. Maybe only once a week to try local dishes. Also I'm going with a friend of mine, so we are planing to stay in private accomodation mostly. Sometimes hostels if private accomodation is too expensive. But we plan to stay in accomodation that is cheap(est). 2 beds, bathroom and stove is all we need.

Also we planned to take some cheap low-cost flight to some place thats is in corner of Europe (such as Portugal, Spain or France). And go country by country until we get home which is in Croatia.

Also we will try to save money on overrated museums, and tickets to things that doesen't interest us as much. 

We also plan to get fully vaccinated to avoid costs of tests. 

What do you think, realistically for how long could we travel with a budget of 3000€?

Looking for some general advice if possible please. 

My Girlfriends 30th Birthday is coming up next month and I’m looking to book a city break for her for sometime around the end of May. I was initially looking at Reykjavik but it’s a nuisance to get flights from here for that time so looking at alternatives. 

I’m not looking for anything too specific really but just somewhere that would be nice for couples to go with plenty to see and do. Planning on going somewhere for 4/5 days. 

I’m thinking of Dubrovnik if anyone’s been there and can give some insight as to what that’d be like for couples that would be great otherwise I’m open to suggestions - would love to hear your favourite city breaks.

My gf and me would like to do a roadtrip starting at  Los Angeles via Grand Canyon - Antelope Canyon - Las Vegas - Death Valley - Sequioa - Yosemite - San Franciso and then with a stop or 2 via Highway 1 along the coast back to LA. We have 3,5 weeks time.

In 2016 I did the same trip with a few friends in 3 weeks. But back then we did it in March. Temperatures varied from 25° celsius  till nearly zero in Sequioa for example. That was fine. Prices for hotels etc. were also fine. 

I read now, that in August everything is way more expensive and also the (at some places extreme) heat is an issue. That would make hiking in the national parks hard and August is in general not recommended as the best travel time.

Issue is, ma gf is a kindergarden teacher and has holidays according to when the kindergarden is closed. We do not have another choice than to go in August. 

Did amybody reading this ever did that trip in high summer and can share the experience? Is it worth it and doable?

1040,travel,"Hi everyone! I am planning on traveling to Europe and staying there for the month of May. I am a recent college grad and I'm on a pretty tight budget. I've looked into workaway, aupairworld, etc. Right now, I have the option of spending 1 month in Barcelona, living at a community center-type place, volunteering two times a week (12 hours total), and paying about $18 a day for accommodation, food (I believe every meal but I have to check), and laundry. This would come out to about $560 for accommodation/food for the whole month. I also have the option of working at a hostel in Prague for a month (25 hours a week) and getting accommodation for free (but not food).

Obviously, going to Prague is financially better for me but Prague wasn't my first choice of where I want to stay. I definitely had my mind set on Barcelona but given that I haven't been able to find a living situation similar to Prague, I am feeling a little discouraged. Also, the Barcelona setup will result in me sharing both a room and a bed.  I am fine with sharing a room but I think I'd definitely have to get used to sharing a bed with someone I don't really know.

Just some extra context, I am a PoC and I feel that my experience would likely be better in a country like Spain rather than the Czech Republic (although I could be completely wrong).

I would love to get some thoughts on what I should choose + why (e.g. why Prague is a good place to live/why Barcelona is a good place to live).",2

1. Can I leave the airport with a Dutch passport? And do I have to do anything first? I am double vaccinated and I'll have a PCR-test going to Bali of course
2. Can someone recommend me a place to sleep? I am a very adventurous young girl, and I can sleep in a public place if needed, but perhaps there are cheap places to sleep instead in and outside of the airport? If not, where can I best sleep in public?
3. Can someone recommend activities in Singapore after 17:00? Is there like a tour bus, or should I just take public transport and head to the city itself? I'd love to see the Gardens by the Bay!
4. Is there a place where I can store my luggage for the time being?

I (24F) and my partner (25M) have been wanting to see Japan for years.

We are SO EXCITED.

HOWEVER, this trip is scheduled for early June, and Japan still isn't open to tourism. So, we're starting to get a little nervous and figure we should consider backup plans. Please help us come up with a new plan, just in case our dream of seeing Japan falls through! 

We love being active, exploring, eating good food, and partying, and we're both scuba certified if needed. 

We're from the US and really just want something where we can be immersed in essentially another world! We've both already seen all of the US (except I haven't been to Hawaii yet), and we've also both seen most of the Caribbean and spots along the Mexican coastlines. Neither of us care to see Germany, England, or France at this time in our lives. 

We've considered Thailand, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Spain, and potentially Peru. But what else? Is there anything specific we should consider regarding these countries that can maybe guide us towards an answer? 

I'm about to start medical school which means our lives will be over for a while after this trip!!!

Due to proximity, I have selected the following cities to explore:

Fly in to Florence -&gt;

Florence/Tuscany?: 3 days
Milan: 2 days 
Lake Como: 2 days 

Bus back to Milan, fly back -&gt; 

I’m having trouble with the order of the destination as well as the logistics for Florence specifically. 

It’s really important that we get in the country side when we’re at Florence- do you recommend I book a hotel in the countryside, or book one at core Florence and travel to the countryside as a day trip?  I don’t know much about the geography, but want to keep long travelling times to a minimum. 

If we do book a hotel in Tuscany countryside- is three days far too long for the stay? Is the travel directly from the airport to the countryside (or another region) too ambitious? Finally, do you have any hotel recommendations?

I’m also worried about the travel back from Lake Como to Milan and to home. Is there a better way I can do this?

I'm genuinely baffled. I have a previous Schengen Visa from France, and stamps from another non-schengen country. This was a costly process and the visa alone has costed me 164 euros, let alone the flights and hotels.

I'm planning to travel to Mexico at the end of October this year (22nd to the 5th of November). I'm flying in and out of Mexico City.

- 5 days in Oaxaca city ( will be there for the day of the dead) (Looking at a night bus from Puerto Escondido)
- 2 days Mexico city (fly from Oaxaca)

I'm not sure if that's the right subreddit to ask.

I'm planning a trip to Italy, Rome and I'm looking at tickets... I found a flight that departures from Rome FCO at 6:15 AM local time.

Which means I'll have to be at the airport at 5:00 AM. With a quick search I see it takes roughly an hour to go from city centre to the airport (FCO). So, I'll have to leave my hotel room before 4:00 AM.

**Itinerary**

Day One: Fly into Lima

Day Two (Sunday): All Day in Lima, good food/drinks, biking around (have read they close off a number of streets on Sundays), normal sightseeing

Day Three: Day trip to Paracas through Peruhop.

Day Four: Fly to Cusco in the morning, spend the afternoon exploring the city, and acclimating to the altitude.

Day Five: All day in Cusco.

Day Six, Seven, Eight: Three-day trek to Machu Pichu including mountain biking, hot springs, and more. Vistadome train (plus other transportation included) on the way back to Cusco.

Day Nine: Recovery day in Cusco.Day 

Ten: Possibly another day trip from Cusco, or fly back to Lima earlier.

Day Eleven: Back in Lima, nice hotel and nice dinner.

Day Twelve: Fly Back.

**Questions:**

\- We will have two full days in Lima, do we need more? Same question for Cusco.

\- Is the Paracas day trip a good use of time compared to another day in Lima or another day trip?

\- Any suggestions for another Cusco day trip? Heard mixed things from Rainbow mountain but that's certainly an option. Or should we just spend another day in the city of Cusco? Or get back to Lima sooner.

\- Any specific neighborhoods to check out in either city? We will be staying in Barranco in Lima.",2

But, we are broke college students. We'll be flying budget and would want keep our hotel costs under $50/night.

The plan is to start in Alexandria, stay for a day or two, then catch the train down to Cairo and stay there for 3-4 days more.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to Marrakesh, Rome and other places where harassment and scamming are common, so I originally figured we would just wing it, keep a low profile and try to do things more independently. Well, I did some research and can see that Reddit has a hate-boner for Egypt...

I do think it's a tad exaggerated... There only seem to be \~5 big posts which everyone seems to link to of travelers' terrible experiences. But I think they have a point to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have seen, Alexandria seems fine. I think we'll stick to independent travels there.

Cairo; however, is where I am concerned. I'm worried about my girlfriend facing harassment, groping (or worse). She knows how to wrap a hijab like a professional, and she knows outfits have to be more conservative, but of course that only does so much. And if the scammers and salespeople really are more aggressive than in Marrakesh, dear god... Just end me now. Also, it seems like a tough-to-navigate city that is HUGE.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've seen, the best way to mitigate this is to hire a guide.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to do so, and would honestly love to plan a whole itinerary with someone far more knowledgeable about the local area. But, from what I've seen, this can cost $50+ per day. We don't really want or need an Egyptian history lesson, so an Egyptologist isn't super necessary. My philosophy is that at any famous site, you'll get better info from a book anyways, so just have a good experience, check it out and read later. I'd want to hear about current events and history more than anything. We'd also much prefer a younger guide, to check out local dives and just see how life actually is.

Our budget would be up to $20/day.

With this in mind, what would you guys recommend we do? Are there affordable guide services? Is there anything catered more to college students? Could there even be programs or exchanges done by universities in Cairo?

Edit: if exchanges of any kind do exist, I am 1000% capable and willing to host or guide someone in my own country in return.",2

I'll be traveling by myself for the first time in July and i really hope to get your input on my itinerary. Thank you in advance!


I'll be in France from July 8-25th ( I work nights at a hospital from 7pm to 7am, 7on 7 off and the opportunity to get 3 weeks off from work will probably never come, as I'm actively looking to change jobs and stop this graveyard shift killer of any social life 🫤)


Will arrive in Paris CDG airport around 8am(Friday), take the TGV InOui train to Avignon the same day(about 3hrs, I haven't thought through the details of this part yet). I spent the last 2 weeks researching the best places to stay in Avignon - Airbnbs, Vrbo, Google, Expedia, Booking.com, Capital One Travel, etc - and i finally booked 7 nights ( 8th-15th) at Best Western Plus Le Lavarin (10minutes from Avignon). I'm looking for true Provence vibe this segment and honestly i was really tempted to pay for a room at a villa surrounded by vineyards, but to get everything that i wanted - would have put me back 3000$ for 7 nights stay, so i compromised for this hotel and payed half of that. It has gorgeous gardens surrounding it, indoor and outdoor pool and sauna. The garden has so many shaded benches underneath old growth trees and i think I'll enjoy my time there. But anyway, I'll be out and about most of the time. 


So for 1 week in Avignon I'll be visiting the medieval villages and Roman architecture from antiquity in Luberon, Arles, Nimes, Orange ( the well preserved Roman theater and Colloseum, Pont du Gard, Palais des Papes, summer concert in Avignon, lavender fields) Vincent Van Gogh museum, Gigondas winery and the drive through Cote du Rhone, hiking and tasting wine and fresh fruits around that area, farmer's market on Tuesdays in Gordes, Mellon Festival in Cavallion (yummy 😋).


 Also, I'll make time to visit Aix en Provence( and Paul Cézanne studio)  and hike through the Massif Des Calanques, spending at least 1 hr on the beach admiring those azure waters ( for some of these segments I'll check All Trails and Civitatis apps).


On the 15th( Friday) drive to Nice and stay until the 19th in VilleFranche sur Mer or Cap Ferrat ( looking for places right now). While here, I'd love to see Villa Ephrussi with it's gorgeous gardens ( hopefully I'll get to smell peonies and roses), Eze and the cactus garden, walk the 4 miles Promenade Des Anglais by the Mediterranean sea in Nice, cocktails on the sandy beach in Antibes, hike through the hillside of Croix des Gardes Park in Cannes overlooking the gorgeous harbour. If there's time - check out the parfumeries in Grasse and hopefully get to see and inhale the aroma of multitude of rose and jasmine fields grown there by Dior, Channel and Hermes( probably not in season at the mid of July).


On the 19th(Tuesday) take the 6 hrs TGV train from Nice to Paris. Get there around 4pm - go get crepes on Champs Elysees or take an awesome selfie at the top of Eiffel Tower lol ( will have to register in advance for that).


On the 20th go to Giverny and visit the Claude Monet gardens(😍). On The 21st - the magnificent white cliffs of Etretat beach and the beautiful gardens. Spend the night there (about 2 hrs north of Paris by car) and the next day on the 22nd on my way back to Paris visit Le Jardin Plume ( which according to the popular British gardener Monty Don, is the most beautiful garden in France).


On my last 2 days in Paris I'll probably go to Palace of Versailles, Louvre and/or Luxembourg Gardens.


 I have to take a Covid test 24hrs before my flight leaves back to US on the 25th so I'll try a local pharmacy. Does anyone has any experience with that? ( But who knows what might happen until July with the new Omicron variant).


Hopefully driving and renting a car in France it's not too difficult. In Nice area and some days in Paris i won't need it, but to save time on other segments I'll have to rent a car. Any tips about driving or renting a car?

1140,travel,"Hi, I recently decided that I would love to travel somewhere solo preferably somewhere cheap and easy to get around to other places. 

I’ve seen that south east Asia and central/South America are really good options for this however I live in the uk and prices for flights to these places are really expensive. I was wondering what would be the best and cheapest way of doing this without paying a few hundred pounds just for a one way flight. 

Alternatively, I am up for other destinations that are cheap and suitable for a first time solo traveller, Europe is the obvious choice of course but I would love to explore a different continent.

1150,travel,"Hey r/travel,

We are landing at 11am at Heathrow Terminal 5 from the USA and our departing flight is in Terminal 3 to Prague at 1:20pm. Though our flights are both on British Airways, our flights are were not made on the same booking and so we will have to go through customs, pick up our bags, and re-check them.

In r/travel's opinion, is 11am to 1:20pm enough time to make the connection or is this not enough time? Thank you all ahead of time!

**edit:** Thank you all for your great advice! Unfortunately, British Airways has refused to combine the bookings and forward our luggage so we will have to go the slow manual route mentioned above. It is a short-haul flight so check in is 45 minutes before the flight.

This gives us 1hr 35m to de-board, pass customs, collect bags, transfer terminal (T5-&gt;T3), and check in our bags. That sounds very difficult to make, so we'll likely reschedule the flight. Our alternative is to take a flight 4 hours later.

**Asking anyone who has experience with BA customer support:** If we were to go the ""try to make it"" route and are not able to check in on time, how helpful will the British Airways ticket counter be in pushing us to the next flight?",2

Flew on United Airlines and had an early flight delayed by over an hour and the explanation the airline gave was they were having trouble getting enough staff to operate the aircraft. No mention of weather or anything like that causing it. The big issue is that this delay caused me to miss another flight, ultimately this led to what is originally scheduled as a trip that should have had me home at 10am into me not arriving home until 11pm the same day. Around extra 9 hours spent in the Chicago airport. I paid extra when booking the flights just to avoid this long layover time. Is it reasonable for me to expect some kind of refund for this?

Our group is 7 guys right now, may be as many as 10. A few of the guys are traveling from Chicago, but others are also traveling from Orlando, NYC, and Phoenix. I live in the Midwest, so am looking to go somewhere other than the Midwest, so not really interested in Wisconsin, Michigan, etc. That being said, somewhere that is easier to get to flight wise is a plus, I don’t want to spend half the day on flights to get to a very remote destination. Also, good transportation is a plus, whether that be taxis/Uber, public transportation, or walking, as we are unlikely to have a car. 

 We will be going in late July, and honestly, I don’t want to go somewhere where it will be sweltering hot and swampy, which pretty much rules out all of the south. 

The weekend will be pretty low key. Good food is key, as well as a good bar scene and/or breweries. Really enjoy good beer and a good cocktail. Hoping to also do some type of activity that takes us away from the bars for a few hours, eg rafting excursion, go karts, ATV, hiking, etc. 

Right now, some of the lead places I am thinking are Denver, Boston, or Baltimore. Denver has rafting less than an hour away, and Boston and Baltimore both have home MLB games the weekend we are going. Have thought about Seattle and Portland, but that’s a pretty long flight from the Midwest, and especially from NYC and Orlando.

We are already set in renting a vehicle for the week, but I want to rent a truck because 1) I think trucks are cool and 2) Tacoma is in Washington, so it just fits perfect to rent a pick-up truck. My main concerns with renting a vehicle in a foreign city is the traffic and parking situations. 

Since Seattle is the biggest city in Washington, I was curious if a small (Tacoma) to full size (Tundra/F150) is doable to drive around and park across Seattle on the street or (preferably) parking garages. 

Another reason why a truck would be best to rent for us is because we want to see if there are any national parks that allow for bicycle riding. Last year we visited Zion National Park in Utah and it was a blast taking in the views while bicycling around the park. We hope we can do the same in Washington, but we do not know any national parks that have bike rentals nearby. At least with a truck, we can carry them along using the bed of the truck.",2

1193,travel,"Hi all, 

Hopefully this question is okay! Happy to add further details, etc. if anything requires further clarification. 

My partner and I are looking to go to the Caribbean in the late Fall to celebrate my 30th birthday. This would be our first trip since the onset of the pandemic, and more than anything, we just want to be somewhere warm. We're planning on going for about a week, sometime between the last two weeks of October and the first two weeks of November.

Our basic criteria is: 

* Direct flight from Toronto (YYZ) 

* Safe for me (30-year-old woman) to go hiking, etc. alone

* Ideally not a cruise ship destination, or somewhere really built up by tourists (no McDonald's, Starbucks, etc. everywhere).

We truly want to 'get away from it all'. I'm more active than he is - I really want to be somewhere with good biking/hiking, he wants to get massages and sit on a beach with a drink. We're both interested in historical things, so we'd do that together. He'll join me for a hike or two, and I'll join him on the beach a couple times, but for the most part we want to be somewhere that will allow us to have separate adventures during the day, and reconvene in the evenings. Anywhere with animals is also a plus, because seeing an animals tends to make my day.

Based on my research, I've come up with three options - they all have their pros and cons, and I'm not sure which way to go. Any insights anyone may have, or alternate suggestions would be much appreciated!

**Option One: St Kitts &amp; Nevis** 

We would stay on Nevis, but would do a day trip to St Kitts at least once. 

*Pros*

* Seems to have the most bike rental/bike guide options of the three 

* Good mix of challenging vs. less challenging hikes

* Interesting history to check out with Alexander Hamilton, ruins of old plantations, etc.  

* Nevis is apparently safe

* Animals: feral donkeys, goats on the island. Also, monkeys. 

*Cons* 

* The beaches aren't the best

* Has been called ""less scenic"" than other Caribbean Islands

* Potential for hurricanes 

* Could require a car rental - driving is on the left side of the road, neither of us have done that before 

**Option Two: St Martin &amp; Saba** 

We would stay half the trip on Saba (spa, pool, hiking), and the other half on St Martin (beaches, biking)

*Pros*

* Hiking in Saba looks gorgeous

* St Martin has the best beaches of the options we're considering
 
* Switching between islands offers the best mix of my ideal vacation vs his ideal vacation

* The French side of St Martin is supposedly the best place for 'foodies' in the Caribbean  

* Saba is very safe, St Martin is mostly safe

* No car rental necessary 

*Cons* 

* Logistics of getting from Saba and back could be an extra headache

* Worried that my partner would get bored on Saba

* St Martin seems to be the most touristy of the islands we've considered 

* Potential for hurricanes 

* Not much in the way of animals

**Option Three: Curacao** 

We would stay outside of Willemstad, near Blue Bay. Would rent a car - and drive around to the different beaches, hiking points of interest, etc.   

*Pros*

* Lots of different options for beaches 'off the beaten path'

* Stay on one island the whole time, don't need to worry about ferries, secondary flights, etc. 

* Could splurge for one night at Baoase Luxury Resort

* Outside the hurricane zone, no need to worry about hurricanes

* Animals: flamingos, and apparently there's a beach where you're pretty much guaranteed the ability to swim near sea turtles  

*Cons* 

* Least 'safe' of the options (but still seems safe?)

* Most limited biking options

* Hiking looks nice, but more limited/less challenging than Saba/Nevis 

* Car rental necessary 

* Arid landscape vs. more lush, 'jungle-y' ones of the other options.

We're not troubled by the heat in beach destinations, it's more for when we travel to other parts of Europe that can get quite sticky at that time of year.

I’m struggling to wrap my head around how to cross the Serbia-Kosovo borders without having issues with the Serbian authorities. I will be landing at Nikola Tesla airport in Belgrade and then head south to Pristina. 

1) My first question is does somebody know whether Kosovo will stamp my passport?
2) could I ask the Kosovo border agent to stamp my Moroccan passport instead in order not to leave any trace of having visited Kosovo? The problem is that Moroccan citizens don’t have visa-free access to Kosovo like Canadians
3) if I do end up getting a stamp in Kosovo and I re-enter Serbia directly after, will I have issue when I’ll cross the Serbia-Croatia borders few days later?

Anyone with experience as a non-EU citizen at these borders please let me know!

**Concrete timing legs:**

* **September 14th-22nd:** Portugal (Porto, Lisbon &amp; Lagos)
* **October 2nd-5th**: Munich for Oktoberfest
* **October 10th-13th**: London

**Concrete places with loose timing:**

* **Ireland (\~One week)** Dublin/Galway and maybe Dingle
* **Paris (\~5 days**, including some time wine tasting)

The Ireland and Paris legs can be before/after Oktoberfest, but **we ultimately have about 5 extra days we need to plan**. We were originally thinking of doing Portugal -&gt; Ireland -&gt; Paris -&gt; Munich -&gt; Scotland -&gt; London, but that doesn't make much sense travel wise (back and forth), and we feel Scotland may be too similar to the Ireland &amp; London legs.

We've considered Scotland, Croatia, Austria and even Morocco. But really open to any and all suggestions for ""must sees"". It will be my first time really in Europe beyond Ireland.

I should mention that I am very loose when I do travel (book a place for a week, maybe plan a thing or two, but experience it slower while I'm out there), while my girlfriend is very Type A in her planning and wants things to do/keep busy, hence the amount of stops.

While we have travelled internationally before where we don't speak the language, it has primarily been huge city centers (Tokyo, for example) where english is relatively widespread. I'm pretty comfortable with spanish, but any tips for getting around France with very poor french? Or is it a non-issue?

2. We have never done Europe before, period. We will probably use the train system to travel between the cities and take day trips, though I'm not against renting a car for a day trip if necessary. Anything to know about the train system? I've been eyeing the Omio app.

3. We usually avoid traveling during peak season but we specifically wanted to be in Barcelona for a birthday this year, so. Anything I should be especially careful to book in advance, or is there anything where the lines are just going to totally outweigh the site?

4. Would love activity suggestions as well! For Marseille, we are considering day trips to the Calanques and Arles/Camargue as we are big nature lovers. Not as attached to the city sites themselves. For Barcelona, we're interested in the standard sites, but is there anything off the beaten path worth adding, especially considering peak season? Is a day trip to Figueres for Dali worth it?

I am staying in Give because I wanted to be close to the zoo as well and they had reasonably affordable airbnbs. Being that this is a solo trip, is renting a car absolutely necessary?

1284,travel,"Hi everyone. I am a 20 year old traveller who is going to be exploring Europe over the summer with my good friend (June 15 - July 4). We will be flying into Dublin on June 15th and I will be leaving by myself on the 4th of July, also from Dublin. There are a few decisions about our trip that I hope you guys will can help me out with.

Destination: Currently our trip destinations consist of Dublin, Barcelona, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Amsterdam. The space I left in that list needs to filled by another destination. We are thinking a city in Italy or maybe even Montenegro (although I've heard its very touristy). The city/town should have good nightlife (doesn't necessarily mean wild parties and clubs but at least somewhere to drink and meet new people). Historical landmarks and features are not a priority but a city with a rich historical backround would certainly be cool to see. We want it to be a place to explore. We will look at group tours but it would be preferable if there were fun activities that we could accomplish ourselves. Any suggestions would be great!

The other question that I have is regarding when I should leave Amsterdam to get to Dublin in order to catch my flight home to Calgary. My flight back home from Dublin leaves at **1:40 pm on Monday, July 4**. As it stands I will be in Amsterdam until the 3rd. I am currently considering two options to get to Dublin so that I will be able to fly back home on the 4th:

1. The first option is to fly to Dublin from Amsterdam on the 3rd and stay in a hotel overnight. I can  then wake up the morning of the 4th with tons of time to spare and no fear of missing my flight back home. This is by far the safest option. However I am on a budget and hotels in Dublin that say start around $150-200, which to me is much more than the $50 I am spending in Amsterdam.
2. The other option is to catch an early flight Monday morning from Amsterdam to Dublin. If I leave Dublin early enough this should give me enough time to go through security again at DUB and catch my flight back home. Currently there is a cheap flight that leave at 7:40 am from AMS and arrives in DUB at 8:20 am. Do you think this gives me enough time to check-in at DUB for my flight at 1:40 pm? Obviously my biggest fear is if the flight gets cancelled or delayed that morning then there is a chance I do not make it to Dublin in time and I miss my flight back home. And especially with COVID things are pretty unpredictable. Does anyone know if cancellations are common at AMS airport? 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated! I am very curious to see where people recommend visiting and what route I should take for the AMS to DUB decision. Thanks!",2

1287,travel,"I’m looking to book for September next year, travelling from UK for around 10-14 nights. 

I’m looking for any advice on whether it’s best to book package holidays since it can be a hectic trip. I have been to Florida twice before however travelled in a large group and stayed in villas. I was also younger so had no input in booking and then building an itinerary.

I’m wanting to do it all, Disney, Universal and Busch Gardens. We would want to do hotel stays since there is just the two of us but would want to rent a car. 

Generally when travelling to Europe for city breaks or beach holidays I am great at finding the balance between standard of hotel and price through thorough research and booking separately but I’m questioning it on this occasion.

Advice would be appreciated on thoughts such as:

Should I book a package deal? 
Should I book separate but possibly miss out on extras that make the trip simpler in terms of location/travel/catering?
Where is the best place to look for park tickets? Should I buy these in advance or is there deals I should watch out for in the time running up to the trip? 
Is it best to rent a car or is there shuttle transport? If there’s shuttle for; let’s say Disney, is it easy to get to universal etc from hotels in the Disney area? 
I’m expecting to be paying around £2000-2300 for flight hotel and park tickets and then £1000-1800 depending on the catering situation and any extra attractions like upside down house which I hope is still there because I thoroughly enjoy! Is this realistic? 

Any advice appreciated!",2

1289,travel," New poster here. This is a long post so I apologize

I currently live in Western Australia and I am planning a solo trip to Europe, hitting Helsinki, north to Lapland, west to Tromso, south to Oslo, east to Stockholm, south to Copenhagen, south Hamburg, maybe east to Berlin, west to Amsterdam, then fly to Reyjavik before coming home over a period of 6-8 weeks.

Goals for Finland, Norway &amp; Sweden are to be in the cities for 2-3 days each, then head out in the countryside to experience winter, see lakes, the coastline &amp; especially the Northern lights (for a total of 15 days or so), then tour Copenhagen &amp; the small towns &amp; castles of Denmark for 3-4 days then both German cities &amp; the surrounding towns &amp; castles for a total of 6-7 days, then Amsterdam &amp; the countryside, particularly smoke little (legit just a little) weed, see the Red Light District &amp; the windmills for 3-4 days, finishing in Reyjavik for the glaciers, ice caves &amp; volcanoes for 3-4 days. Plan is to go in either in the October-November 2023 range or the February-March 2023 range

My questions are:

1. Is this a recommended travel itinerary? I want to hit Amsterdam &amp; Germany in the late autumn/early spring when it's not blanketed under snow but still experience the winter of the Nordic countries. But experiencing winter all at once will probably be exhausting and I like the idea of going east to west across the map. That said I am flexible on experiencing the itinerary in reverse.
2. Budget. Does $10000 USD cover everything (including travel)? I am not a drinker or smoker but sampling the local food &amp; some sightseeing is a must. And I will be living in cheapish hotels or airbnb, but not in any youth hostels &amp; I will be buying a 10 day Eurail pass. The website calculates 9 days of actual travel
3. Considering the itinerary above, do you recommend going in October-November 2023 range or the February-March 2023 range

Your thoughts? Thank You for reading and replying

EDIT: After some thought and chat with family, I have decided to increase my budget to at least $15000 USD. With extra just in case I come short or really want to do something. Thanks to all of you who posted about the budget. Please let me know more about the countries during these times of the year. Thank You",2
1290,travel,"**About us:** Husband and I are mid/late 20's from the US.  We'd be flying out of Chicago on September 1st or 2nd.  Both fairly novice travellers - he has never been to Europe.  He wants to see some historical/cultural landmarks and architecture and eat some really good food.  I like those as well, but am also more drawn to beautiful natural scenery, especially swimmable waters. I also love major capitol/cultural cities like Vienna, Washington DC, New York, etc.  We want a somewhat relaxed pace and don't necessarily care about seeing ALL the sites.  A balance of seeing interesting historical sites as well as just vibing with a city/culture and eating good food would be ideal.  Budget is moderate.  This will essentially be a belated honeymoon for us, so an occasional splurge is fine.

Below are the general destinations we have narrowed our trip down to, with some questions and thoughts for each. Please help us pick a vacation!


**1. Andalucia Spain (and maybe Madrid?)**


Very interested in some of the history and architecture of this area.  We'd be willing to rent a car, so we could have some freedom to road trip/day trip.  It seems like there is plenty to do (and eat) in Andalucia if we take it slow.  

I've heard the Costa del Sol has lost a lot of it's authentic charm - is this the case everywhere or just around Malaga?  I'd love a day on the beach, but don't care for endless condos.  

Also, I'm interested in spending a couple days in Madrid before heading down to Seville.  Does that rush things too much?  Are we cutting too much into precious Andalucia vibe time if we do that?  Not sure how quickly we'd get bored in Seville/Granada.


**2. Portugal**


Portugal looks absolutely stunning to me, but I think my husband is under the impression that there aren't as many interesting historical sites as some of our other choices.  True?  

I'm also struggling to plan a ""chill"" 10 day itinerary, as I'm tempted to try to squeeze in the whole country.  Douro, Algarve, Porto, Sintra, national parks, smaller cities... How the heck do I pick?  (We'd most likely fly in/out at Lisbon, and I'm again willing to rent a car here.)


**3. Great Britain**


Probably starting in London and ending in Edinburgh, hitting up Bath and maybe York?  That seems to be the standardly recommended train route for 10 days in GB.  Any recommendations on other stops? (NOT willing to rent a car for this trip.)

I may feel like I am missing out on the warm/Mediterranean scenery, but I am sure I would still love this trip nonetheless.  I love a good grand, ancient church.  

Overall I'm a little less hyped for going to a British Isle than the other destinations, but husband seems specifically interested in this trip.  I'm also assuming that we'd spend more money here than in Spain or Portugal, so wondering how much more and would it be worth it?


**4. Copenhagen (and maybe Stockholm?)**


So I have a personal friend who was recently in Copenhagen and she convinced me that it's an amazing place to visit.  It seems somewhat lacking in specific attractions or historical sites, though?  Like most people who go there just vibe, bike, walk the canals, eat expensive food, etc.  Which isn't a bad thing.. just my impression.  Am I wrong? 

Speaking of expensive food, I am a little wary of how quickly 10 days in Scandinavia could add up, cost-wise.  I may cut the trip shorter to avoid ballooning costs and allow us to eat better food or stay in better accommodations during the time that we are there.

Also, would it be worth it to add on Stockholm?  (Especially considering my previous question about avoiding ballooning costs.)  And if we do, should we do Stockholm or Copenhagen first?  Since Copenhagen seems like the hot place to go these days, would Stockholm be comparatively boring or a let down after Copenhagen?  



Thanks for any advice/tips/strong opinions on these areas!",2
1291,travel,"So here is some context: my friend and I are travelling for about a month to Europe from Canada at the end of July. We want to see as many cities since it will be my first time in Europe backpacking and I want to be as frugal as possible (I know this will be tough since most of our trip will be in western Europe). I have saved around $3,500-4,000 for the trip. We will be staying at hostels, doing grocery shopping (eating in), and doing some sightseeing.

We have already booked our flights, and our Eurail pass (which was $480 for 15 travel days in 1 month). I figured Eurail is worth it for the number of cities we're visiting (but I've heard mixed reviews about Eurail, so please tell me what you think..). We were also thinking of getting flights between cities (where interrail does not go to) and using Circumvesuviana trains within Italy.

Here is what I Spent and my potential budget so far:

* Flight (one way)-$468
* Eurail pass- $480
* Hostels- approx. $800 (for the month)
* Miscellaneous flights, activities, toiletries, food -\~1200$
* Returning flight- approx. $400
* Total- $3,348 (I understand this number will be higher depending on the mistakes I make on my first trip lol)

This is my rough itinerary of the cities we want to visit with the days we plan on staying (#):

Start in Paris (2)--&gt; Marseilles (1), Barcelona(1), Madrid (2), Lisbon+Sintra(3), Naples(1), Sorrento(2), Positano(1), Santorini(2), Athens(1), Rome(2), Florence+Chianti(1), La Spezia(3), Verona(1), Milan (1), Amsterdam (2), \[Istanbul(14-going solo to visit family)\]

I understand it's a lot to visit in a month, but this is something I have always wanted to do.

My questions are:

* \-Did I save enough money for my trip? Is 4,000$ enough?
* \-Did I make a mistake with getting the Eurail pass? I have read we would have to pay extra for reservations/seats. So I am kind of second-guessing my choice of buying the pass...
* \-any advice on the best time to book hostels?
* \-any advice in general, how does my plan sound?
* \-Also if anyone has any recommendations on things to do in the cities I listed above! We love sightseeing, walking/hiking, swimming, and drinking!

Thank you in advance!!
EDIT: Thank you all for taking the time to leave a comment. We will FOR SURE be cutting this trip down to a few countries. It does feel that this trip would have been rushed, and as someone pointed out ""an itinerary from hell"" lol. With that said, thanks for everyone who left advice!",2
1292,travel,We aren’t sure if we can do this trip by ourselves or if we should get a tour guide since we are not familiar with the language or culture. What are your tips for this location? Any great guided tour programs you recommend??,2
1293,travel,"We finally bought our tickets to visit Italy for the first time for mid September but as we started planning our 12 day trip we realized the return travel to the airport is going to suck. Currently our itinerary is like this:


Day 1 (sep 14) - Arrived Rome morning (11:40AM)
Day 2 (sep 15) - Rome
Day 3 (sep 16) - Rome
Day 4 (sep 17) - Arrived Naples - Pompeii? - sleep in Positano
Day 5 (sep 18) - Positano (Amalfi coast)
Day 6 (sep 19) - Arrived Florence
Day 7 (sep 20) -  Florence
Day 8 (sep 21) - Florence
Day 9 (sep 22) - arrived Venice
Day 10 (sep 23) - Venice
Day 11 (sep 24) - arrived Rome at night
Day 12- Rome to US (10AM)

I was feeling like we were cramming a lot but it seemed doable after doing some research. We were on the fence on whether we wanted to really stay a night in Venice but we decided to do it just because it looks like a truly unique place. Positano and Amalfi coast is just a destination we have always wanted to visit so we really want to stay there. I was also wondering whether the stop and Pompeii on our way to Positano might be a tough day. Everything else is your typical Italy highlights. Any tips on improving would be great. 

My real problem is leaving from Rome. Taking a train from Venice is 4 hours and getting to Rome to sleep one night and fly at 10am feels rushed. Is there anyway to move the days around that makes it easier? Or do we just eliminate Venice altogether? I really don't want to eliminate Amalfi Coast but if I really need to I can consider it. 

We thought about flying to Rome to Venice to but the flights are early and I feel like the check in process at the airport and everything is almost like the same amount of time that I would spend in the train. 

What are your thoughts?",2
1294,travel,"I (40m) am taking my parents (70f and 74m) to Ireland in August. Our package has us spending 3 nights in Killarney and 3 in Dublin. Looking for advice. A couple notes:

* My parents are both retired teachers. A retired school librarian/teacher and a retired teacher. Dad has a Masters in Literature, but not sure he has any attachment or deep appreciation of Yeats, Joyce, or Wilde. I'm sure that they will both be in tears in the Long Hall, though, and would generally appreciate sites that show appreciation for education. It is their first time outside of America, and while they are both pretty active and healthy for their age, a three-mile walk (roughly 5km) is probably going to be the extent of their endurance in one stretch. They've never admitted as such, but I feel that choppy seas, narrow/windy mountain roads, high altitude, and suspended cable cars would be too adventurous for them - Skellig Michael, Conor Pass, and the Dursey cable car might be bridges too far. They explicitly want to see a medieval castle, take some scenic drives, and drink in a pub. Aside from that, they trust me with the itinerary so I am free to get drunk with power.
* I have been to Ireland before, and out on the west coast before. I'd feel comfortable getting us out and just about anywhere we'd like to go. We will have a rental car, a stick shift. I have driven in Ireland and Scotland before so that's not a huge deal for me driving on narrow roads in one of those cars. But you quickly get to a point-of-no-return in driving, particularly when there are scenic distractions everywhere you look like in Ireland, so I feel that Galway is about as far north as we could go while staying in Killarney, and Wicklow and Glendalough as far away as we could go while staying in Dublin.
* I know that packing an itinerary too full is a bad idea, and particularly so in Ireland that's a country best suited for meandering. I want this to be a trip that they enjoy and appreciate, not a trip where we try to take a picture at every bullet point on a ""bucket list of Ireland"" list and actually enjoy nothing.

So far, the plan that I have is as follows, and treat each bullet point as a potential day itinerary (each minor point a probability, not a certainty):

* Flight landing day
   * Flight landing day (landing at 10am local in Shannon): Cliffs of Moher, then drive to Killarney. If additional time, maybe Bunratty Castle after Cliffs of Moher, or exploring Killarney. This is going to be a really exhausting day with their first transatlantic flight (which may be more difficult because they don't travel often by plane and likely won't sleep much en route), so I thought maybe diverting to hit the Cliffs and then heading to Killarney would be just about enough.
* Staying in Killarney (two full days, then one day driving from Killarney -&gt; Dublin)
   * Ring of Kerry - want to do clockwise, but thought to cut south from Glenbeigh and through the Ballagbeama Gap and head back into Killarney through the national park - so driving through the national park on the way out and the way back. We won't be there at the time of the Puck Fair in Killorglin (will leave the day it starts, damn the luck) but thought avoiding that little corner would be a good idea in case there's extra traffic, obstructions, etc. Plus, Killarney National Park twice at different times of day/lights would be worth it. I've done the Ring of Kerry before with my wife and have a few ideas of good places to stop, but would be open to specific stops suggested by those who've been there/live there. I want to take us on the detour to Ballinskelligs so we can hit St. Finans Bay, Portmagee, and the Kerry Cliffs (my wife and I didn't get to see this).
   * Dingle Peninsula - skip Conor Pass, but hit Dingle and the Slea Head drive, stopping at Dunquin Pier, Fahan Beehive Huts or Gallarus Oratory, and Dunmore Head.
   * Cork/Kinsale, Galway/Burren, Limerick/Bunratty (or other city break). Been to all of them before with my wife. Got through the Burren and saw Poulnabrone Dolmen but felt a bit cheated that we got to Galway late in the day and only had a couple hours to explore before having to drive back. Have been through Cork/Kinsale and out to Charles Fort before.
   * Day exploring Killarney further - Muckross House, Muckross Abbey, Ross Castle, etc.
   * Drive day Killarney-Dublin (only limiting factor is getting the rental car to Dublin Airport on time)
      * Killarney through Wicklow Mountains/Glendalough - loved the scenic drive through Wicklow Mountains and a walk through Glendalough
      * Killarney through Cashel - have been to Cashel and Hore Abbey before and enjoyed thoroughly.
* Staying in Dublin (two full days, then flight day). Flight out is at 10am, so we can't count that as a tour date.
   * Self-guided walking tour through Trinity College and Temple Bar district - have to hit the Long Hall (former teachers will undoubtedly be in tears at a library so stunning). Also want to hit Marsh's Library and some of the stop-and-take-a-picture stops in the district like Molly Malone, the Famine Memorial, Ha'Penny Bridge. Wander through St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, or around Christ Church Cathedral.
   * Day trip - my wife and I had gone up to Newgrange/Bru na Boine and loved it. 
   * A day trip down to Glendalough/Wicklow would be a possibility. 
   * Day trip up to Belfast and doing the Titanic would be a possibility. 
   * Also, we could have found enough things to enjoy within Dublin close to our hotel (which is close to Trinity College) that we just stay within city limits another day.

I'm certain that I'm putting too much stock into the fact that I've been to Ireland before, and I don't mean to sound like a know-it-all. I rail about people that overpack their itineraries, and I'm sure I've done the same with mine. I loved Ireland once, I want to love Ireland again, and I want my parents to love it like I did. It was an entry point for me - my wife and I went to Ireland as our first out-of-country experience, and we've been to ten different countries since then. I want this to be an entry point for my parents as well.",2
1295,travel,"Hi all,

I am planning a 2 week trip to Morocco during Christmas and NYE and was looking for some feedback on whether this itinerary is realistic and recommendations for tours, places to go, and restaurants.

We are a family of 4 (I am 25, brother is 22, and parents are in their low 50's), and this is our first time in North Africa (closest experience to this we have done is India and the UAE) - one concern is we have rudimentary language of French so not sure if that will be a major issue:

**Interests:** definitely want to stay in riads, try the local cuisine (one of us is vegetarian), visit a hammam, and soak in the souks and medina / marketplace atmosphere. We are also all reasonably adventurous so any hiking, camel rides, or other physicial / nature related activities would be great. Being a family, nightlife is not a top priority, but would also love to attend a bellydancing show.

**Day 1: fly to Casablanca** \- (since it's the only nonstop location in Morocco from the US) the flight lands at 10 am in Casablanca so upon arrival will hire a driver and head to Essaouira right away

**Day 2-3:** **Essaouira** \- chose Essaouira due to feedback that this is a more laidback, comfortable way to ease into Morocco while we overcome jetlag; the highlights appear to be the beach, medina, and fort; none of us have surfed before but would be open to trying but wonder if December will be too cold

**Day 4-6: Marrakech** \- will hire a taxi to Marrakech (via the goats and argan tree attraction); highlights appear to be the medina, souks, Jardin Majorelle, and some of the tomb / palace ruins. Are 2 full days (plus the half day upon arrival) enough?

**Day 7-9: Sahara desert tour (also transfer from Marrakech to Fes)** \- there appear to be a myriad of tours that pick you up in Marrakech and stop by 1) Ouarzazate (Ait ben haddou looks amazing) 2) Torda Gorges and 3) Erg Chebbi dunes near Merzouga and drop you off in Fes over the course of 3 days and 2 nights. Any tour provider recommendations (willing to pay extra for a smaller group) would be highly appreciated

**Day 10-11: Fes** \- highlights appear to be the old city and tanneries, but can Fes be covered in 1 day? If so also open to using this as a base to take a day trip to Meknes

**Day 12-13: Chefchaouen** \- will hire a taxi to go to Chefchaouen - looks like there are limited highlights here outside of the blue buildings (and we've visited Jodhpur). Is there enough here to justify 2 nights or should be just overnight? Also worried on whether this place lives up to the hype or is a gimmick.

**Day 14: transportation to Tangier and fly home** \- will hire a taxi to go straight to the Tangier airport from Chefchaouen and fly home",2
1296,travel,"Hi there! I’ve had a tour rebooked multiple times to Kenya and Tanzania; I’m finally trying to go this summer.  Am hoping anyone has recently gotten a Kenyan eVisa and can help me!

1301,travel,"Hello -

Taking a trip in August/September to Belgium/the Netherlands with my SO.  I've used guides online and information shared on this, as well as the countries' subs to create this itinerary.  We won't have a car and are planning on traveling via train during our visit.  We're planning on staying in airbnbs and/or hotels.  This is both of our first times in these countries.

As far as budget, I'd say within reason.  We're planning on staying in the cities themselves and attending nice, but not overly expensive, restaurants and such.

Interests - really anything, we're completely open to what each city may offer: architecture, history, food, etc.

The preliminary itinerary is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

8/25 - 8/26: Brussels (1 day)

8/26 - 8/27: Ghent (1 day)

8/27 - 8/28: Bruges (1 day)

8/28 - 8/29: Antwerp (1 day)

8/29 - 8/30: Rotterdam (1 day)

8/30 - 8/31: The Hague (1 day)

8/31 - 9/1: Utrecht (1 day)

9/1 - 9/4: Amsterdam (3 days)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conscious of the fact that we're doing 8 cities in 10/11 days and that has the potential to be quite busy.  As usual it's a balance between the fact that we likely won't come back to these countries for a long time and want to make the most of our experience, but also don't want to be spread too thin.  My thought process here is that the train duration between each city appears to be quite short for the most part, limiting the travel duration.  Additionally, from what I've read it appears that most of these locations are best fitted for one day visits.  We're certainly open to the possibility of reducing lodging (i.e. staying in Ghent two days and doing a day trip to Bruges), but only as it makes sense.  I don't want to miss out on, for example, the nightlife of Bruges, by reducing lodging locations.  On the other hand, this would help us reduce the check in/check out/traveling with suitcases, etc.

Also, if we decide to change plans and do three days between Rotterdam, The Hague, and Leiden and wish to stay in one and day trip to the other two, which city should we stay in for the best nightlife/early morning experience?

Please provide any thoughts or comments that you have, all is welcome! Thanks.",2

1305,travel,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

Visiting Tulum and Cozumel for the first time and would appreciate any advice/tips/feedback on the rough draft of the itinerary.

&amp;#x200B;

Fly into Cancun. Rent a car. We know that you don’t need to rent a car, but it’s not that expensive; only around $100 USD for the few days we need it. We plan on going to Tulum for the first few days, so it’ll be convenient for making the initial drive down and getting around the Cenotes we want to explore. Yes, we could technically take the bus and taxis/collectivos, but how much would we really save in time and $$$. As stated, it’s only $100. We’ll spend a few days in Tulum and then we plan on driving back up to Playa Del Carmen/Cozumel and dropping off the rental car. We’ll take the ferry to Cozumel and spend a few days there as well.

&amp;#x200B;

We want to swim/snorkel a lot. From what I understand, Cozumel is a lot better than Tulum as far as snorkeling. Tulum just has the Cenotes.

&amp;#x200B;

We plan on checking out Dos Ojos in Tulum, but we’re open to other suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

For snorkeling in Cozumel we’ll probably check out El Cielo and Punta Sur. We’re kinda more interested in doing shore diving so we can kinda do our own thing, but if there’s a really cool tour that you recommend we’d be open to that to.

&amp;#x200B;

For transportation on Cozumel is it better to rent a scooter or a jeep? I couldn’t really find prices on jeeps and not exactly sure how the insurance/security deposits work.

From my research the consulate of any country knows your information including your previous visits and the results, however I wonder if it applies to different countries consulates?

I have been granted visa to a country, but due to complications from the pandemic and others I ended up travelling with an expired sevis that I didn't know about. The border patrol revoked my visa and sent me back home without barring me from entry meaning that I can re-apply for visa. I applied and got rejected so I am applying for visa to another country for another program. The form I have to fill out is asking if I have been granted/denied a visa and if I have been barred from entry to any other country before and to state the reasons why.

The only parts of the US I’ve been to before are New York and Atlanta.  Atlanta was a work trip but I had a few days to myself there and really enjoyed it. Friendly people and a good place to explore on foot.  I’ve been to NY a few times and love it there for a number of reasons such as the food, art/street art, the difference in boroughs, being able to walk for miles and having plenty to see, even if it’s just a spot of people watching. I spent 9 days there on my first trip and didn’t get bored or run out of things to do.
 
As mentioned, the things I’m interested in are food (always top of the list!), markets, music (hip-hop, funk, soul, jazz), art/street-art, comedy (not sure how common it is for people to go to a comedy club on their own?), walking round exploring, good views/nature, nice places to relax. Also 420 friendly.  I’m not really interested in museums, unless it was something cool like a hip-hop museum, or beaches (I don’t swim and get a bit bored just lying on a beach) or big tourist traps like Universal Studio’s. So I think I’ve ruled out LA after reading how much people seem to hate it there.

Two of my friends and I (we're from Slovenia) will be traveling to Mexico from April 19th to may 5th. We are curious as to what places are worth going to, what food would you recommend, and other general tips about traveling through Mexico.

&amp;nbsp;

**Our general plan** is to stay in CDMX to explore the city and surroundings for at least a few days, then travel to OAX. We are thinking about using public transport/taxis in CDMX, then renting a car to have the freedom to explore around CDMX and travel by car to OAX and use it to explore there too. We are open to making a stop or a slight detour to visit anything worthwhile seeing on the drive from CDMX to OAX too - any recommendations? Open to a possibility to go to Puerto Escondido too if it would be worthwhile for the limited time we have (16 days).

&amp;nbsp;

**Local phone number/mobile internet:** What's the cheapest way to get a Mexican mobile phone number, since using our mobile phone operators would cost a fortune while abroad? Are there any good inexpensive prepaid plans or anything similar? It would be really helpful to have a mobile internet connection and some phone calling ability if we might need to call a hotel and such.

&amp;nbsp;

**Safety:** What should we be careful about - any common scams to avoid, safety on the streets (pickpockets and such)?

&amp;nbsp;

Is **Couchsurfing** popular and recommended or should we aim for staying at **Airbnbs**? We have had excellent experience with Couchsurfing from our past travels. It's really nice to have a local host, who can recommend places to go and explore in their city but it might be a little to late to get a host now.

&amp;nbsp;

**Our interests are:**

- food and beverages - street food, cool sit-down places and restaurants (nothing too fancy though)
- nature/hiking - any nice nature spots with interesting geography/plant life, beautiful views and so on
- museums - art or other fascinating ones
- architecture - public buildings, churches, streets etc.
- markets and flea markets
- pyramids :P - we want to see at least one, maybe two or even more if there is a lot of variation, and they look equally amazing

1332,travel,"I'm traveling to Cusco this summer and have an itinerary in mind but I need help nailing down some of the details and spots! Here goes...

Day 0-1: Fly into Cusco(about 15 total hrs of traveling with a red eye). I'll arrive midday. I am trying to decide if I should stay in Cusco and just nap and walk around this evening or get transportation directly to the Sacred Valley to Acclimatize for one night. If I take this option I'm having a hard time deciding which town to stay in. The idea of seeing ruins at sunrise and sunset from the town seems very special-I'm also worried that this is going to be way too much travel in one day since the furthest out is around 1.5-2 hour transportation. Ollantaytambo, Urubamba or Pisac would be the towns I'm considering. It seems that it would be convenient to wake up already in the SV and then tour all day but I'm not sure on the logistics.

Day 2: If staying in Cusco, wake up and catch a tour of the Sacred Valley. If I stay in SV, start from the town and tour surrounding towns. I have heard it's more difficult to do this since there are not as many tour operators that originate outside of Cusco. Is Tipon worth seeing? Are the salt flats worth seeing? I've also seen there is the Sistine Chapel of Peru in the SV. What can I reasonably do in 1 day while seeing the most interesting  parts? I understand that 1 day is almost no time and that people spend weeks and months just in the Sacred Valley.

Day 3: Spend time in Cusco seeing Plaza de Armas, San Blas neighborhood, San Pedro Market, shops, Apukunaq Tianan exhibit, museums, the aqueduct and possibly walk up to Saqsaywaman. 

Day 4 - 7: Salkantay Trek 4 day 3 night. Night 3 we spend in Aguas Calientes and I believe we will have time for hot springs. Is there more than one hot spring location and do I need to buy tickets for this in advance? Day 4 arrive in MP. I am trying to decide whether or not to climb to the top on one of the hikes either via Huayna Picchu Mountain or Machu Picchu Mountain. Those that have done a trek leading up to Macchu Picchu do you have the energy for this? Later travel back to Cusco and rest.

Day 8: Considering Rainbow Mountain or the alternative Palccoyo in the morning. I've heard the 3 hour hike to Rainbow mountain has breathtaking views along the way but is also very heavily trafficked and would eat up the entire day. The alternative would have less people and a shorter hike but does it have the same type of views along the hike? Is there a better tour to do this day that is not any of the Rainbow mountains that is close enough to Cusco? Evening checking out a food &amp; pisco sour tour. Does anyone have food tour operators recommendations for a good combo of this?

Day 9: Day in Cusco - I'm not sure what to do with this day and looking for recommendations. I read about the Chinkanas and am very interested in checking these out but I don't know if they offer tours. Has anyone done this or checked out any other underground tunnels? I would be very interested in underground arch. spots or lesser known spots. I fly out of Cusco around 9 pm.

- I booked separate itineraries with JetBlue (BNA-JFK) and Singapore Airlines (JFK-FRA-SIN)
- After waiting for a long time for my bag at JFK, I found out at the service desk that JetBlue did not load the bag on the flight I was on (19/3/22, BNA-JFK), so they will send the bag to Singapore Airlines to send it to me in SIN
- JetBlue told me subsequently (23/3/22) that the bag was sent to JFK
- JetBlue said they have sent the bag (since 24 or 25/3/22) ""over to the ramp where Singapore Airlines is supposed to come pick the bag up""
- But Singapore Airlines has been telling me that they did not receive the bag (25/3/22 till today)

- WorldTracer indicates the the bag is still being traced (this has been the case since the time JetBlue said they had the bag and was sending the bag to the ramp)

It has been 10 days since I filed the baggage claim, and I am greatly affected by the inconvenience and anxious at the prospects of potentially having lost the bag.

Can anyone kindly advise, please?

My second return flight was Jan 16 which American cancelled 2/3 legs for, causing me to book last minute seats on Megabus to get home. So I had travel insurance Allianz Global Assistance for both trips. Honestly, one of the shittiest companies I’ve ever dealt with. My combined claim is $700ish. First claim is $200ish. Second is $500ish. The second claim is where I’m running into headaches.

I have provided them with my itinerary, bank statements, Covid results, screenshot of flight cancellation, and screenshots of news station talking about the snow storm during the dates in question. They are saying they require an official letter from the airline stating the reason for the flight cancellation. I have never heard of this before but whatever, I call up American Airlines and get told, they can’t imagine why an insurance company would ask for that and not just google the date to see there was a snow storm. American said they will not provide me with such letter. 

So Allianz Global Assistance has been holding up the process. They said I can move forward without it, but I have a feeling they are just going to deny the second claim outright and use that as the bs reason. Is this normal? Is Allianz Global Assistance usually as bad as I described? And are airlines supposed to provide me documentation with a stated reason for the trip cancellation?

In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**

## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?

A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm) or [Sherpa](https://apply.joinsherpa.com/travel-restrictions). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).

You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**

## ...in the US?
*Last updated Apr. 2, 2022*

All travelers, with limited exceptions (e.g. US citizens, green card holders, and their dependents), traveling to or internationally transiting via the US [need to be vaccinated, with appropriate proof](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html).

All passengers permitted to travel to *or internationally transit* the US, regardless of vaccination status, [need to produce a negative result from a viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html) (which can include an antigen test) taken the day of or day before the first flight on a single ticket to the US. Alternatively, proof of recovery, in the form of a positive test from the previous 90 days and a doctor's note certifying recovery, may be submitted instead.

The land borders are also open to vaccinated travelers (and unvaccinated US citizens and permanent residents). However, no negative test needs to be provided at land borders.

**No nationwide quarantine requirements exist.** Some individual states and/or cities may have their own recommendations, but these are just *recommendations*. **Proof of vaccination and COVID tests are not being demanded at check-in, security, boarding, or arrival for domestic travel.** Even Hawaii has removed its testing/quarantine requirements.

For more information, see the [US State Dept.'s FAQ](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/covid-19-faqs-for-travel-to-the-us-information.html) on US travel and the [CDC's Requirements for Testing/Recovery](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html).

## ...in Canada?
*Last updated Apr. 1, 2022*

**[Fully vaccinated travelers are now permitted to travel to Canada](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada), subject to standard visa requirements, without quarantine.** Unvaccinated travelers are still barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*.

Travelers who are permitted to travel to Canada despite being unvaccinated and traveling for non-essential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents. Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Unvaccinated travelers must take a pre-departure test and quarantine upon arrival.

Vaccinated travelers are no longer required to take a pre-departure test or quarantine on arrival.

All travelers, regardless of vaccination status, are required to fill out [ArriveCAN](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan.html) within 72 hours of travel. As part of this process, vaccinated travelers must upload proof of vaccination.

Fully airside international transits are permitted, regardless of vaccination status. Those traveling airside without entering Canada are not subject to testing, quarantine, or ArriveCAN requirements. For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid).

## ...in Mexico?
*Last updated Nov. 1, 2020*

At the time of writing, there are no changes to Mexico's standard entry requirements. However, the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes. Travelers must fill out a ""Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers"" to present upon arrival. There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico.

**...IN FRANCE?**

*Last updated Mar. 1, 2022*

France has categorized origin countries into either [""green"" or ""orange""](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/covid-19-international-travel).

Those traveling from countries on the green list, which includes EU countries and several countries deemed to have low levels of COVID, may travel to France for any reason regardless of vaccination status. No on-arrival test or quarantine is required. However, unvaccinated travelers must present a negative PCR test from within 72 hours of departure or a negative antigen test from within 48 hours of departure. Vaccinated travelers do not need a pre-departure test.

Those traveling from countries on the orange list may travel to France for any reason only if they are vaccinated; unvaccinated travelers need to provide a pressing reason for travel. Unvaccinated travelers must present a negative PCR test from within 72 hours of departure or a negative antigen test from within 48 hours of departure as well as potentially undergo a test on arrival. Vaccinated travelers do not need a pre-departure test and will not undergo a test on arrival. All travelers from orange countries must provide a sworn statement attesting to the absence of COVID-19 symptoms.

Note that travelers 18 years or older wishing to enter France must have received a booster dose of an RNA vaccine (e.g. Moderna, Pfizer) no later than 9 months after receiving the last mandatory dose. For all arrivals, children under 12 are exempt from COVID-19 formalities.

Germany allows unrestricted travel by *residents* of only a select few non-EU countries and territories: as of Apr. 1, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. Residents of other non-EU countries are only permitted to enter Germany if they are fully vaccinated (having received the last required does 14 days before travel, and if not traveling from an area of variant of concern), serve in an important role, or [have an urgent need for entry](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-border-control/IV-restrictions-applying-to-air-and-sea-travel-outside-of-europe/what-constitutes-an-imperative-need-for-travel.html;jsessionid=21F60EEA3ABB0D7B0249E2EBBEFA1488.1_cid295).

While Japan has loosened its entry restrictions, foreign nationals are [still not permitted to enter Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/cp/page22e_000925.html) for tourism.

Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan may be required to undergo a [quarantine of up to 7 days](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/cp/page22e_000925.html#section1) either at home or a designated facility, depending on vaccination status and origin country. All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan.

For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/index.html).

## ...in Thailand?
*Last updated Apr. 1, 2022*

As of Apr. 1, there is no longer a pre-departure testing requirement. Passengers entering Thailand must have a [Thailand Pass QR code](https://tp.consular.go.th/) or Certificate of Entry as well as health insurance with coverage of at least US$50,000.

Vaccinated travelers from any country may use the Test &amp; Go scheme. Those who register for the program via the Thailand Pass website must take a PCR test on arrival and await the results at an approved AQ/SHA+ hotel, which they must book in advance. No further quarantine is required or restrictions upon arrival is in place.

Other travelers, including unvaccinated travelers, are permitted to travel to Thailand using the Alternative Quarantine Program, but they must stay quarantined within designated hotels for 5 days at the start of their trip.

For more information, see the [Thailand Pass site](https://tp.consular.go.th/) and the FAQs linked therein.

## When will the US end its testing requirement?

There has been a significant amount of pressure from businesses in the travel industry, but there has been no date for when the requirement will be lifted. There is plenty of speculation tied to holidays or the summer season, but there is no clear evidence to suggest such a change will occur at any particular time. As a reminder, travel restrictions from Europe were only lifted last November despite speculation for half a year about imminent reopening dates.

## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?

Even though an increasing number of countries have been lifting travel restrictions, it's impossible to say when other countries (Japan is a popular country!) will follow suit. Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel. Further, there is no guarantee that countries that have flung open their doors to travelers will not shut them again at the sight of a new variant or change in the direction of the pandemic.

That being said, coming off the relatively mild effects of the omicron variant, many countries have been less reactive to recent twists in the pandemic, at least in regards to travel restrictions. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel. 

Do also take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:

* [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds)
* [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)

## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?

These questions were covered at length in the [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fjhjoz/coronavirus_megathread_for_travelrelated/). Although countries may be starting to ""reopen"", the points therein are still relevant.

1383,travel,"Hi all. Work is taking me to Poznan at the end of June and I'm thinking of staying in the country an extra 5-7 days and looking for suggestions for cities/places to stay in and things to do. 

I am super burned out and ideally want to have one home base from which day trips/activities are possible, but would ok with moving maybe once. I don't want to do a whirlwind itinerary. I'm potentially interested in either a coastal or mountain town where I could book a simple hotel and just chill the eff out enjoying the scenery for a few days, maybe with some hikes or sightseeing on half days but nothing too intense. 

I've been to Krakow and Zakopane before; saw the castle and churches and walked around in Krakow, and did a hike to Morskie Oko (although it was snowy and so foggy that you couldn't see the lake from five feet away). I wouldn't be averse to going back to either if they were conveniently located, but don't feel like I have to see them this time.

Auschwitz is on my bucket list, but not sure how convenient it would be to get to within my other desiderata.

1384,travel,"Hi,

I live in the Midwest USA. A few years ago we had a co-worker who took a Friday off, nothing out of the ordinary. She returned Monday with postcards from Dublin--she went on a weekend trip there and didn't tell anyone!

I would like to know how to pull this off, but I have no way of contacting her to get tips. I'm assuming she flew out Thursday night and arrived back in the States late Sunday to return to work on Monday.

This seems grueling, but my wife and I are really intrigued to do something like this if the opportunity presented itself. For example, we have one specific thing we'd want to see in Portugal (although we'd love to see more), and if a cheap flight presented itself we'd jump on it to be able to do so.

Has anyone done anything similar, and if so, how did you do it?

I’m trying to decide which place is the better option for me. Not only am I considering the sightseeing and relaxation experiences, but also the cost. I’m decently thrifty, so I can usually find deals anywhere, but we all know there’s a certain price that things are just going to be in tourist destinations, so any tips about which one of these destinations allows you to stretch the dollar further would be great.

I am from India, and am looking to go to France for a two month internship this summer. I would like to stay with my girlfriend who is in a student accommodation. 

However, since she's in a student accommodation, she isn't legally allowed to host me (in terms of being my host for my visa application). I am thus confused as to what to do for my proof of accommodation. 

I have considered the following options:
(a) book a student accommodation for the duration of stay (around 350 EUR)
(b) book an Airbnb (around 900 EUR), but cancel it after entering France (thus returning about 750-800 EUR)

I hope this is alright to ask here. 

As the title says, I'm looking for travel insurance company recommendations for me and my boyfriend's upcoming trip. 

Previous travel plans were unfortunately badly affected due to a certain pandemic, and we lost most of our money, so we learned our lesson and we've started looking for good travel insurance companies.

We're hoping to go from Germany to Italy for only a week at the end of April. And we're also planning more travels for later in the year to other European countries.

Plan there is leave Florence by 6am and get to Riomaggiore by 3-4pm. Bologna is planned as a day trip from Florence. Any times, but as you can probably tell we are morning people.

It's just my wife and I. Age 27 and 30. We aren't into much nightlife. We love viewpoints, history, architecture and some art. 

We also don't have any restaurants picked out except All'Antico Vinaio and La Proscuitteria Firenze. Any recommendations there for any towns would be highly appreciated also.

My wife and I are planning to go to Greece for about 4-6 weeks in June/July. We both work remotely and want to use about half of that (3-4 weeks) in one or two locations where we will be actively working. The rest of the time would be a typical holiday.

Right now we're looking at Naxos - it is big, has lots to do, connected, yet also seemingly populated enough to make functional, normal non-tourist life possible for a month. However, are there other islands that may be better? Are there places in Naxos that you'd recommend to stay besides the main city like any of the villages?

Any other tips or advice is welcome",2

Point to point between cities is looking like a $30 average if I book in advance (25 trains would be $750). Eurail seems convenient but people seem to have some complaints.

\- You still need to book tickets in advance with Eurail so it is not as flexible as it seems.

\- Many trains you need to pay for on top of your pass (once again defeating the point Eurail)

\- Many cities do not connect with Eurail

My trip is going to include Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, and Ireland. 

Any information helps!

TL:DR: Eurail is tempting because it seems easier, cheaper and more flexible than point-to-point. But it wouldn't be if you need to book in advance and still pay per train (right?).",2

This option would implies a separate flight ticket which is also cheap to get back to Rome for a total of about 5 nights in Czechia.

Secondly,  I've tried looking for monasteries to stay in for a while. I found [buddhistmonasteries.org](https://buddhistmonasteries.org), and their retreats seem like what I'm looking for. Has anyone gone with this organization? If so, how was it?

I was initially looking into staying at the Kopan monastery, but I'm new to meditation, and their courses are minimum a month long, so I don't think that would be feasible. If anyone has any suggestions on how to stay there though, I would love to hear it.

My other option would be to stay at a monastery by teaching English to monks, which is my less preferred option as I would like a retreat experience where I fully immerse into mindfulness and meditation. But, I am open to looking into this.

Thirdly, I also want to do some hikes in Nepal. Is it possible to go on hikes on the weekends if I'm staying in a monastery or would I have to do a separate trip for hiking specifically?

1495,travel,"Just got through security after having lost my ID while skiing and figured I'd share the experience.

12:30pm flight, I was told to show up early so got here at 9:30pm when TSA opened.

""Alternative ID"" I had on me:
- Ikon Pass (only thing with my name/photo
- Credit Cards
- Health Insurance Cards
- Photo of my lost ID
- (Bunch of other random cards with my name on it)

American Airlines Check In was easy. Checked a bag and all they said I needed was something with my name on it (for them). Ikon Pass worked.

TSA. Went to the front (zero lines on a mid week flight) and the woman there called her supervisor. He asked what else I had (specifically anything with a photo, asked for a Costco card). Eventually landed on him looking at:
- Ikon Pass
- 2x Credit Cards
- Boarding Pass
- Photo of my ID on my Phone (but this was almost an after thought)

He said that worked but would have to do extra screening. They swabbed and checked all my bags relatively quickly and I was through security in &lt;20min. Easy peasy. Note: This was a mid week flight at the very end of ski season. Zero line at TSA.

1539,philosophy,"**Before I begin my philosophy**, a disclaimer should be noted. I myself am Jewish and 17. I do not claim to be a philosophical genius. I also do not claim to be making a genius revelation. What I am trying to achieve is to possibly ignite a passion, as I myself have found, and to think outside traditional norms and to learn philosophy. Additionally, I want to offer up my idea as I would like constructive criticism and ideas to help further my notion or to strike it down so hard I may never recover. I essentially just want to spark some fun. I would also like to apologise for any insensitive or unintentional harmful writings in my argument; if you do find something you aren't happy with, please don't hesitate to express your concerns directly to me via direct messages. Similarly, if you would like to hear more of my thoughts, or would like to help make this argument more solid, you can always contact me at [Philosaulpher@gmail.com](mailto:Philosaulpher@gmail.com) or have a read of my blog [aphilosaulphicalassortment.wordpress.com](https://aphilosaulphicalassortment.wordpress.com/). Without further ado, I do hope you enjoy the read.

*Enjoy the read!*

**My initial/base thoughts and ideas:**

Omnipotence, by my understanding and ideas, is something that cannot be defined. With one of my issues with Descartes’ definition of it being somewhat incomprehensible, my main gripe was that it wasn’t incomprehensible enough. I hold this notion due to the idea that humans have a finite mind. Therefore we cannot comprehend infinity, e.g. we cannot count to infinity, which is the definition of ""unlimited"".

So far, I have only learnt Descartes and Swinburne's ideas regarding omnipotence. My main issues with both are that they try and define the impossible. They try to define a concept based around infinity and attributed to, what I note as a conceptual being, God who by faiths ideology is above human affairs and ideas, in which I've taken to mean that human definitions cannot define ""It"".

As a sum up of my ideas. I present to you the notion that omnipotence is an idea so unfathomable, that by trying to define it, we are thereby denouncing the very idea of it, that being that it is unfathomable for our finite minds. Therefore, if one is to seek to understand or define omnipotence, then the concept of omnipotence ceases to exist.

On a separate note, If you are confused with my theory, I believe that I have then proven my point. A human or anything with a finite mind should be confused when describing an incomprehensible being, otherwise it, by definition, is no longer incomprehensible. Furthering my research, I discovered St Augustine's via negativa quote that fits perfectly with what I've been attempting to articulate: ""If you understand, it isn't God.""

**What this could mean for other theories:**

If what I have said is to be held true, this creates a fun idea around the concept of a Christian God. As previously noted, I myself am Jewish. However, in my research it seems that Christains, as i've found, hold three main predicates attributed to God; Omnipotence, Omnibonevolence and Omniscience. All these concepts are the ""Unlimited"" of something or the idea that God knows all, even things that don't exist to us in our knowledge yet - This also works in my theory of omnipotence as to know everything isn't comprehensible for humans as we dont know what God knows that we don't know e.g. We didn't know the existence of medicine until we did know the existence of it.

In my theory I have attempted to prove that omnipotence as an attribute of God cannot be defined. For this instance, lets say I'm correct. If so, then one must hold the view that because the concept of omnipotence exists to us, then it also ceases to exist for us. This then must hold true for all the attributes given to God that depend on humans understanding infinity; Omnipotence, Omniscience and Omnibenevolence.

**Concluding thoughts:**

Ironically, whilst writing down this idea on this post, I found that my concept of omnipotence and God are, no matter what I try, always going to be an attempt at trying to comprehend God. Coincidentally, the very concept I don't agree is possible. This brings me to believe that Philosophy surrounding the concept of God is simultaneously a paradox as well. As no matter what is presented, it will always try to be a definition or an attempt to understand infinity. Therefore, I believe I am concluding, that if my philosophy is to be believed, then it is wrong and thus I end with the thrilling last idea encapsulating my beliefs and conclusions in which I undermine the entire of philosophy regarding the concept of God in these mere 4 words: Paradoxical and Ultimately Obsolete.

**Some issues that I found with my argument:**

1. As stated in the conclusion, it is hypocritical. How can I argue that one cannot define or possible comprehend the existence of God as ""it"" is a paradox? This raises the issue of me trying to comprehend the existence of God and explain it to you. Irony, huh.
2. Previously I noted that I was only 17 and new to philosophy. So again I pose the question, who am I to say these rather heavily implicated ideas and claim they are logical?
3. I don't know enough about philosophy to see the holes in my argument and try to patch them. This of course is a massive issue.

**My Rebuttal:**

1. If I were to just accept the theories and ideas that I had been presented by my teacher and not question or challenge them, then I would have such a boring time. I am a strong believer in the idea the ""To question is to think"" mindset. I find life fascinating and want to learn more about it. If people didn't question, challenge or present new ideas, we wouldn't advance as a society or as a species. Now to realate this to the issue at hand. A philosophy or an idea is simply just one's own opinion. One that can be expanded upon and one that can be challenged. If I sat here today claiming I had found the answer to the concept of God, then this criticism is valid. However, I am not claiming that. So there may be issues with hypocracy, but so do many theories regarding many a different topics. A quick example is David Hume. He presents the idea that God cannot be explained by using analogies or jumping to conclusions, he, however, puts forth this argument in a quote using an anaolgy and jumping to a conclusion. Hopefully, this has been a satisfactory answer.
2. Brandon Reece Taylorian. Otherwise known as Cometan. At age 15 he started his philosophical workings and ideology. So to the posed critique of my idea solely based on my age, I pose a question in return. Does age matter? At a certain old age in your life do you have an epiphany in which you can suddenly create ideology and formulate opinions? So why use age as a criticism?
3. This criticism I cannot answer. Hopefully, the comments can.

1722,philosophy,"Argument Against an Eternal Hell: Argument from Omniscience

Problem: It is claimed by some belief systems that God/Deity creates souls while knowing ahead of time that some of them will go to hell for all eternity.

Stance: My version of the following popular argument concludes that there is no solution to this problem, that the existence of an all-knowing higher power is incompatible with the existence of an eternal hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Argument from Omniscience:

1. God is omniscient, which means all-knowing. \[definition\]
2. According to most belief systems that contain the belief in hell, each soul is a being created by God and is therefore a fundamentally separate being from God, rather than a being that has always existed as part of God (as in various forms of Pantheism and Panentheism, for example). \[definition\]
3. Therefore, if hell exists, God has always known whether a soul will eventually go to hell, even before that soul was ever created. \[from (1) and (2)\]
4. Hell is defined as a place of extremely horrible and eternal suffering. \[definition\]
5. A soul in hell would experience extremely horrible suffering, forever and ever. \[from (4)\]
6. Since God would know ahead of time whether a person would go to hell, then every time God creates a person who would end up in hell, God is intentionally and knowingly creating a soul whose existence will be extremely horrible, forever and ever. \[from (3) and (5)\]
7. Such an act of creation would be ultimately completely and utterly pointless and meaningless. There is no point in God creating a soul whose existence would simply end up being extremely horrible, forever and ever. \[premise\]
8. An all-knowing being does not commit pointless, meaningless acts of creation. \[premise\]
9. Since God is All-Knowing, God does not commit pointless, meaningless acts of creation. \[from (1) and (8)\]
10. Therefore, souls that would end up in hell are never created. \[from (6), (7), and (9)\]
11. In conclusion, no one goes to hell. \[from (10)\]

&amp;#x200B;

Three Common Objections:

Objection 1: “There has to be a hell because souls have free will.”

Response: Even if free will exists, this does not mean that an eternal hell would have to exist. A soul getting to hell through freewill does not negate the fact that the creation of that soul would still be pointless and meaningless, since God already knew the eternal fate of that soul before that soul was created. How exactly a soul ends up in hell, whether it is due to free will or predetermination, is irrelevant. Whether a soul goes to hell by free will or predetermination has nothing to do with the fact that God already had the knowledge of that soul’s fate before that soul was created.

Objection 2: “Everyone in hell chose to be there.”

Response: Even if free will exists, it is still impossible to truly choose hell.

A) If the criteria for going to hell is lacking belief in a certain deity or faith, the person who does not this belief is not choosing disbelief, so long as that disbelief is intellectually honest. Also, it is unjust for a deity to have people go to eternal horrific punishment simply for not having the correct belief system.

B) If the criteria for going to hell is living a bad life and being a bad person, then, while it is reasonable to assume some kind of punishment or retribution or comeuppance exists after death, there is no reason this would have to be eternal. It is a logical fallacy to assume that eternal punishment is the only type of punishment that could ever exist. There are other possibilities, such as a temporary afterlife punishment, or comeuppance in a future life.

C) Even if a person claims to choose to go to hell, it is doubtful that this choice is being made with a full understanding of the consequences, and with a sound mind. An omni-benevolent (all-good) higher power would not hold people to such an ignorant decision about their eternal fate.

D) Even if a person were to actually choose hell, that still does not mean that this person would have to actually go to hell. Choosing a thing does not necessarily mean that thing happens. For example, one can choose to create a purple dragon but that does not mean a purple dragon will actually appear.

Objection 3: “If there is no hell, then Jesus died for nothing.”

Response: Whether there is a valid interpretation of Christianity that does not include the belief in the existence of hell is irrelevant to the matter at hand because the existence of an omniscient (all-knowing) higher power, which some people refer to as “God”, does not imply that Christianity is true. It does not even mean that traditional Western monotheism is true. There are many different types of theism, with many different sub-types.

1885,philosophy,"I'm currently studying sophists and I'm captivated by Gorgias' thoughts regarding existence.

Nothing exists, and even if it did, it wouldn't be knowable, and even if it were knowable, it wouldn't be communicable. Sextus Empiricus tells us that to prove that nothing exists, he poses the hypotesis that if something were to exist, it would be, not be and be and not to be altogether. Since a being cannot be and not be at the same time, both the second and the last hypotesis fall apart. So all we're left is with the being that is. 

This being that is is either eternal, generated or both altogether. If it were eternal, it would have no beginning, no cause that generated it, which means that it's infinite. But if it were infinite it would have no finite state, so spacial nor temporal definition, and by definition, something that is in no place and no time, isn't at all. Which means that if it were eternal, it would not be. 

If the being were generated, it would have a beginning, a cause of generation. But what could it be? It sure couldn't be another being, because that would imply a being before the being before the being, an eternal state, which is already proven impossible. So this hypotesis cannot be as well. And given that both theories fall aparts, the third one does subsequently. 

The conclusion is, that starting from the hypotesis that a being does exists, a being cannot exist, which is his first thesis.

As for the second thesis, the one regarding the knowability of the being, Sextus Empiricus tells us that not all that can be imagined exists, thus not all there is can be imagined as well. He says that thought and reality do not operate on the same spectrum. Meaning of it is that anyone who claims to having been granted a complete grasp of the metaphysical nature of reality is not telling the truth, because there's a waste between what one can process to imagine and what there might actually be, something that Gorgias already doesn't believe to be the case for the reasons already mentioned.

Taking it one step further, putting on a hypotetical existence and the knowability of it, he rejects the communicability of it too. What Sextus Empiricus tells us is that language and reality do not hold a perfect correspondence. Language does not have the ability to fully express reality, thus, if reality were to exist (and it does not), and even if it were to be knowable (a thing that is not as well), there is no way that it could be communicated to others. 

This brings us to agnosticism. What is the point in believing in God? And I'm not talking about the conceptual essence of God, from which many take strenght to go through their lives, but the actual deity. The supernatural being that is depicted in the bible. Not that the burden of proof relies on atheists, or that God is to be proven, since it's all about believing and having faith. Faith that is the product of a need, or a lack in one's journey. 

It's not that Gorgias is saying that you don't exist, that your sweater doesn't exist or that your shoes don't exist, he's rejecting the very metaphysical structure of reality and anyone that tries to find the intimate nature of that very reality. He denies the univocal essence that composes all there is. One can't go beyond nature to explain what it is. It goes beyond logic.

If we accept these tenets, then the bible doesn't make any sense. People actually believe in everything that is depicted in that book, and it goes against logic, because whereas one can wonder about the reasons of existence that trascend science, a book that claims to have all the answers implies that not only there is a superior truth, but that it is also known and communicated. 

There's already the thesis from italian expert in ancient hebrew, writer and translator of the bible that such bible does not talk about God, and all of his arguments are based on the fact that it's poorly translated from ancient hebrew, and that if one takes a closer look to all the words, it all kind of falls apart. It's a really interesting take and I advise you to look it up, but where I'm getting with this is that it's yet another example of how Gorgias was right about the incommunicability of the very nature of the universe. Language has barriers, not only from one to the other, but in general. 

A catholic would label Gorgias' thoughts as the purest form of sophism, using the highest rethoric to express absolute nothingness, saying that that nothing exists is silly and nonsense.

Philosophy is about posing us questions and either accepting or fighting with the ones that other philosophers pose us, and yes, it can sure look like a struggle to approach this skeptical line of thought, but then again, being raised in a catholic household, I've always struggled with God itself.

**Review of Spiderman No Way Home** 

Today I watched the brand-new Spiderman movie: Spiderman No Way Home. The basic premise of the film is that a magical spell allows the villains and the Spidermans of the previous franchises to come into the MCU. The film itself is on one level a classic superhero movie with baddies and goodies; dramatic fight scenes; and carnage in New York. However, whilst watching it I couldn’t help but ponder over the different levels the movie has, because to a certain level, yes, it is just entertainment, but on another it tries to say something more. 

The first thing I realised about the movie was the moral dilemma highlighted by doctor strange and Spiderman (influenced by aunt may). The issue is that Dr Strange and Spiderman have the ability to send back all the villains to their own universe by literally the click of a button. However, this decision is never taken. The argument for this is given by spider man, who says that by clicking the button you would knowingly kill some of the villains and that would be immoral. Dr strange argues back by saying the killing of the villains does not in any way outweigh the negative outcomes of keeping them in the MCU.

What I thought was interesting about this dilemma is how common it is in moral thinking. It is the trolley problem with a cape. If Dr Strange was in charge of the trolley he would choose to move the trolley to kill the villains as the other track holds a lot more value to him. This is the classic argument given by consequentialist philosophy. However, spiderman is not thinking in the terms of consequences but sticking to common moral maxims – in this case “never intentionally kill”. This is fundamentally a deontological or Kantian argument. 

This is really interesting to break down and understand because the rest of the film is based off this decision. For the sake of argument, it is fascinating to look at the consequences of deciding to save and (in Doc Ock’s Words) “fix” the villains. The consequences end up being that Spider man’s Aunt May dies, a huge amount of property damage occurs throughout the movie, the villains actually gain more power at some points, and (most importantly) Dr strange has to wipe the entire populations memory without their consent leaving spider man without a best friend, father figure or girlfriend. This was all done in the name of saving and fixing the villains. 

Although I do not want to pass any judgment myself or choose a philosophical side, it’s an interesting moral experiment that is taken. By the end of the film, it is almost universally accepted that Spiderman (Tom Holland) did the right thing and the decision to save them despite the damage was worth it. In true Kantian style he stuck to his duty, which was reinforced by the continued use of the idiom “with great power comes great responsibility.” Yet was it really worth it? Do all these villains you don’t know that are under the jurisdiction of another spiderman, have to be saved? I think it’s a point where consequentialism could make the argument and it maybe be accepted. But I also see the Kantian side. If he is a superhero then he must sacrifice himself, that’s literally the point of a hero, he takes that risk. Although he lost his girlfriend, best friend, and mother figure he saw that his job was to help people even if they didn’t want to be saved or were immoral themselves. 

What’s interesting about this moral decision is that I am deliberately not deciding between the two arguments because to do so would do very little. This debate has been going back and forth for millennia and even your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman can’t pull apart Kant and John Stuart Mill. Furthermore, I think your looking in the wrong place if you seek moral advice from a spiderman movie. This is especially clear when there are decisions in the movie that I personally think is just bad writing. For example, the wiping of the memory without consent fiasco is really underdeveloped and it sadly undermines what is overall an interesting movie. With this in mind I would even go as far as saying the whole inclusion of Dr Strange is flawed. What you have is essentially a God and not a superhero, which brings in a whole new area of philosophical discussion that should be left for another day.

**Roland Barthes - Elements of Semiology - Chapter II - Notes**

**II. Signifier and Signified**

**II.1. the Sign**

**II.1.1. the classification of signs**

We want to understand the meaning of the concept *sign* in the most unambiguous way possible. In order to do that, Barthes sets out to represent the *notional field* in which this word finds its place.

First, he provides us with a series of terms similar to *sign*. They all share in meaning in that they refer us to a relation between two relata (a stimulus and its response). These are the following words: signal, index, icon, symbol, allegory and sign.

The scholar then proceeds to present a comparison of these terms on five points as understood by four thinkers (Hegel, Peirce, Jung and Wallon). The five points in which the terms are compared are as follows:

(i) **mental representation** – the relation implies or does not imply the mental representation of one of the relata.

(ii) **analogy** – the relation implies or does not imply an analogy between the relata.

(iii) **immediacy** – the link between the two relata is immediate or is not.

(iv) **adequacy** – the relata exactly coincide or do not.

(v) **existential aspect** – the relation implies, or does not imply an existential connection with the user.

In this little exercise, Barthes showcases the economy of language (see ch.I.1.2), i.e. how a word carries a meaning (or value) not just in itself but also in relation to the words around it. At a certain level, we all have a notion of what *sign* means. It is, however, when we compare it and contrast it with terms similar to it that we can start fleshing out a more exact definition, gain a more precise understanding of what *sign* means.

**II.1.2. the linguistic sign**

*Sign* as understood within the context of linguistic theory is the compound of a signifier and a signified.

new linguistic term → Martinet introduces **the double articulation principle** as the criterion which defines language. It helps us map out the two-level structure of a language and distinguish between (i) *the primary articulation* in which we look at language in terms of its *significant units*, i.e. meaningful elements such as words or monemes and (ii) *the secondary articulation* where we concern ourselves with language as a sum of *distinctive units*, i.e. distinct, yet meaningless sounds or phonemes which come together to form meaningful elements (*e.g. two words such as* *“dog” and “god” may contain the same distinctive units but this is arbitrary and bears nothing to the meaning of these words*)

To illustrate the two levels of articulation in relation to one another, Barthes provides us with the example of American Spanish and how it produces over 100,000 significant units out of 21 distinctive units.

**II.1.3. form and substance**

Now that we have defined the linguistic *sign* as the union of signifier and signified, Barthes refers us to the plane of the signifier or *plane of expression* and the plane of the signified or *plane of content.*

new linguistic terms → When Barthes talks about the **plane of content** he is referring to the purely semantic (meaning-carrying) elements contained in language, while with **plane of expression** he means the formal units of language as taken by themselves.

The scholar follows up by referring us to Hjemslev‘ concept of two strata which make up each of the two planes: (i) *form* and *(ii) substance.* In his own words, Barthes describes as ***form*** “what can be described exhaustively, simply and coherently without resorting to any premise outside the spectrum of linguistic theory” and ***substance*** as the entire set of linguistic phenomena which rely on premises outside linguistic theory.

We, thus, distinguish two pairs of strata (form, substance – form, substance), each comprising one of the two planes (of signifier/expression, of signified/content) which in turn come together to form the *sign.* Let us follow up by looking at the four strata:

**(i) a substance of expression:** the substance with which we express language, the field of phonetics.

**(ii) a form of expression:** the form in which we express language, paradigmatic and syntactic rules. (see Ch. I.1.6)

**(iii) a substance of content:** the “positive” meaning of a signified, i.e. “the emotional, ideological, notional aspects of the signified” as Barthes describes.

**(iv) a form of content:** the ways several signifieds may organise themselves into meaningful wholes.

**II.1.4. the semiological sign**

Extrapolated from the linguistic sign, the semiological sign is equally formed by a signified and a signifier. A distinction, however, we make at the level of substance. Across many semiological systems (objects, gestures, images) the substance of expression is primarily there to fulfil a functional, utilitarian use and only secondarily comes to signify something.

To illustrate, we eat food, first and foremost, to nourish ourselves and we wear clothes to protect ourselves. Yet, our choice of food or clothing during a traditional celebration like Christmas for example clearly demonstrates that food and clothes also carry value as signs.

Barthes proposes calling semiological signs with an originally functional use “**sign-functions**”. He describes the process in which functions come to be signs of themselves as the “double” or “twofold movement”.

appended concept → The **twofold movement**: (i) First, as a function is adopted for general use it enters the collective mind of a culture. During this process, the people who use it pervade it with meaning and convert it into a sign of itself. (ii) Once the sign of a function is constituted, people perceive the function itself (an object, a gesture, a picture) as carrying the connotations of its sign.

e.g In the first part of the movement, construction-site workers adopt and use hard hats to protect their heads from different types of hazards. In the second part of the movement, we readily associate hard hats with construction sites and workers therein. To give an example, there exists in the U.S. a non-profit organization called “Helmets to Hard hats” which “helps war veterans secure a career in the construction industry”.

The constitution of a new **sign-function** (e.g. “war helmet” , “hard hat”) is located at the point in which we take a thing we perceive with our senses and start to think we understand what it is, i.e. we make it intelligible to us. At this precise moment, what we apprehend in our mind is not the sensual thing itself but an idea of it, an idea filled with connotations which place the new sign in constellation with other existing signs in a play of associations and dissociations.

Barthes‘ insight here provides us with grounding enough to grasp the process in which we constitute, even create the reality we experience whilst under the impression that we are learning about it, understanding it.",3

1967,philosophy,"The liar index or scheme are, ""This sentence is false/not true,"" or, ""L: L is false/not true."" (I appreciate the subtle difference between ""false"" and ""not true,"" here. In fact, falsity is better styled as antitruth rather than just the absence of truth. Plenty of things are not true without being false, i.e. everything that is not truth-apt in the first place. Nevertheless, in propositional space, a sentence not being true collapses into a sentence being antitrue; this is a peculiarity of logical syntax.) Likewise, the honest index or scheme are, ""This sentence is true,"" or, ""H: H is true."" Notoriously, L generates a paradox whereas H doesn't, though considerations about the kind of meaning L can have reflect on the kind of meaning H can have, too. For example, if one held to the idea that L is meaningless (not just because it is paradoxical, however), one would have reason to hold that H is meaningless, too. (I don't hold that L is meaningless, either partwise or as a whole; I appreciate the relevant consequences of the local revenge sentence, ""This sentence is false or meaningless."")

Now, the [knower paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-paradoxes/#KnoPar) is comparable to the liar paradox: ""This sentence is known to be false,"" if true, is provable, and if provable is known, yet... Or, if false, is provably true, etc. The technical intricacy of the actual Gödel sentence is irreducible to, ""This sentence is unprovable,"" but that index does count as a decent introductory linguistic ""naturalization"" of the Gödel sentence. If you think that [understanding is not a subconcept of knowledge but on the same ""level,""](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/understanding/) you might consider, too, ""This sentence is not understood."" Let's refer to all such sentences, even their positive counterparts (H-like counterparts of these), as Ж-sentences.

So the first thing I ""noticed"" is that the Ж-indexes, due to their indexicality, don't seem possible to infer in a non-deviant way from any other premises. Granted the principle of logical explosions, it *would* be possible to infer, ""This sentence is false,"" from, ""*A* &amp; *\~A*,"" but this is for syntactic, not semantic, reasons.  ""This sentence is true and this sentence is false; therefore (by conjunction elimination), this sentence is false,"" works a little better, but even so, the Ж-conclusions involved are trivially presupposed anyway. I also tried out:

1. The conclusion of this argument is true or false.
2. The conclusion of this argument is not true.
3. Therefore, the conclusion of this argument is false.

But that's the best I've come up with for showing that there are such things as inferrable Ж-sentences.

So all that being said, this gives us a good way to introduce the next Ж-sentence I want to consider, viz., ""This sentence is not an axiom."" Suppose that the minimum characterization of axioms is ""non-inferred sentences"" (or ""only amenable to being trivially inferred according to the logical schematics of *A* → *A*""). Now if Ж-indexes are never nontrivially inferred, however (due to their indexical closure, so to say), then they can only be introduced as axioms. So, ""This sentence is not an axiom,"" would have to be an axiom, and therefore false. But then if used as an axiom, this Ж-index would have to be ""held true,"" at least hypothetically, so that other things could be inferred truly from it. Yet nothing can be nontrivially inferred, directly, here. Maybe my derivation is off, but it seems to me, then, that, ""This sentence is not an axiom,"" is paradoxical; not as strongly paradoxical as the original example of L, but closer in mysterian degree to the negative knowledge-theoretic Ж-sentence.†

The last Ж-sentence I want to go over is, ""This sentence ought to be true."" Forget asking whether it is already indeed true or false (or both or neither or whatever). Instead, suppose that ""ought"" implies ""can."" How would we frame this implication in this case? ""If this sentence ought to be true, then this sentence can be true,"" looks like a plausible enough start, but note that the various uses of ""this"" in the original Ж-sentence and then in the conditional, result in that same kind of indexical closure mentioned above, such that it is unclear how the ""can be true"" of the hypothetical index is the ""can be true"" we want for the categorical sentence. (The whole conditional sentence is the one that ""can be true"" in terms of the conditional, not the original Ж-sentence.)

Second shot: say with R. M. Hare or J. L. Mackie that there is something ""inherently prescriptive"" about ought-language. In other words, every assertoric ought corresponds to a prescription. But to what prescription does, ""This sentence ought to be true,"" correspond? ""Make this sentence true""? Yet that imperative, as self-referring still, is, as an imperative, not truth-apt.†† ""Make, 'This sentence ought to be true,' true""? Now this is where things get even ""weirder,"" though. Again, if ""ought"" implies ""can,"" and not just any old ""can"" but specifically agent-grounded potentiality, we are supposing the power to make, or not make, the deontic Ж-sentence true. This power can be cashed out as the power to add a truth-value to a sentence independently lacking one, or changing the truth-value the sentence already has. Suppose we made the deontic Ж-sentence false. However, its being true in the first place was the only thing that would have grounded the possibility of its being made false. It seems, then, that if we make it false, we contradict the possibility of making it false. So instead suppose that we make the sentence true (or ""keep"" it true). In one sense, we have fulfilled the duty mapped by the sentence. Yet the act that fulfills this duty, seems to go on to reestablish the very same thing, so that making it true does not actually conclusively discharge the duty in question, but we must go on to remake its truth over and over again, to satisfy the ""ought"" at play.

So the deontic Ж-index seems paradoxical *even in its positive format.* (I imagine that, ""This sentence ought to be false,"" would be paradoxical, too, even if in subtly different ways, though I haven't really analyzed the issue.)

I have been obsessed with the liar paradox for about eleven years (since 2010, when I first used the idea (see the first footnote) of erotetic counterparts to construct an attempted solution to the paradox). On the one hand, I'd love to come up with a compelling solution to the original problem; but if the best I can do is just invent new enigmas, well, I'll ""take it."" If philosophy is more about questions than answers anyway, then if I'm as obsessed with philosophy in general as the liar paradox in particular, then...

†^(Sidebar: I have not analyzed, ""This sentence) *^(is)* ^(an axiom,"" more or less at all, except modulo the question, ""Is this sentence an axiom?"" which has a correct answer, ""No, because questions are not the kind of sentences that can be axioms."" Say that, ""Ж?"" is the) *^(erotetic counterpart)* ^(of a) ^(Ж-sentence. ""Is this sentence true?"" and, ""Is this sentence known to be true?"" for example, are the erotetic counterparts of H) *^(simpliciter)* ^(and then knowledge-theoretic H. Neither admits of a possibly correct affirmative answer. It is less clear to me that, ""Is this sentence understood?"" has no positively-answerable erotetic counterpart. The difference seems to lie in an) [^(epistemic operator being factive)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-epistemic/#EpisPrinEpisLogi) ^(whereas an understanding operator is not. At any rate, for an) ^(Ж-sentence to admit of only negatively resolvable erotetic counterparts seems to be an important potential ingredient in a recipe for resolving the attendant paradoxes, though how exactly this should be so I haven't worked out all the details of yet.)

††^(In the presentation of logical arguments, one often introduces the premises (relative axioms)) ^(by way of imperatives such as, ""Let it be true that..."" or, ""Assume that..."" or, ""Suppose that..."" Note that one can never introduce a Ж-sentence in the same way as one might introduce other sentences: ""Assume that this sentence is true,"" is transyntactically incorrect, seeing as, again, imperatives are not truth-apt as such. The only thing to be done is to say, ""Assume that, 'This sentence is true,' is true,"" which traps H inside of abstract quotation marks, and indicates again the indexical-logical quarantine in which) ^(Ж-sentences are to be placed.)",3

**I. Language and Speech**

**I.1. In Linguistics**

**I.1.1 In Saussure:**

Barthes introduces Saussure’s concept of the *language/speech* dichotomy.

*Language(langue)* is first defined as (i) a purely social object, (ii) a systematised set of conventions necessary to communication.

*Speech(parole)* is first defined as (i) the material of the signals which compose language, (ii) the form the application of the rules (which constitute language) takes.

**I.1.2 The language (langue)**

*Language(langue)* is further defined as both (i) a social institution and (ii) a system of values.

(i) social institution: Barthes describes langue as a “collective contract one must fully accept in order to communicate” or “a game with rules one must learn to be able to play it”.

(ii) system of values: The elements which make up langue each carry a certain value in themselves as signs and at the same time a value in relation and constellation to one another as they come together to form langue.

**I.1.3 Speech (parole)**

*Speech(parole)* is further defined as (i) “an individual act of selection and actualization”.

(i) individual act of selection and actualization: The speaking subject combines the elements of the language system to produce speech. The speech the speaking subject produces constitutes a personal thought the sp.su. wished to communicate. In this way, the speech act is not purely creative but combinative.

**I.1.4 The dialectics of language and speech**

There is no *language* without *speech* and no *speech* outside *language*. It is a relation of reciprocal comprehensiveness and we can only fully perceive and define the one in light of the other. Linguistics exists in the exchange between the two.

*Language* is at the same time the product and the instrument of speech: (i) Historically, it is speech which makes language evolve, i.e. speech phenomena precede language phenomena. (ii) Genetically, babies acquire language by being exposed to a speech rich environment not by reading grammar books.

**I.1.5 In Hjemslev**

Hjemslev provides a different way to structure language. He distinguishes three planes. The three planes I compare with platonic planes of existence:

(i) the schema: language as a pure form – language as abstract idea/form (e.g. the idea of tree, the philosopher)

(ii) the norm: language as material form – language as an „icon“ (e.g. a tree, Socrates as philosopher)

(ii) the usage: language as a set of habits – language as a „simulacrum“ (e.g. the painting of a tree, a sophist)

Barthes brings Saussure‘s and Hjemslev‘s ideas together to derive schema/usage as an alternative articulation of language/speech. Schema/usage, Barthes adds, better enables us to perceive language as a formal institution and speech as an evergrowing corpus of social events.

**I.1.6 Some problems**

new linguistic term → **syntagm**: a combination of signifiers which derives its meaning as a whole based on the position each signifier occupies. (e.g. „Anna ate a hamburger“ has a different meaning from „a Hamburger ate Anna“)

new linguistic term → **paradigm**: a category of signifiers which can substitute one another to change the meaning of a sentence. (e.g. in „Anna ate a hamburger“ we can replace „Anna“ with „John“, „ate“ with „ran“ and „hamburger“ with „marathon“)

Barthes poses three problems that we have to take up once we adopt the views of Saussure, Hjemslev and similar thinkers:

(i) Problem A – Is it possible to identify the language/speech relationship with the more straightforward code/message? This is a tricky subject because the conventions of a code are explicit and of a language implicit. Nevertheless, particular thinkers do just that.

(ii) Problem B – How do we categorise fixed syntagms (e.g. magnanimus) in light of normal syntagmatic relations between signifiers in speech? In what way?

(iii) Problem C – Do we simply admit the existence of meaningless signifiers? (e.g. letters not pronounced in speech) Furthermore, how do we take into account the multiplicity of signification in a single signifier?

**I.1.7 The idiolect**

appended concept → **idiolect:** The language inasmuch as it is spoken by a single individual. The whole set of linguistic habits of a single individual at a given moment. (examples for the idiolect are (i) the language of an aphasic or (ii) the style of a writer)

**I.1.8 Duplex Structures**

appended concept → **duplex structures:** Provided we admit the relation of *language/speech* as that of code/message, then we can distinguish between four possible cases of duplex structures:

(A) Two cases of circularity – (i) (M/M) e.g. reported speech and all indirect styles in general, (ii) (C/C) e.g. proper names.

(B) Two cases of overlapping – (i) (M/C) e.g. cases of autonymy, circumlocutions, synonyms where the message overlaps the code, (ii) (C/M) e.g. shifters, pronouns like „I“ and „you“ which have a circumstantial meaning according to who uttered them.

**I.2. Semiological prospects**

**I.2.1 The language, speech and the social sciences**

Barthes explores different ways in which we can capture the *language/speech* dialectic e.g. as system/process or structure/event. In this way, he widens the definition of language/speech to encompass all systems of signs, even where the substance of communication is not verbal.

appended concept → Merleau-Ponty‘s distinction between spoken speech as the acquired wealth of a language and speaking speech as a signifying intention in its nascent state.

**I.2.2 The garment system**

intro→ From the get go, we understand that analysing hypothetical systems of objects, images or behaviour patterns is not as straightforward as simply applying the linguistic notion of language/speech as-is to them. Instead, as we move from linguistics to the broader scope of semiology, we have to investigate each system of signs separately and admit to specific modifications where applicable.

The garment system→ In order to better navigate the garment system we have to subdivide it into three further systems, according to which substance is used for communication. Please note that when it comes to the first two of the three systems, they are not derived from a „speaking mass“ but from a centralised group of experts and decision-makers in the fashion industry.

Here follow the three subsystems of communication:

(i) In clothes as written about: The fashion clothes themselves, as written about, function as a code. They are language in the level of vestimentary communication. The actual writing, i.e. the written message functions as the speech and is taken from and delivered in the form of verbal communication.

(ii) In clothes as photographed: The photographed models wearing the clothes all count and function as one human canvas. The generic appearance of these models as normative individuals, i.e. their body types, camera expressions, way of wearing clothes constitutes and represents the fixed, top-down speech of the fashion industry to the public. The language in the photograph is delivered in the abstract form of the clothes the model is wearing.

(iii) In clothes as worn: We are back in the real world. The language of the garment system is made (a) by the oppositions of pieces, parts of garment and details, i.e. variation potentials, (b) by the rules which govern the association of the garment pieces among themselves. The speech manifests itself in the form each individual chooses to wear their clothes e.g. size of garment, degree of cleanliness or wear, personal quirks, the free association of pieces. Barthes, following the language/speech model terms this the costume/clothing dialectical relationship. Still, he reminds us that in the case of clothes the costume part comes to us in a top-down form, i.e. not from the „people“ but from a panel, an „authority“.

**I.2.3 The food system**

The food system→ The food system allows for a near seamless adaptation of the language/speech distinction. A restaurant menu functions as a great illustration of how language relates to speech in alimentary communication. The way a menu is put together is the language. It is derived from a structure both cultural(national or regional) and social, i.e. a structure formed by the sedimentation of a people‘s culinary choices across time. The content of this structure, i.e. the variation of individual items of food and drink which populate the structure according to the day and customers functions as the speech.

**I.2.4 The car system, the furniture system**

Much like the garment system, in both the car and furniture systems the language originates from centralised groups of experts and decision-makers in each respective industry. Both systems can be compared to the garment subsystem of „clothes as worn“.

The car system→ (i) In cars as objects: Where the language in the car system is made up by the sets of forms and details that make up each car prototype, the scope of speech is always very narrow because of the general lack of customisation choices the individual buyer has.

(ii) In cars as driven: The plane of speech is more pronounced in the driving of a car. There, the individual driver is afforded the freedom to act on, combine and in this way put the different parts of the car to use. Car usage across time by multitudes of drivers issues its own forms which in turn come to constitute a language.

The furniture system→ Language here is constituted by the oppositions of functionally identical pieces e.g. two different styles (farmhouse vs modern) of dining table. Each style carries a different meaning and a separate value with regards to the rules of association of the different units at the level of the room. The user has speech in so far as he can (i) tinker with individual pieces of furniture and (ii) freely associate separate pieces of furniture together.

**I.2.5 Complex systems**

Barthes introduces complex systems such as cinema, television, advertising. These are systems where multiple substances of communication (images, sounds, written words e.t.c) are engaged simultaneously and in this way form subsidiary languages within greater systems of signs. He notes the difficulty that languages such as those of image or music have not been as thoroughly analysed as the linguistic one.

Furthermore, Barthes brings up the press, another complex system, in order to make a case for connotation as the development of second order meanings, a language within the language with its own speech-phenomena, idiolects and duplex-structures.

Barthes finally notes that in the cases of complex systems it is not possible to predetermine what belongs to language and what to speech.

**I.2.6 Problems (I) – the origin of the various signifying systems**

intro→ In this part of the chapter, Barthes deals with two problems which stem from the semiological extension of the notion language/speech.

The first problem→ In the linguistic model language/speech we understand that nothing enters language without having been tried in speech and conversely that no speech (in as much as it constitutes communication) is possible where the speaker does not draw from the body of language.

In most other semiological systems (e.g. garments, cars, furniture), however, the language is not elaborated through the accumulation of speech acts across people and time but by a deciding group, e.g. a technocracy. The end-users (e.g. consumers) may follow these languages and draw messages from them but have no part in the elaboration of these languages.

Regardless of the actual origin („a technocracy“ as opposed to „the people“) of the system (latent content) and its usage (manifest content), we have to make space in our minds for the plane which affords both a language and its speech to spring forth and exist in dialectical interplay. This we may choose to call ideology or even Zeitgeist, i.e. spirit of the time.

**I.2.7 Problems (II) – the proportion between “language” and “speech” in the various systems**

The second problem→ In linguistics we observe a great disproportion between language as a finite set of rules and speech as an infinite amount of possible combinations. In particular semiological systems (e.g. clothes as written about, cars, furniture), the scope of possible combinations is limited, small and possibilities for speech range from poor to non-existent within that system of signs itself.

This leads Barthes to propose that in (non-linguistic) semiological systems there exist not two but three planes: (i) matter, (ii) language, (iii) usage. Barthes adds that if in such systems, the language needs a matter and no longer speech, it is because unlike that of human language their origin is utilitarian, not signifying.",3

**A prologue – clarification, explanation, recapitulation**

As we set out on this philosophical treasure hunt, the X on our map is always the first philosophy, i.e. the highest and most authoritative of sciences. It is the science which investigates the first principles and causes. In other words, we long and pursue to find out not only the how but also the why of the universe, sophia itself. Our thoughts are raised high and a rare excitement stirs our spirit and mind. Yet, the road is long. It is easy to miss the forest for the trees, or in this case to focus on particular words of Aristotle and miss his contemplations, the texts he passed on to us.

Therefore, whenever Aristotle mentions, and I paraphrase, *“our investigation”*, *“system of study”* or *“the science we are seeking”* which he then describes as *“the most fundamental”* or *“prior”* or *“authoritative”* or with some similar qualification, he is referring to the first philosophy.

In turn, with the first philosophy, we mean the pursuit of sophia. Sophia we tentatively interpret as the highest level of knowledge, i.e. the knowledge of the first principles and causes. In other words, the why and the how of the universe, of existence itself.

Now, when we use the word science, we mean episteme and define it as a principled system of studying and understanding a particular kind of knowledge.

The word aporia(pl. aporiai) we understand as a challenging question or puzzle that can be answered or solved through the dialectic.

Aristotle‘s four causes (aitiai) which he brings up very often, we agree to understand more as explanations. We find them below:

1. the material cause - What something is made of – e.g. this table is made of wood
2. the efficient cause – How it came to existence – e.g. the carpenter made it
3. the formal cause – The structure of its form and becoming – e.g. the table design blueprint
4. the final cause – The function it fulfils – e.g. it‘s a dining table

**Chapter 1 – the Path of the 15 Knots**

 (a) General Introduction Aristotle writes Book Β of the Metaphysics in the form of a mental map, wherein he strives to clearly define and delimit the path we must take to find the knowledge we seek, i.e. sophia. This path he carves out in the form of a number of hurdles that we must overcome or more specifically 15 aporiai which we must (i) now deeply understand in order to (ii) seek to solve later. We note that Aristotle offers no solutions in this book. He tries, instead, to articulate these 15 aporiai in the most coherent and comprehensive way possible.

(b) What is an aporia? Aporia is a word central to this book. We cannot afford to settle for a general definition. Instead, we set out to identify and keep as close to Aristotle‘s meaning of the word. The philosopher illustrates this with a metaphor. He gives aporia the form of a knot that keeps thinkers tied down and unable to move forward. A knot that may be complex but not unsolvable. In order to loosen and untie this knot, we must first survey its form, seek to deeply understand how it is tied together. In this way, Aristotle points us towards the 15 aporia knots which he plans to elaborate on in the following chapters.

**A presentation of the 15 Aporiai**

From here on and for the rest of book Β, Aristotle deals with the 15 aporiai in detail. He presents each aporia following a format specific to the dialectic: (i) first, he poses the problem, i.e. he asks the question. (ii) He follows up with a thesis, a first statement that remains to be proven correct. (iii) He then proposes an antithesis, i.e. he offers a second statement as a challenge to the first.

Does Aristotle mean to keep the aporiai of what he calls “the first philosophy” for the eyes of “dialecticians” only? No. The philosopher meticulously follows this exact format in order to enable us, his readers, to form our own opinions and come to our conclusions.

**Chapter 2 – Aporiai 1 to 5**

**Aporia 1**

**(problem)** Does the investigation of the first causes and principles belong to one science or more than one?

**(thesis)** How can all principles belong to the domain of one science if they share no relation with one another, whether it be relations (i) of opposition *e.g. thesis and antithesis,* or (ii) of relevance *e.g. we cannot find the principles of motion or finality in things unchangeable*?

**(antithesis)** Whereas it does appear appropriate for the principles to be investigated across a number of sciences which one would we deem the one we seek, the most “architectonic” and prior, i.e. the first philosophy?

**Aporia 2**

**(problem)** is it the domain of one science to investigate both the principles of substance and those of logic?

clarification → with principles of logic we refer to axioms such as (i) the law of identity A=A, i.e. A is equal to itself, or (ii) the law of non-contradiction (if A=B then A≠ not B), i.e. A cannot be equal and not equal to B at the same time.

clarification → with principles of substance we mean the underlying substance or substratum from which all things are made of and which we can find in everything e.g. fire for Heraclitus or water for Thales.

**(thesis)** We already apply the principles of logic across many sciences such as geometry or astronomy and cannot therefore claim them as exclusive to one science. In fact, we can easily claim that logic belongs to its own system of study, i.e. science.

**(antithesis)** Having acknowledged that the investigation of logic principles is separate to that of substance, which of the two investigations do we accept as the prior and most fundamental?

**Aporia 3**

**(problem)** Do all substances fall under one science or under more than one?

**(thesis)** Should we happen to distinguish a number of sciences as dealing with substances, then which one of them do we consider the most authoritative?

**(antithesis)** How can we make sense of a single science dealing with all substances when we perceive some substances as sense-perceptible and others as suprasensible?

**Aporia 4**

**(problem)** Does our investigation deal with substances alone or with their attributes as well?

**(thesis)** If we are investigating both substances and the attributes of substances, then our system of study must be demonstrative in nature. However, as we believe, the science of substance cannot be a demonstrative one.

**(antithesis)** If we leave the study of the attributes of substance to another science then which science would that be and what priority would we give it?

**Aporia 5**

**(problem)** Do only sense-perceptible substances exist or are there others beside them such as Platonic forms or Pythagorean mathematical entities? If there are, are these of one kind or more than one?

**(thesis)** The Platonic treating of forms as immanent and imperishable &amp; mathematical entities as intermediate to the forms and the perishable, sense-perceptible world poses several problems and paradoxes. (Aristotle elaborates on this in book Α Ch. 9)

**(antithesis)** When we study geometry or mathematics, we may say that e.g. the circle we drew on the blackboard refers to the abstract form circle and that the π equation we wrote next to it refers to an abstract mathematical entity. To claim, however, that these abstracts are imperishable, yet occupy the same space as their perishable counterparts? Once again, this creates many logical difficulties and pushes to the paradoxical.

**Chapter 3 – Aporiai 6 &amp; 7**

**Aporia 6**

**(problem)** Do we understand the principles and elements of things as (i) the classes or genera under which they fall or (ii) the parts of which they are composed?

**(thesis)** We already know of several arts and sciences where the principles are treated as the primary constituent parts: (i) One is phonetics, where the principles and elements of words are the individual sounds which make them up. (ii) Another is geometry, where basic geometrical proofs are implied in more advanced ones (Euclid calls basic math. proofs “elements”). (iii) Furthermore, Empedocles calls fire, water and so on as the constituent elements of things. In a nutshell, we have plenty of examples where we count principles as composite parts.

**(antithesis)** We can also make a case for viewing the genera as the principles of things provided that knowledge of the genera of something provides us with (i) its definition, (ii) a framework of knowledge on it, (iii) its point of origination. Let us note, however, that the principles cannot be both the constituent parts and the genera at the same time.

**Aporia 7**

**(problem)** Supposing we understand the genera as the principles, do we limit our study to only the most abstract and primary genera or do we focus instead on the more concrete, yet ultimate ones? To illustrate, do we regard “insect” as a principle or do we think more in terms of “monarch butterfly” and “hercules beetle”?

**(thesis)** If we consider the primary genera as principles, then we will have to admit *being* and *unity* as the highest principles and substances of the universe. How can we go about this, though, when we distinguish each subordinate class by its marked differences from all the rest? We would then have to consider each subordinate class as a further principle to the point of absurdity.

**(antithesis)** If we consider the ultimate genera as principles, we will not be able to pose principles as separate of the individual things of which they form the substance. A principle, however, is by definition a substance prior and external to the things it makes up.

**Chapter 4 – Aporiai 8 to 11**

**Aporia 8**

**(problem)** We know and make sense of things only in so far as they carry some identity or unity or share some attribute universally. Yet, if this is a necessary precondition for the existence of knowledge, then we admit the existence of something outside and above particular things which allows us to ponder them, systematise and order them, i.e. genera.

These are objects of thought, things we can contemplate in our mind. In the absence of thought-objects, however, we have nothing more than a sea of infinite sense-perceptible particulars. How can we then gain knowledge of them or systematise this knowledge into a science?

**(thesis)** If there was nothing apart from an infinity of material things, then (i) we would have no capacity to gain knowledge of something, only to perceive it with our senses. Furthermore, (ii) there would be nothing eternal, nothing unchanging for, as we know, material things are always in a process of coming-to-be and always perish.

If there is nothing eternal, then how can this continuous process of coming-to-be exist? There ought to be something suprasensible and imperishable which pervades sense-perceptible, perishable things and gives them their form across the different stages of their coming-to-be like a form or schema. (e.g. the journey from acorn to great oak tree)

**(antithesis)** If we suppose that these eternal, unchanging thought-objects or forms exist, how do they work?

(i) What criteria do we follow to know in which cases they do exist and which not? *e.g. is there a form for Socrates which pervades all people called Socrates or is there instead just the form man e.t.c*

(ii) How do the finite and eternal thought-objects constitute the substance of the infinite material objects?

**Aporia 9**

**(problem)** Do principles have formal or numerical unity?

clarification → Formal unity refers to the unity of the form which several particular things may share. To illustrate, a butterfly and a beetle are both insects, i.e. they are of one kind. When we talk of numerical unity, we consider individual things only in terms of their number. To continue the illustration, a particular butterfly and beetle may be of one kind, yet they are two in number.

**(thesis)** If we claim that principles only have formal unity, then we also deny the many sense-perceptible particulars their numerical unity, i.e. that they are many in number.

**(antithesis)** Supposing, on the other hand, that principles are limited to numerical unity, we then have to acknowledge the absurdity that every particular sense-perceptible thing comes with its own individual principle. To illustrate, it is as though we lose the capacity to acknowledge that H2O and CO2 both have oxygen(O) in them.

**Aporia 10**

**(problem)** Do perishable and imperishable things proceed both from the same principles or from separate ones?

**(thesis)** If all things proceed from the same principles, then (i) how can some be perishable while others imperishable and (ii) why?

Aristotle contends that his forerunners have not treated this question sufficiently in spite of its deserved gravity.

(i) Hesiod the mythologist, the philosopher mentions, pointed to nectar and ambrosia as the means to immortality. Yet, if the gods require these to remain in existence, then how can they be considered immortal?

(ii) Empedocles, who Aristotle considers a forerunner, treats of things as separated by *“strife”.* In doing so he produces a paradox, however, where *“strife”*, the nominal cause of destruction and separation, becomes also the cause of all creation. At the same time, Empedocles regards *“love”* as causing creation. Yet, when *“love”* brings things together and subsumes them into something new it destroys them instead.

**(antithesis)** If perishable things proceed from perishable principles specific to them, then (i) how are these perishable principles born in the first place and (ii) do they not have to resolve into other principles when they perish? If so, they are not to be counted among the first principles we are looking for in the first place.

**Aporia 11**

**(problem)** Do *unity (the One)* and *being* exist in themselves as the first principles which comprise the substance of all things *(position of the Platonists and Pythagoreans)* or are they instead composed of an underlying substance prior to them? *(As the Ionian physicists suggest)*

**(thesis)** If we refuse to consider *being* and *unity* as substances which exist in themselves and are separate of individual particulars, then we can no longer acknowledge numbers nor any other universal as existing in themselves, separate of individual particulars either.

**(antithesis)** In the case we do consider that *being* and *unity* exist apart from and prior to all other things, then not only do we have to recognise them as substances in themselves but also have to accept that they pervade all other things to the degree that we can only admit *being* and *unity* as having a true and positive existence. In other words, should we follow this argument to its rational conclusion, we end up denying the many particulars and adopting a monist worldview as expressed by Parmenides: *“All things that are are one and this is being”*.

**Chapter 5 – Aporia 12**

**Aporia 12**

**(problem)** Are numbers, bodies, planes, points, substances or not?

**(thesis)** Among philosophers, the Ionian physicists especially counted the first principles and elements of being among material bodies such as those of water, fire, earth. Mathematical instances they regarded as attributes of these substances.

Later thinkers such as the Pythagoreans, nevertheless, argued that these corporeal elements consisted, in fact, of mathematical objects such as points, planes, lines and numbers. In this way, they regarded mathematical entities as existing in themselves, prior and more universal to any bodies of matter. Pythagoreans considered numbers to be the first principles.

**(antithesis)** Yet, how can suprasensible thought-objects like numbers and lines bring forth sense-perceptible matter? If mathematical instances are eternal and unchanging, how do they constitute the world of becoming? In what way do we account for continuous change, generation and destruction? We can clearly make a case that mathematical objects are not the substances which make up the material world but rather simply have the potential to appear in it.

**Chapter 6 – Aporiai 13 to 15**

**Aporia 13**

**(problem)** Why do we find it necessary to posit an additional class of entities, i.e. the (Platonic) forms, beside the sense-perceptible and the mathematical ones?

**(thesis)** Much like the letters of the alphabet, there is an infinite variety of ways we may combine mathematical expressions. Thus, we have to accept that the objects of mathematics lack numerical unity, i.e. a limit in number and only have a limit in kind or formal unity.

This is ground enough for the Platonists to propose the forms to exist as substances which maintain both a numerical and a formal unity and advance them as the first principles of being.

**(antithesis)** If we suppose, however, that the forms do exist, then we have to deal with all the problems, pitfalls and paradoxes which we expressed previously, including aporiai 5, 8, 9 and so forth.

**Aporia 14**

**(problem)** Do the principles exist potentially or actually?

clarification → When we speak about potentiality in Aristotle, we mean the possibility of a thing to exist. Actuality, in this regard, is the fulfilment of a possibility, the coming of a potentiality into being. Thus, potentiality always precedes actuality, i.e. a thing may exist actually only if there is potential for it to exist in the first place.

**(thesis)** If the principles exist in actuality, then we have to admit what constitutes the potentiality of their existence as prior and more fundamental to them.

**(antithesis)** If we admit the first principles as potentialities, however, how can they constitute the substance of actual things?

**Aporia 15**

**(problem)** Are the principles universal or particular?

**(thesis)** At variance with platonic theory, if we count the first principles as universals, we cannot consider them as the substances which make up individual things or we end up in a paradox. Rather, we view them as classes or species which indicate shared qualities that group together individual things.

**(antithesis)** If, however, the first principles exist as a multitude of particulars, then they no longer fulfil the preconditions for us to gain knowledge of them as the knowledge of any one thing proceeds from the universals.

**A few closing Remarks**

The dialogues of Aristotle remain lost to us. Yet, two different voices spring forward as Aristotle articulates each argument in this book. Afterall, if we are to gain knowledge of his aporiai do not we ourselves have to draw universals from where each thesis and antithesis proceed?

One voice puts mind over matter. It is first a Pythagorean voice; it deals exclusively with mathematical objects. Yet, as the argument develops this interlocutor leans more towards Platonism and the theory of the forms leaves mathematics at the interstice between the world of being and becoming. The Eleatics and Parmenides lurk always at the edges. They are dei ex machina who Aristotle summons when he wants this voice to trip on its own arguments. Eleatic Monism, as Aristotle puts it forward, is Platonism taken to its natural conclusion, rife with paradoxes, reduced to absurdity.

The other voice is matter-oriented. This interlocutor tries to explain the sense-perceptible world by sense perceptible means, matter with matter. It is the voice of an Ionian physicist. Empedocles is referenced by name. Yet, as we go from argument to argument, we distinguish a Heraclitean voice more than anything, i.e. a voice which talks of an ever-changing world where everything is in motion and nothing can be truly known. (We are reminded here of Socrates‘ recounting of the Heraclitean doctrine in the Platonic dialogue “Thaetetus”)

We might speculate that Aristotle did write a dialogue between an Athenian stranger and an Ionian physicist. With that being said, it is only in the split, the gap between the two groups of arguments that Aristotle wants to locate his own voice, his theory on the knowledge of the first principles.",3

2003,stocks,"&gt; Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who normally favors loose policy and low rates, said Tuesday that the central bank needs to act quickly and aggressively to drive down inflation.

&gt; In a speech for a Minneapolis Fed discussion, Brainard said that policy tightening will include a speedy reduction in the balance sheet and a steady pace of interest rate increases. Her comments indicated that rate moves could be higher than the traditional 0.25 percentage point moves.

&gt; “Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” she said in prepared remarks. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”

&gt; The Fed already has approved one interest rate increase: a 0.25% hike at the March meeting that was the first in more than three years and likely one of many this year.

&gt; In addition, markets expect the Fed to lay out a plan at its May meeting for running down some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets, primarily Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, on its balance sheet. According to Brainard’s Tuesday comments, that process will be swift.

&gt; “The Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,” she said. “Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19.”

&gt; Back then, the Fed allowed $50 billion in proceeds to roll off each month from maturing bonds and reinvested the rest. Market expectations are that the pace could double this time around.

&gt; The moves are in response to inflation running at its fastest pace in 40 years, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Market expectations are for rate increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points.

2009,stocks,"I'm planning on buying shares in a number of ETF's so I'm trying to get an understanding of their differences. Probably the most obvious difference is whether an ETF is accumulating or distributing.

I get the basic idea, a distributing fund will pay dividends to the share holders who can then optionally buy more shares or spend the money elsewhere. An accumulating fund will reinvest the money automatically which increases the NAV of the fund. 

I've probably read every page google has turned about this and I'm still confused. I understand the NAV is defined as the net asset value / outstanding shares but I'm not sure how this value changes and it's relationship to the current price of the fund stock. 

I think I've figured out accumulating funds: the dividend income is used to purchase more underlying shares but the number of fund shares stays the same so the overall NAV goes up.

I've [read](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/how-do-dividends-affect-net-asset-value-nav-mutual-funds.asp) that the NAV of a distributing fund drops when they distribute, I'm not 100% sure I understand this. My best guess is that because the dividend payment is counted towards the asset value when that money is payed out the asset value drops so the NAV drops.

Now we come to share price: VUSA is currently trading at 65.77, VUAG at 63.91. The only material difference between these two ETF's (that I can see) is VUSA is distributing and VUAG is accumulating. Is it just coincidence they are nearly the same price? I, perhaps naively, would have expected the price of VUAG to be higher since reinvestment of the dividends causes the fund to own more underlying stock which surely would push up the price?

If anyone is wondering, I'm investing through a tax free savings scheme so VUAG makes more sense. I've previously invested a little in VUSA which I'll probably switch to VUAG once I understand this! Many thanks.",4

I've recently been picking up the basics of DCF as a way to value stocks and I'm clear on the details that go into the model. A big part of the model comes from the assumptions in revenue / expenses / earnings projections into the future.

What can I do to get better at making rational financial projections?

Also, where can i get more details about analyst financial projections into the future (and even their reasoning behind these numbers if possible?)

# [Stock futures slip in early morning trading after tech-led rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slipped in early morning trading Tuesday as traders continue to assess the bond market’s warning signals and the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 60 points lower, or 0.18%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down more than 0.1% each.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose broadly Tuesday, but rates on some shorter-term bonds continued to trade above their longer-dated counterparts. The 5-year yield climbed to 2.6%, while the 30-year rate traded around 2.525%. However, the key part of the yield curve briefly uninverted Tuesday, with the 2-year yield trading marginally below its 10-year counterpart.
*****
&gt; These so-called yield curve inversions have historically preceded recessions, so they are closely watched by investors.
*****
&gt; Investors also kept an eye on Europe, as the war between Ukraine and Russia dragged on. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged to pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces, noting that more than 300 people were killed and tortured in a suburb near the capital of Kyiv. (Click here for the latest.)
*****
&gt; “Markets have been resilient given the war in Ukraine, continued price pressures, and uncertain global economic outlook, with investors’ ‘buy the dip’ mentality driving equity returns,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.
*****
&gt; Oil prices, which have shot up since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions, climbed Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.9% at $104.23 per barrel. Brent crude gained 0.7% to $108.30.
*****
&gt; Those moves come after a tech-led rally that saw the Nasdaq Composite rise 1.9% on Monday. Shares of Twitter surged 27% for its best day ever after Elon Musk disclosed a 9.2% passive stake in the social media company. On Tuesday, the stock was up another 1.8%.
*****
&gt; The blue-chip Dow rose about 100 points to begin the trading week, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.8%, both posting their second straight day of gains.
*****
&gt; “In the near-term, we believe indiscriminate selling has created attractive entry points, particularly into some high-growth-potential stocks,” Tony DeSpirito, CIO of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock, said in a note.
*****
&gt; The new quarter has kicked off after the major averages finished their worst quarter in two years. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes Wednesday for further clues on the central bank’s rate-hike path. Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season is set to begin next week.

Did i really just miss the date by one day or is it still possible to buy today, since i also read another part where it says:  ""**The record date for the stock dividend is the close of business on April 5, 2022**""

Note: I have developed an analytical process that aim at quickly uncovering the catalysts that radically point unto the "" fair Value"" of a security regardless of its current market price. I deem that Value and Price do not equate but rather merge over time. Valuation is subjective while Price is a variable that is influenced by many externalities and forces. Only Time may effectively clear the fog about the Price Value margin scale of a security. Unfortunately, within the current FIAT driven monetary standard, excesses and "" errors"" in valuation thrive much longer than necessary. 

Patience and Resilience is therefore necessary for any VALUE DRIVEN ANALYST!

REGENCELL BIOSCIENCE HOLDING is a Hong Kong based TCM ( Traditional Chinese Medicine) company purporting to cure neurocognitive disorders and degeneration, primarily attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. The CEO's father is the "" scientific grand wizard"" claiming to have formulated a cure for all types of ailment ranging from ADHD to the COVID.

The company has never produced $1 in revenue and its stock price is still hovering near its all time high. the CEO own 80% of the shares and has been supporting the security price by consistently buying up its tiny trading float in order to prevent a collapse. 

This is effectively my second analysis on the stock as I had recently put out a post on the fraudulent Nature of the stock. 

But today, I would like to pinpoint  an abhorrent scheme that I have uncovered behind this stock that makes my stomach churn and highlights the deficiency of our financial markets that effectively allows schemers, fraudsters, and opportunists to exploit our capital market for self enrichment. 

&amp;#x200B;

This Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D (this “**Amendment No. 3**”) amends and supplements the Schedule 13D (the “**Schedule 13D**”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**SEC**”) on July 27, 2021 (as amended to date, the “Schedule 13D”) by Mr. Yat-Gai Au, a Hong Kong citizen, and Regencell (BVI) Limited., a limited liability company organized in British Virgin Islands (“**Regencell (BVI) Limited**,” and together with Mr. Yat-Gai Au, the “**Reporting Persons**”), with respect to the ordinary shares of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited (the “**Company**” or “**Issuer**”), with par value $0.00001 per share (the “**Ordinary Shares**”). Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning set forth in the Schedule 13D.

&amp;#x200B;

"" On October 30, 2014, Mr. Yat-Gai Au acquired 10,000 Ordinary Shares of the Issuer in a private transaction pursuant to the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. On September 28, 2020, Mr. Yat-Gai Au transferred the 10,000 Ordinary Shares to Regencell (BVI) Limited, which is wholly owned by Mr. Yat-Gai Au. On March 18, 2021, the Issuer issued a convertible note to Mr. Yat-Gai Au in the principal amount of $3,250,000 (the “**Note**”), pursuant to the exemption from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation S promulgated thereunder, automatically convertible into Ordinary Shares, upon the completion of the Company’s initial public offering, at the same price as the offering price per Ordinary Shares to be issued in the initial public offering to Mr. Yat-Gai Au or his designees.

**On May 31, 2021, the Company effectuated a forward split at a ratio of 1,000-for-1 to increase its authorized capital shares from 100,000,000 Ordinary Shares with a par value of $0.01 per share to 100,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares with a par value of $0.00001 per share (the “2021 Forward Split”)**.

**On July 20, 2021, the Issuer issued 342,105 Ordinary Shares to Regencell (BVI) Limited, designee of Mr. Yat-Gai Au, pursuant to the Note. As a result of the 2021 Forward Split and conversion of the Note, Mr. Yat-Gai Au indirectly owns and controls 10,342,105 Ordinary Shares of the Issuer through his 100% ownership of Regencell (BVI) Limited.**

Between the filing of Schedule 13D on July 27, 2021 and November 19, 2021, Regencell (BVI) Limited acquired a total of 50,479 Ordinary shares from open market purchases at an aggregate price of $1,125,807. Between the filing of Schedule 13D Amendment No. 1 on November 22, 2021 and December 29, 2021, Regencell (BVI) Limited acquired a total of another 35,381 Ordinary Shares from open market purchases at an aggregate price of $946,044. Between the filing of Schedule 13D Amendment No. 2 on December 30, 2021 and March 31, 2022, Regencell (BVI) Limited acquired a total of another 62,184 Ordinary Shares from open market purchases at an aggregate price of $1,821,204. Regencell (BVI) Limited used Mr. Yat-Gai Au’s personal funds to effect these purchases of Ordinary Shares.""

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, from the comfort of his office, mr YAT-GAI AU has been able to transform a 3.25M investment scheme into 80% of a company valued recently at close to 500M while never having brought a product to market, made a sale, let alone earn a profit. Essentially, the entire undertaking was aimed at pirating the USA capital markets from the onset through security GAMESMANSHIP! 

The only objective of the undertaking is to dump shares on some naive speculators and run with the money.!!

RGC ( Regencell biotech holdings) is a TOTAL, SHAMELESS, AND ABHORRENT FRAUD WORTH $0!!

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2027,stocks,"# If You Had To Point Out The Flaws Of The Stock Market Relative To Other Asset Classes What Would They Be?

There’s a long list of them, high volatility, sequence of return risk, low cashflow, high efficiency and liquidity (this could be a pro or con depending on how you look at it), lack of significant leverage, etc.

Out of all those things however, we’re gonna focus on two of them. The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 7-12% with a cash on cash return ideally around 15% or higher. This is because 1: real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely, it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2: investment properties typically only need a 20% down payment in order to purchase.

That’s a 5:1 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.

Now it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields, however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.

[You can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the S&amp;P 500 for reference.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b7b177-77f7-4479-a1bb-f3c197adc097_1266x594.png) Or you can look at [this Investopedia article.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/071616/history-sp-500-dividend-yield.asp)

# Luckily, We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options

This is the whole premise of the theta-gang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of “dividend yield.”

So we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. That’s great, but if we compare it back to real estate, we’re still missing the essential component of leverage.

**That’s where leveraged ETFs come in.**

The pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated, but what settled it for me personally was [this post by hedgefundie](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007) and [this article about volatility decay](https://www.afrugaldoctor.com/home/leveraged-etfs-and-volatility-decay-part-2). If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down [the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this post](https://premiumincomeinvestments.substack.com/p/using-debt-to-make-our-portfolio?r=1awcwu&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web). But basically, assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.

Surely that should work right?

Well it should… if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.

Leveraged ETFs suffer from something called “volatility decay,” basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred, a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.

So because we have more vulnerability to downside, let’s protect ourselves using a bit of probability.

# Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities

Let’s just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes, they are based on data, but if we don’t have access to said data, the movements may as well be random.

Under this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50% chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.

On top of that, we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements, mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a “relatively” higher ability to make a significant move in either direction, but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.

A good example of this how wild Tesla’s swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric, but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.

Now these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of “standard deviation.”

Standard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame (usually a year) a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility (its ability to make wild swings like Tesla).

([Image I found that best illustrates the standard normal distribution I'm talking about](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a804d0a-1dd0-4ab0-ac16-994ad6ebfb38_1478x914.png))

As you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc) there is less of a probability that our data (or in this case the stock price) will fall into this range given a “normal distribution.”

If you add up all the percentages between -1 and 1 we get a 68.2% chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the -2 and 2 then we get a 95.4% chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8% chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher, albeit at a much slower rate.

# So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options?

Using these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that, we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money (which is what we don’t want).

To find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ (QQQ leveraged 3x) the implied volatility is 65.40% at this time of writing.

Using this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.

The formula looks like this:

(sqrt(option days until expiration/365)) \* implied volatility \* current stock price

In written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365, then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.

That gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68% of the time.

Right now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised, so we’ll sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ ($61.55) the first standard deviation out of the money would be $51.23 (which is also 61.55 - 10.32).

If we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart (the side that represents our OTM options) we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9% that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration. If we are selling monthly options, this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me, those seem like pretty good odds.

So let’s go down to the $51 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $116 per contract right now. That’s a 2.27% ROI in 24 days or 34.05% annually.

If we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 27.24% CAGR.

# But Wait, Isn’t This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ?

This is the beauty of it, you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation, but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.",4

2033,stocks,"I am currently looking at several financial conglomerates: B. Riley Financial (RILY), Oppenheimer Holdings. Cowen, and Jefferies Financial Group. These companies are all trading around the 3-5 P/E range, have gross margins over 80%, and strong growth in both sales and earnings.

Of these companies, I have been primarily looking at B. Riley Financial (RILY). Valuation wise, the company has 92% gross margins, 11% ROI, 25% profit margins. Riley is also growing its sales and profits extremely fast at annual growth rates of 67% and 56% in the past 5 years. At current prices, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 4.3% and a plan for $50 million in share buybacks was recently approved.

Insiders own a large portion of the company already at 27% and are still buying significant amounts of the stock. The management looks strong overall with the CEO being the founder and heavily invested in the company. It seems like he is aggressively pushing expansion through acquisitions.

One main downside to Riley is its debt which has grown quickly as the company has increased its acquisitions. Riley has $3.9 billion in cash with $4.2 billion in debt. The long-term debt/equity ratio is high at ~3. Additionally, a large portion of the company's sales and revenue growth is not organic and comes from acquisitions or from the shell company boom. Their revenues from some divisions are also very cyclical, such as underwriting and liquidations.

Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) and Cowen (COWN) have better balance sheets but growth is slower and management is less invested. Cowen looks to be the more interesting of the two with 35% annual sales growth in the past 5 years and some recent insider buying. Both seem exposed to cyclic revenues with their involvement in IPOs and general market participation.

  Hey stock traders &amp; investors, we felt it was essential for us to have a small ""fireside"" talk and remind everyone of our rules regarding meme stocks, penny stocks, and crypto. 
Currently, we are receiving a lot of reports, and mod mails around ""meme"" stocks and crypto, and we want to clear the air here.
Lately, we're seeing more &amp; more posts regarding meme stocks. We define meme stocks as a stock that has a significant following (like a cult) from a non-traditional trader; attracts considerable social media attention surrounding the stock; cult members follow mentions and brigade by sharing mass links upvote regardless of the quality; thread jacking every post and spamming the meme stock so no other stock can be discussed.

The main goal of the cult for any meme stock is to pump the price. 

 These are different from penny stocks which we class as stocks that have traded less than $5 / share over the last six months or have a market cap of less than $300m.

But penny stocks share something in common with meme stocks: The pump in price. However, they go through extreme pump &amp; dump campaigns continually losing value making them ""cheap"" and where you encourage others to buy 100s of 1000s of shares thinking ""cheap"" is a good deal but the penny stock promoter sells their shares at the top of the pump, then repeats at a lower price convincing you to buy another round of 100s of 1000s of shares, either through group chats, spamming social media, or forums like these; it is illegal and will not be tolerated and you will face a ban.

 Crypto: We do not have any plans to allow crypto or NFT talk here that are unrelated to stocks. This subreddit is for stocks only. We will keep expanding crypto-related stocks like COIN if those discussions are related to the **quantitative**, **fundamental**, and **technical** aspects of said stock such as **price movements, cashflow, C-staff changes such as CEO replacements, earnings reports, product changes that will affect the stock price, etc**.
 
 Crypto specific or NFT specific posts will not be permitted and the mods will remove those posts. Repeat offenders will be banned.
We are aware that GME is pushing for an NFT store; GME has sales of $6B TTM so if the NFT store makes, let's say, less than 5% of the $6B sales ($300m TTM) we'll consider it crypto spam/shilling and remove it; **NFT hype for stocks is going to be considered crypto shilling.**

 Our best examples of meme stocks are AMC &amp; GME, see the wiki below how we determined meme stocks in depth, but we all know GME is a meme and has several cults on Reddit. If you want to spam about GME then you can do that on other sub reddit, see the links and wikis below. 

 **We actually allow discussions on meme stocks.**  However, we need to ensure that we do not become simply a meme stock sub drowning in a flood of posts discussing the same exact stock every day, and to do that, we implemented some protocols we set up in 2020 when the meme stock mania took hold:
* We will limit the number of posts that are submitted to r/stocks that are around meme stocks.
* They must be high quality and based upon verifiable data.
  * News must come from a mainstream news broadcaster that focuses on stocks (for example, we will permit the Financial times, CNBC etc. but not Fox, BBC etc.).
  * Automod will remove Twitter or youtube posts. Automod will police this, and the method it decides what is low effort or not will change dynamically to deal with the volume of mentions of said meme stock.
 * We will not permit any conspiracy theories at all. There needs to be evidence and grounded.
  * While we have a criteria for meme stocks (see wiki below), the mods will have full discretion at all times. Simply posting the meme stock ticker and nothing else or similar low effort comments will be removed, and circumventing automod or another mod will result in a ban.
 * And with the help of the r/stocks community, whenever someone uses the report button to identify shilling, it helps the mod team focus their efforts on actual shilling and spam; thanks! 

 The users of r/stocks don't want to discuss the same exact stock multiple times a day, every single day, and we don't want to be shilled to.

We're desperately trying to warn the community of the manipulation that's going on here just to get you to pour your money into these types of things so that they can sell at a higher price and you're left holding the bag with no one to sell to. That's not how you build wealth in the long term with stocks.

2052,stocks,"I'm looking to refine my investing strategy and am looking at stock replacement with calls vs purchasing stocks. Right now, I'm thinking the following for SR:

* growth orientated (more dramatic movement expected)
* less than 2% dividend
* buy with delta around .8+, depending on volume and spread
* 6-9 months left and reevaluate at \~2-3 months
* I will also likely do a covered call-like strategy, selling monthly calls at .1 delta

2056,stocks,"Hey guys,

**This post is only about the mindset not how to pick the right stock, value investing etc.** 

For me the most important thing in trading is having the right mindset. 

\- I have a group of friends and we talk about stocks a lot, and we all have the exact same knowledgebut still we have very different results.

\- My step-father know nearly nothing about stocks but still he makes good profit

How come ?

**Know your risk and stay in your zone:**

If you buy a risky stock be prepared for big winnings but also more important for big loses. I have friend who called me at night who said that he can’t handle it anymore because his portfolio is -30% down and sold everything..... I saw it in the forum here as well.

If you buy a stock long-term and it dips after 2-3 years and you are unphased by it ! Congratulation !

**Long-term thinking:**

We are all greedy to some extent and want to make money quick! More trading will not make you faster rich. The right decisions will do!

**Trading is 95% of the time reading and 5% executing** not the other way around! I saw enough people who nearly trade their stocks weekly and jump from one to another. I have friend who called me and said he wants to make 1k a month with 2-3 trades a week and how is it possible to achieve...

**Gambling:**

I like to gamble with friends, but I always have a set limit of 20€-30€. My goal is having max fun and not winnings!

With trading I want the opposite, max money and not max fun therefore **I don’t gamble when I trade!**

There are people who gamble and won a lot of money, short term with options/future but this is gambling it’s like winning the lottery you need luck no skill. Stay away from it.

If you have a  gambling mindset, trading is not for you!

&amp;#x200B;

**Its money:**

Don’t forget, it’s real money and probably your life savings! Never lose the feeling of it. It is very easy especially with day trading to lose the feeling for it and go full yolo into it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you always brooke and have always depts watch out ! Get your finance stuff together first!

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotions:**

Emotions and trading don’t go well together. You buy a stock because you believe you make money with it not because elon musk is really cute and driving a tesla is cool.

**Role Models:**

Always look up at people who are in the long-term more successful than you are. If you want to be like Jordan Belfort (The guy from Wolf of Wallstreet) I have bad news for you. He was a scum who ripped of people there is nothing to admire about this guy. I liked the movie tho.

Pick the right ones! These can even be your parents or someone you know!

**Goals:**

Having goals is important! Why are you doing it? My goal is to retire one day and have some good money left. If you want to drive a lambo in the next 2 years. ehm again I have bad news for you...

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary  :**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Know your risk

\- Invest dont gamble

\- Never lose the feeling of money

\- No emotions

\- Think (a lot) before you act

\- Set goals

\- Choose the role model

\- Be patient

If you want to add something or ask, feel free !

Thank you",4
2057,stocks,"If you have a stock that you intend to hold long-term, but whose price explodes 20-40% over a week, and you feel that price increase is a big over reaction to some small news, does it make sense to sell some or all of your position?

It feels like it may make sense to sell some of it, with the intention to buy back in when the price drops. But if you're sure the price is going to drop, does it make more sense to sell your entire position instead of just some?

Are there any tax concerns that need to be taken into account when selling some of a position whenever it moons and buying back in later?

Or is all of this a fools errand and I should just buy and hold?

An example of a stock that actually did this, would be EVGO last November, when it doubled in price over \`\`\`a week due the infrastructure bill passing and then immediately fell back to earth.",4
2058,stocks,Is there an app or a calculator where I can enter in certain stocks and amount of shares to get a total value for the portfolio? I'm trying to compare portfolios but only have access to an old screenshot.,4
2059,stocks,"It was announced that Musk held more than 73.48 million shares of Twitter, holding a 9.2% stake. Twitter shares rose to 20% after Tesla CEO Musk reported his stake in Twitter.

It seems like it's a strange law that Musk owns a certain stock, they all go up.

What do you think will happen to Twitter stock in the future? Whether Musk will keep holding Twitter stock.",4
2060,stocks,"Im going to approach this from a theoretical perspective. The Generation from 1980 to 2000 was born with internet in hand and it has accelerated from 2000 to 2010. Africans know more about American culture than you do thanks to Facebook, twitter, YouTube and now instagram in past few years.

The Arab spring was born in the internet. The new generation is heavily involved and they are molded by it. As these people enter the work life and getting settled with family life etc, they are not afraid or technology impaired like their parents to shop in internet. Latest bike, latest soccer shoes being pimped by Ronaldo in his his Instagram / Nike connection etc

Im approaching this from a general view. The previous generation transitioning into current adult life are more addicted to internet than Americans.

I have a few shares in Jumia and I think they are coming at perfect time. Its run by young techies and they have developed the logistics and have the data. Orders might be slow, problems adapting etc but I think the value of company is actually in the platform they have developed.

Holding long term is good idea as they sort out the culture shift, local problems etc

I guess what Im trying to say is the new generation in Africa is very Americanized and totally different than their parents. Just like us in US, they are going to be looking for convenience in shopping.",4
2061,stocks,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 4th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are little changed to start the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were mostly flat Monday, as traders monitor the bond market’s warning signals about the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally higher. S&amp;P 500 futures were up about 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Twitter shares surged more than 25% after SEC filings revealed Elon Musk purchased a more than 9% passive stake in the social media company. It comes less than a week after Musk polled his followers, questioning whether the social media giant follows free speech principles. Based on Twitter’s Friday closing price, the stake is worth $2.89 billion.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares ticked higher by 1%, after the company reported on Saturday its latest quarterly electric vehicle delivery figures. The company delivered more than 310,000 EVs in the first quarter, up from 184,800 in the year-earlier period.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Starbucks shares dipped about 1% after the coffee chain suspended its share repurchase program.
*****
&gt; An often-cited recession signal was triggered Thursday evening when the the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2019. The 5-year note yield is also trading above its 30-year counterpart.
*****
&gt; “We think the current flattening is due to the concern that the Fed is behind the curve on hikes and will tighten policy beyond neutral, which will hurt growth,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Investors are also monitoring the latest developments in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Western nations will impose additional sanctions on Russia in the coming days.
*****
&gt; “Equity and bond markets continued to send conflicting signals about the economic outlook,” UBS said in a recent note to clients. “We caution against over-interpreting either signal. Yield curve inversions have historically predicted recessions with a long and uncertain lag, while hopes over cease-fire talks have ebbed and flowed,” the firm added.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posting gains Friday. The S&amp;P 500 also posted its third straight week of gains.
*****
&gt; Seasonally, April is generally one of the best months for stocks, edging higher in the last 20 years by 2.41% on average, MKM Partners’ JC O’Hara wrote in a note. Within 16 of the last 17 Aprils, the S&amp;P has also inched higher.
*****
&gt; Friday’s positive session came despite March’s employment report, which fell short of economists’ estimates. The U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs during the month, while estimates from Dow Jones called for 490,000.
*****
&gt; “Strong gains on the employment front continue to signal a green light for investors despite multi-decade highs in inflation and concerns over higher rates and Fed tightening,” noted Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The economy appears to be in exit velocity mode, with the only concern being the amount of labor supply available to fuel the robust recovery,” he added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee will publish the minutes from the central bank’s March meeting, giving investors a deeper understanding into how the Fed views market conditions.

2067,stocks,"CEO **Elon Musk** said on Sunday that the electric vehicle maker is aiming at a 30% gross margin or about 10% profitability including all costs for its **Supercharger** network business.

**What Happened:** Investor Ross Gerber had asked Musk if Tesla works on “a 50% gross margin on the energy cost,” and “if it is across the network or it varies by location?”

**Why It Matters:** Tesla reported overall automotive gross margins of 27% last year and 21% in 2020. The EV maker does not reveal a unit-wise margin breakup.

Tesla owns and operates over 30,000 Superchargers in over 2,564 locations globally, of this over 8,000 Superchargers are in China alone. The Musk-led company has been scaling up its supercharging network amid rising competition.

However, adjusted P/E ratios are pushing up against 40 and taking Michael Burry‘s stance on Index Funds into consideration, we might really have completely detached from a reliable price finding mechanism by just blindly pouring money into those indexed companies…

However, there must be a way to find out right? 

A companies valuation should represent the net present value of its future cash flows…

If we would determine the NPV of all companies within a specific index (DJ, or DAX maybe) and compare it to the current market valuation of the Index as a whole, we could easily determine on whether we‘re detached from it‘s true value, right?

Watching the doc Gaming Wall Street, the topic of ""naked short selling"" came up and spurred on some thoughts, which I would like to share. From my knowledge, GME had a short interest of 130%+, however, let's say the shorts had only borrowed 100% of the outstanding shares to short sell.

2086,stocks,"Lots of posts in r/investing and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) about the downturn....it was a bad quarter for most though March saw an uptick...Lots going on....whether it is the software bubble that looks to have popped in October 2021, or the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it seems everyone lost money. I'm telling you it doesn't have to be that way.

The Nasdaq is down 9% in 2022, the Dow is down 3%.  First quarter in eight that the indices fell. Hell, Zoom is down 80% from its 2020 high! I can't tell you what will happen Monday morning or next month or whether Russia will completely be forced out of Ukraine, but what I can tell you is that there is a way to do better.

In my view, here are the keys to investing:

1. **Get a diverse set of views.** Read a lot of investing articles. Understand the fundamentals of the businesses you buy. Read the bullish articles AND the bearish articles. Stay off of YouTube generally and head to Seeking Alpha, Bloomberg, and others. At any price that you see, that's the price at which about half of the active dollars are selling and half of the active dollars are buying. Even if you feel strongly about an investment, there are lots of people who feel the opposite. Ask yourself - why do other people disagree with you?
2. **Analyze your investments from a probability-based risk perspective.** When you are considering an investment, ask what is the case for this stock to go up 30% in the next 12 months and how likely is it? What is the case for the stock to fall 50%? How do the fundamentals of this stock compare to other stocks now (Is the P/E or P/S ratio higher or lower than others?)? How do the fundamentals of this stock compare to the same stock five years ago? Nobody wins on every investment, but if you try to consistently buy UNDERVALUED investments with more than average potential to rise, you will make more money.
3. **Diversify, diversify, diversify.** Make sure you consider investing across different asset classes - stocks, real estate/REITs, fixed income - and different industries. DO NOT put everything in FAANG or in tech stocks, because that is a great way to lose your money over time.
4. **Shoot for singles, not home-runs.** I watch my portfolio every day, multiple times a day. At the end of the day I ask myself...based on the price and market changes, has my opinion of my investments changed? If I keep my investments (which is most of the time), it is because I made a decision that my thesis is intact. If a stock has seen a big run, I'll take some off of my investment. If a stock is down a lot, I'll add some if I still believe in it. In my personal experience, I rarely see 100% returns on a given stock in year - almost never. I am looking for 0.1% 0.2% or 0.3% on my portfolio each DAY. Obviously, it doesn't happen like that but that is my mindset.
5. **Only sell investments when they are having up days and only buy when investments are having down days**. If you follow this rule every time, you will keep yourself from panic sells or buying when things are crazy.

Finally, for my own performance, how have I done +35% in 2022 through March 31 when the Nasdaq is down 9%? It's by investing in undervalued assets that the market hasn't been paying attention to. I basically NEVER buy tech stocks because their valuations are too rich and too many people talk about them. And this performance is not that new to me. Since 2012, I've done an annualized 31.2% after-tax, after-fee return compared with the Nasdaq 100 at 19.5% and Dow at 10.0% annualized return. **Over that time I've returned 1,883% on my portfolio.**

As of today, here are a few key investments to call out with upside relative to market expectations:

CLF (Cleveland Cliffs) - This steel producer had a great week this week as commodity prices are soaring. This stock trades at a forward cash flow multiple under 5 could see big further gains.  Its had a big run recently, but still looks undervalued.

TRTN (Triton International) - This is a container leasing company that has been selling 12-year leases at huge returns to shipping companies around the world. With all the upheaval, this company benefits. If you're looking for a ""subscription"" type company at a low PE of around 6, this company is likely to generate a ton of return.

PARA (Paramount Global) - The media company, formerly ViacomCBS, is HATED by some, but I love the transition to streaming and I believe there is room for four or five streaming players. The stock is turning around recently and the company is making good business decision. It is likely to be bought out by a big player in the next few years at a much higher valuation.

ELVT (Elevate Credit) - This small cap stock sells loans to near-prime customers. It trades at a dirt cheap valuation and looks poised to be very very profitable over next 12 months. Additionally, it recently resolved some long-stand litigation to its business model.

So here's the scenario: I have received stock options from work - let's say I can exercise 10 shares at $20 per share.  Cool, we're starting at $200 to purchase.  However! I needed to wait a year for the options to vest, and even though I can buy 10 for $20, the current stock price is $30.  It looks like I'm getting taxed on that $10 difference as an additional fee (this is via eTrade, in case that's relevant).

2 years later, the stock price is now $50 a share and I decide to sell my 10 shares for a ""profit"" of $300 ($50 - $20)\*10, and then come April those $300 get taxed as long-term capital gains.

Here is my question - it certainly looks like I was taxed twice - once for hypothetical, unrealized gains when first exercising those stock options, and then taxed a second time on actual gains when those stocks were later sold.  Is that accurate?  What is going on here?

I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**",4

Mainstream Media take is that it’s a big win for “the people” and a knock on “evil big tech”. 

My expectation is that Amazon will maintain a zero tolerance policy on unions and basically “deprecate” (to use a software term) warehouses that do unionize. In other words, they will either freeze future investment and growth in any warehouses that unionize or straight up shut them down. I think the news is net negative for Amazon stock, but won’t have as big of an effect as the media would like to tell it. Maybe $100M/year costs and losses for unionization, loss of warehouses, loss of productivity, and expenses to counteract unionization. I would also expect a much larger impact on costs that is harder to measure - upward pressure on compensation and benefits to lessen the appeal of unions. Upward pressure on compensation and benefits would also decrease employee acquisition costs, improve retention, and improve morale / productivity so the net effect is hard to guess.

I’m not a labor or Amazon expert so curious to hear other thoughts on the impact on the company and stock. Please no political opinions or opinions on unions themselves. There are plenty of threads in other subreddits for that.",4
2102,stocks,"Ok, listened to the compound podcast- heard something about VIX having a mean of 20 and a standard deviation (sigma) of 8. Guy also mentions that 20 and 36 are inflection points. I compared VIX and SPY on a chart and found this to be generally true- 36 VIX is typically a good time to buy a dip and 20 VIX can be a good time to sell if you had previously bought at 36. If you had bought at at VIX lower than 20, then 20 is a good time to sell. Obviously there will be exceptions, and VIX has gone much higher during 2008 and 2020 crashes, up to 60 and higher. EDIT: a 2 sigma move represents a 95% statistical probability. So hypothetically this method represents a 95% chance of working, with 5% risk, not including paying the premiums on the options. 

It appears to me that because wall street may use these metrics of the VIX as a trading signal that the charts end up reflecting large trading activity by investment banks and institutions. You also wouldn't want to speculate on individual stocks using VIX- more like using VIX as a signal to trade options on SPY.

It would theoretically look like this:

1. VIX hits 36. Buy slightly OTM calls 3-6 months+ to exp.
2. VIX approaches 20. Sell calls. Buy puts with stop loss. Same with slightly OTM, 3-6 months+
3. Sell puts when VIX spikes, buy calls again. Repeat as desired.

Currently VIX is at 19.62, just below 20. We appear to be at an inflection point where either the bull market is going to recover or we are headed for another leg down as rate hike fears, supply chain problems, and inflation hurt corporate earnings.",4

Due to time in the market, all of these have made money in total - lowest being 10%, highest 141% from the global technology one (I’ll probably keep this)

The other thing is I can afford to be more aggressive due  to the fact I’m 20 - I can afford the higher risk of investing outside of funds, plus dividends would be nice - the ideal scenario is higher growth plus a small dividend payment as this would be useful in my day to day life to cover expenses without selling things.

Euro-zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March from a year ago as Russia’s war in Ukraine further boosted already soaring energy costs.

While that’ll cost consumers about 230 billion euros ($254 billion) this year, household savings should help cushion the blow. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge rose to a fresh four-decade high, and China’s Covid lockdowns threaten to disrupt supply chains and push up prices even more.

Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:

**Europe**

Euro-zone inflation accelerated to a fresh record high as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global supply chains and provided a fresh driver for already-soaring energy costs. Combined with inflation overshoots this week from Spain and Germany, the data prompted investors to bring forward bets on when the European Central Bank will end almost eight years of negative interest rates.

The energy crisis gripping the euro area will inflict an extra bill on consumers equivalent to 1.8% of its gross domestic product, according to analysis by Bloomberg Economics. Increased heating and electricity costs, along with higher prices of fuel for motorists, will combine to add 230 billion euros ($255 billion) to households’ expenses, Jamie Rush and Maeva Cousin estimate.

U.K. households saved less of their income in the final quarter of last year to maintain living standards in an early sign of the pressures they face from runaway inflation.

**U.S.**

The U.S. added close to half a million jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell by more than expected, highlighting a robust labor market that’s likely to support aggressive Fed tightening in the coming months.

Inflation-adjusted consumer spending declined in February, suggesting the fastest pace of price increases in four decades is starting to temper demand. Spending on goods settled back after the prior month’s surge, while a decline in Covid-19 cases supported a pickup in outlays for services.

U.S. business profits surged 35% last year, the most since 1950, driven by strong household demand as the economy bounced back from the pandemic. In all four quarters of the year, the overall profit margin stayed above 13%, a level reached in just one other three-month period during the past 70 years, Commerce Department data show.

**Asia**

China’s Covid lockdowns are putting the economy under strain and threatening to disrupt global supply chains, prompting Beijing to call for more contingency plans to deal with the risks. Purchasing managers’ indexes for March showed lockdowns in the technology and trade center Shenzhen and automotive city Changchun cut factory activity in the month. Services have also been hit hard.

Japan’s factory output in February eked out the first gain in three months, offering only a tepid sign of resilience amid fears the economy has slipped back into reverse. The fractional gain comes at a time when the Japanese economy needs strong manufacturing to help the economy avoid a contraction this quarter and to power a recovery going ahead.

**Emerging Markets**

Colombia surprised markets with a smaller-than-expected interest rate increase after the central bank was criticized by senior politicians. Analysts had expected a bigger boost given recent inflation shocks and an economy that is now operating close to full capacity. Central banks in Chile, Czech Republic and Mozambique were among those that also hiked rates.

An exodus of foreign workers from Saudi Arabia started to reverse after a year and a half as the economy recovers from the pandemic and oil prices rally. Job creation is the biggest challenge facing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader, as he reshapes an economy dependent on exporting oil and importing foreign labor.

**World**

Governments are not sufficiently aware of the longer-lasting economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, says Laurence Boone, OECD’s chief economist. Earlier this month, the Paris-based OECD estimated that the conflict’s effects will reduce global growth this year by more than 1 percentage point and drive up inflation another 2.5 percentage points from already-high levels.",4

2112,stocks,"Western Digital is one of the companies that had terrible share price performance over the last 5 years, down over 40%.

This post is an attempt to understand the company's historical performance, how the company operates today, what's ahead of it, and finally, how much it is worth today.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Western Digital?**

In one sentence, this is a company that develops, manufactures, and provides data storage devices and solutions.

If there's one thing we know about data, it is that it keeps increasing, hence there's increased demand for solutions around it. These solutions are not only in personal computers and smart video systems, but in the last decade also in automotive, IoT, and various home applications.

So, we have a growing industry, yet, Western Digital's share price has declined from $80 to $50.

Attractive industries always attract more competitors. The higher the supply of products, the lower the price. Western Digital's sales experienced a huge drop during 2019 to $16.5b (compared to $20.6b the year before). The reason is oversupply and competition for flash-based products. 

It is worth mentioning that the innovation in this industry is very aggressive, so the value of the products is decreasing significantly when a new and better product is introduced. When faced with high competition and an oversupply of products, there's no option to defer the sale to a later point in time, as if that option is chosen, those products are likely to be sold at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The operating margin declined from 17.5% in 2018 to only 0.5% in 2019, all due to the drop in sales price and gross margin. Since then, the company started recovering. The operating margin increased to 2% in 2020, to 7.2% in 2021, and is up to 13.2% for the last twelve months.

If we measure the sales activities of the company through the cost of goods sold, it is quite clear that their activities didn't decline. The number of goods sold remained stable. The R&amp;D as % of revenue remained stable and during the last 5 years, the company even reduced the SG&amp;A from 25% to 20% of the total revenue.

However, one bad year was enough to cause fear among investors and question the ability of the company to innovate and stay on the top of its game. Although the company has been around for over 50 years, the innovation of new products is as important as it was on day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial position**

During the last 5 years, there are a few points to be noted related to the financial position:

1. The cash position decreased from $5b to $2.5b. Not because they were losing money, but because of the following two points.
2. The debt decreased from $11b to $7b (excluding leases). This roughly means, they generated an additional $1.5b to pay down debt from their regular operations. (not to mention, up until 2020, they were paying dividends)
3. A slight increase in PPE - is always a good sign which means their capacities have increased.

So, if we compare the balance sheet 5 years ago and today, it is clear that the company is in a better position than it was. Yet, the share price is much lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's next?**

If we take a look at the company's priorities, based on the investor presentation, they've noted three:

1. Reinvestment in the company - mainly through R&amp;D - no doubt that this is the most important use of funds. If this is not done, there will be no profitable company to run in a few years.
2. Reduced debt - Although it is at an acceptable level, one of their priorities is to further reduce it.
3. Shareholder return (through Dividends/share repurchases) - The company was a dividend-paying company between 2013 and 2020. I would not be surprised if they start paying dividends again within 2 years.

The market size (both for flash-based products and HDD) is expected to grow at around 4-5% year over year and analysts are projecting double-digit revenue growth. This is in line with management's expectations for the next year.

However, taking the fact that the company is operating in a highly competitive industry, I do not feel comfortable forecasting double-digit growth after the next 12 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation - Key assumptions**

As the valuation is based on certain assumptions, here are mine:

**Revenue growth** \- 10% in the next 12 months, followed by 2.5% growth afterward (equal to the current risk-free rate)

**Operating margin** \- 13% for the next year, followed by 14%. Although the margin was over 17% in the past, and there's a chance the company will get back there, there's also a chance to encounter another bad year, such as 2019.

**Discount rate** \- 9% (Based on WACC)

**Outcome -** The company's fair value is $22.5b ($72.18/share) - slightly undervalued at the moment based on my assumptions

&amp;#x200B;

**What if my assumptions are wrong?**

Based on my assumption, the company's revenue will grow by 37% in 10 years. However, I could be wrong.

So here are a couple of different scenarios related to the revenue and operating margin 10 years from now.

|Revenue / Op. margin|12%|14%|16%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|20% ($22.7b)|$55.3|$66.1|$76.9|
|37% ($25.2b)|$59.4|$72.2|$83.6|
|50% ($28.4b)|$62.3|$75.6|$88.9|
|100% ($37.9b)|$71.3|$88.5|$105.7|

In all of these scenarios, the company seems undervalued, in some more than others and it is quite clear that maintaining a high operating margin is more important than growing the revenue. If I am to invest in the company, I'll be more focused on the margins.

I hope you enjoyed the post, feel free to add your take on the company and provide feedback.",4

2114,stocks,"TESLA TO THE MOON! Apparently y’all thought this was a hit job on Tesla? I’m bullish 

Tesla delivered 310,048 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2022, below analysts estimates.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

After a rough start to 2022, Tesla shares are now up for the year as of Thursday’s close.

Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310,048

Electric vehicle production (total): 305,407

Over the same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

Analysts expected deliveries of 317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31. The estimates ranged from a low of 278,000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357,000.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

The company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg, Germany, and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and “cyber rodeo” event on April 7, at another new vehicle assembly plant it’s building in Austin, Texas.

Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin officially as of Dec. 1, but still operates its first electric car factory in Fremont, California.

Globally, Tesla’s operations during the quarter, which ended March 31, were weighed down by a Covid surge and new health restrictions in China, requiring temporary production halts at its Shanghai plant. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs, marking a record for the company. 

Tesla, along with the rest of the auto industry, has also been hurt by widespread parts shortages, and inflation. Critical components like semiconductors remain in short supply, and prices have increased for raw materials like nickel and aluminum after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February. In the U.S., Tesla has been leaving customers waiting for months before filling their car orders.

I’m still bullish! 180k deliveries same time last year compared to 300k",4
2115,stocks,"SoftBank has liquidated almost all of the positions in its abortive internal hedge fund SB Northstar after racking up between $6bn and $7bn in losses in the unit behind the notorious “Nasdaq whale” trades. 

The future of the Japanese technology conglomerate’s buccaneering trading unit has been in doubt since November, when SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son told investors “the company called SB Northstar . . . is about to come to an end”.  

Akshay Naheta, the former Deutsche Bank trader based in Abu Dhabi who ran the unit, left SoftBank on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. The 40-year-old is known for executing complex derivative transactions and earned notoriety for spearheading SoftBank’s controversial bet on the shares of fraudulent payments company Wirecard.  

Regulatory filings show that SB Management — Northstar’s investment manager — held a little over $1bn in US-listed stocks at the end of 2021, down from more than $17bn one year earlier. The bulk of its remaining positions were in special purpose acquisition companies, including vehicles sponsored by its own Vision Fund, SoftBank shareholder Elliott Management and Vision Fund investor Mubadala.  

The winding down of Northstar comes as SoftBank looks to slow investments across the group as it seeks to raise cash amid falling tech stocks and a regulatory crackdown in China. 

A person familiar with its portfolio said that most of its European investments were liquidated around the same time, including a $5bn bet on Swiss drugmaker Roche that had been profitable. The person added that there were less than a handful of positions left, which had been transferred to SoftBank Group. 

“I don’t think there’s a reason for them to dump anything else immediately, because there are other things that they can sell that are more liquid,” he said, noting that a recent rebound in SoftBank’s Chinese technology stocks had eased pressure on the group to raise cash. 

In its 2021 annual results presentation last month, SoftBank disclosed that Northstar had lost $4.6bn over the course of its brief existence, mainly because of disastrous derivative bets. One person familiar with its trading activity said this would likely climb to $6bn following the liquidation, while another pegged it at close to $7bn.  

SoftBank said: “As Mr Son explained during SoftBank’s earnings presentation last November, SB Northstar’s activities and its portfolio have been significantly reduced.”  

SoftBank launched Northstar in August 2020 with initial capital of $555mn — a third of this coming from Son himself. That disguised the unit’s far larger firepower, obtained through loans of cash and publicly traded securities from SoftBank’s vast balance sheet.  

The rapid rise and fall of Northstar has added to longstanding corporate governance concerns at SoftBank over the company’s ability to place adequate checks on its billionaire founder Son.  

Son holds a third of the unit personally and was the driving force behind its outsized derivative bets on US technology stocks that stunned the market in 2020. In September of that year, the Financial Times unmasked SoftBank as the “Nasdaq whale” that had bought billions of dollars’ worth of US equity derivatives, which other traders blamed for exacerbating big swings in the prices of technology stocks.   


Son disclosed last year that his holding in Northstar had personally cost him about $1.5bn, a figure that will have increased given the further losses incurred unwinding its portfolio.  

One of the people familiar with Northstar said it was unclear when the 64-year old SoftBank founder would cover these personal losses.  

“When is SoftBank going to collect the money? It’s an IOU,” he said.  

Northstar’s remaining positions include British retailer THG and Norwegian e-learning platform Kahoot, which both have SoftBank executive Andreas Hansson on their boards. Hansson is due to leave the group at the end of April, however, according to people familiar with the matter.  

THG’s share price is down 85 per cent since SoftBank purchased $730mn of its shares last May. The formerly hyped British online retailer’s stock price slide has turned into one of the London stock market’s highest-profile fiascos in years. The collapse in value means SoftBank is unlikely to exercise an option to invest $1.6bn in THG’s Ingenuity subsidiary.  

When Son revealed the staggering level of personal losses accrued through Northstar late last year, he admitted making bets on himself was “tough”, but added that he remained undeterred, with the company revealing his investments in SoftBank’s Latin American funds.  

“I am going to take risk again,” Son said at the time.

So I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.

Someone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.

Today Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.

Anyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!

How's my plan? Monday hopefully I can start selling AAPL.

Thanks all and may the force be with you.",4
2125,stocks,"8:30 this mornin. U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by a seasonally adjusted 431,000 in March, below market expectations and the smallest increase since November last year.

The U.S. unemployment rate recorded 3.6% in March, which was lower than market expectations and continued to hit a new low since February 2020.

Bloomberg Intelligence's chief U.S. rates strategist: The report appears to be enough to widen concerns that inflation will remain high, which could mean the yield curve will flatten further ahead of the CPI report later this month rise. Currently, the market is expecting a 17bps inversion of the 2Y/10Y yield curve by this time next year, and we see no reason to think that won't happen until the market has priced in.

# **Markets will be looking for clues from the Fed ahead, as historically strong month gets underway - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/markets-will-be-looking-for-clues-from-the-fed-ahead-as-historically-strong-month-gets-underway.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is heading into what promises to be a volatile second quarter, but April is traditionally the best month of the year for stocks.
*****
&gt; The major indices were higher in March, but they turned in a weak performance for the first quarter, the worst since the pandemic. Investors have been worried about rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and inflation, which was made even worse by disruptions in commodities exports from both Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Stocks are typically higher in April, and it is historically the best month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. The S&amp;P has been higher 70% of the time and has gained an average 1.7% in all Aprils since World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. For all months, the S&amp;P averaged a gain of 0.7%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.6% in March, and Stovall said the rally could continue. “I think we get back to breakeven, but then I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another pullback or correction before we have an end of year rally,” he said.
*****
&gt; Market focus in the week ahead will remain squarely on developments around the Ukraine war and on the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday is scheduled to release minutes from its March meeting, where it raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
*****
&gt; There are also a handful of Fed speakers, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who speaks Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Greg Faranello, AmeriVet Securities head of U.S. rates, said the Fed minutes could be the highlight of the week since the central bank is likely to provide more detail on its plans to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed has nearly $9 trillion in securities on its balance sheet, and a reduction of those holdings would be another step to tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “The market is curious. They’re going to be looking for some clues in terms of how quickly, how big, what the caps look like,” said Faranello.
*****
&gt; The economic data calendar is light, with factory orders Monday, international trade and ISM services Tuesday and wholesale trade Friday.
*****
&gt; Traders will also be watching for any comments from companies ahead of the first-quarter earnings reporting season, which starts in mid-April.
*****
&gt; “The first-quarter earnings have actually been improving in the last month, so that’s encouraging,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; # Farewell to first quarter
&gt; The Dow was off 4.6% for the first quarter, while the S&amp;P 500 was down 5%. The worst performer by far was the Nasdaq, down 9.1%. In the past week, stocks were barely changed. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the S&amp;P was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Interest rates also moved dramatically during the quarter, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield temporarily touching a high of 2.55% in the past week, after starting the quarter at 1.51%.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the 10-year was yielding 2.37%, while the two-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, was at 2.45%. The two-year was yielding 0.73% at the beginning of the year.
*****
&gt; Faranello said bond yields can keep going higher on inflation concerns, but they could consolidate before another big move.
*****
&gt; “I think the market is looking for a new catalyst here,” he said. “I just think the first quarter has been about repricing the market, and we’ve done that...The Fed came out very hawkish. We made made a dramatic repricing. Now, we need to see more data to see how this is going to evolve in the second quarter.”
*****
&gt; Stovall said the S&amp;P 500′s first-quarter performance is one of the 15 worst first quarters, going back to 1945. After those weak quarters, down 3.8% or more, the second quarter was better on average. This year’s first-quarter decline was tied with 1994, which had the 12th worst first quarter.
*****
&gt; After those 15 weak first quarters, “we actually climbed 4.8% in the second quarter and rose in price two out of every three times,” he said. But for the full year, the S&amp;P 500 gained just 40% of the time, and was down an average 2% in those years.
*****
&gt; But this year is a midterm election year, and in those years the second and third quarters are typically the weakest. “Of those 15 worst quarters, five of them were midterm election years, and of those five, the second quarter was up an average 1%, and it rose in price only 40% of the time,” Stovall said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the market could be higher in the second quarter, but it will face headwinds. “Oil prices are likely to remain up. Interest rates are certainly not coming down,” he said, adding geopolitical pressures are likely to remain. “I see the possibility of a 1% gain. We could probably eke out something good.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were held hostage by rising and volatile oil prices in the first quarter, as the world scrambled to make up for Russia’s export barrels. Many customers refused to buy Russian oil for fear of running afoul of financial sanctions on Russia’s financial system.
*****
&gt; After wild swings both higher and lower, West Texas Intermediate oil futures gained 39% in the first quarter, the eighth positive quarter in a row and its best first quarter since 1999. WTI was just under $100 per barrel Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; # Choppy, volatile market
&gt; Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, said he is constructive on the market heading into the second quarter, but he sees some rough spots ahead.
*****
&gt; “We’ve got to work through the inflation problem, and the Fed catching up to the expectations of the market,” Quinlan said. “We’ve got to re-anchor inflation. It’s going to be a choppy, volatile year. We’re tilting more toward hard assets, whether it’s commodities, energy and natural gas.”
*****
&gt; Quinlan said he leans towards equities over fixed income, which has also been unusually volatile. “We’re using equities as a hedge against inflation,” he said. “Within that framework is more hard assets, fuels, agriculture complex in general and metals and minerals.”
*****
&gt; In the second quarter, the stock market will continue to adjust to an aggressive Federal Reserve against the backdrop of what should have been a solid economy. With 431,000 payrolls added in March, jobs data continues to be strong, but there is a fear the Fed will raise interest rates too quickly, derailing the economy and spinning it into recession.
*****
&gt; Traders in the futures market expect the Fed will increase its fire power at its next meeting in early May, hiking interest rates by 50 basis points, or a half-percent. The Fed’s first rate increase was a quarter-point at its March meeting.
*****
&gt; The market is pricing in the equivalent of eight quarter-point hikes, and Treasury yields have moved higher with stunning speed as market expectations for interest rates shifted. The two-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year yield, or inverted this past week, for the first time since 2019. That is viewed by the market as a warning sign for a recession.
*****
&gt; Fed officials have signaled they want to move to trim the balance sheet soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George this past week said the Fed’s balance sheet will need to decline significantly. She said the Fed’s holdings of Treasurys may have depressed the 10-year yield, causing the yield curve to invert.
*****
&gt; Faranello said interest rates could still head higher on inflation worries, but rates could consolidate after their recent run higher. The yield curve could also remain inverted.
*****
&gt; “We can stay like this for a year-and-a-half. Everyone’s screaming a recession is coming...I don’t think the yield curve is telling us a recession is just about to happen,” Faranello said.

&gt; # Here Comes the Best Month of the Year

&gt; After one of the worst starts to a year ever for stocks, March has seen a huge bounce. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 Index is only about 4% away from new all-time highs. The big question is can the near-term strength continue?

&gt; “The good news is stocks really appear to love April. Not only is it the best month on average since 1950, but it has also been higher an incredible 15 of the past 16 years as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has indeed closed green in April in 15 of the past 16 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blog-3.30.22.png))**

&gt; Taking a deeper look at April reveals that it’s not just the best month for stocks since 1950—it’s also the best month in the past 20 years and the second best month in the past decade. If there is one flaw, it is that in a midterm year it ranks only seventh and is barely positive.

&gt; # Asset Class Performance by Weekday

&gt; As Vladimir Lenin once wrote ""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" For investors, each passing day of late has felt like a month, as Powell's Pivot, the Ukrainian conflict, rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, and COVID have caused rapid shifts in investor sentiment, leading to heightened volatility. With each day feeling like an eternity, we decided to look into the average performance by weekday to provide you with insights into trading patterns based on the day of the week.

&gt; The last twelve months have seen a divergence in performance from the norms of the last 30 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, the S&amp;P 500 has performed poorly on Mondays and Tuesdays before gaining steam from Wednesday through Friday. This diverges from the patterns seen over the last thirty years, in which Thursday and Friday struggled relative to the performance over the first three trading days of the week. This year, oil has averaged gains on every day of the week, but the strongest performance has occurred early in the week, which is interesting as Monday and Tuesday have tended to be the worst days of the week for oil over the last 30 years. Bonds have performed poorly in the beginning of the week over the last twelve months but have partially recovered in the last two trading days. Over the long run, the safe asset has traded narrowly with only Wednesdays averaging a loss. Tuesdays and Thursdays have been strong days for the US Dollar over the last twelve months, but these days tend to result in flat to negative performance when looked at over the last 30 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/SPX-daily-chg-by-WD-032822-2.png))**

&gt; Below we summarize the cumulative performance by weekday for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 30 years. As you can see, Tuesday has been the best performing day by far, booking performance gains of 160.5%. Wednesday has posted a cumulative gain of 83.6%, which lands the day in second place. Friday and Thursday have been the weakest days, booking a cumulative gain of just 27.4% and 28.2%, respectively. Monday lands in the middle, recording a cumulative gain of 41.3%. As outlined above, the recent shift in weekday performance deviates from the norms of the last 30 years as investors have come out of the weekend with fears but concluded the week with optimism.

&gt; # Strong Performance at the Tail Ends of Breadth

&gt; While the index turned lower today on weaker breadth, the recent rally for the S&amp;P 500 has come on strong breadth resulting in the 10-day advance/decline line to surge to some of the highest readings on record. Monday and Tuesday saw 99th percentile readings in the 10-day A/D line and even after the decline today, the current reading remains in the 96th percentile. At Monday's high, the 10-day AD line reached the most elevated level since October 2020. On a sector level, in the past week Financials, Health Care, Materials, Real Estate, and Tech also all saw 99th percentile readings in their own 10-day advance-decline lines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033022-SP-500-AD-Line.png))**

&gt; In the matrix below, we show the average forward performance of the S&amp;P 500 broken down by the percentile range that the index's 10-day AD line is in. Generally, lower readings in the 10-day AD line have been followed by stronger returns whereas higher readings have been followed by weaker returns. That is, except for the most elevated readings. Readings in the upper decile have actually been followed by more consistently positive and stronger than normal average returns for the S&amp;P 500. In other words, strong breadth is typically a more negative signal for the S&amp;P 500 going forward, but an extremely strong breadth reading has actually been positive.

&gt; # Down Q1 Midterm Years &amp; Bear Market Bottoms

&gt; As we enter the last month of the Best Six Months, the market logged its first down quarter in two years since the beginning of the pandemic. Going back to 1930 when our S&amp;P 500 data begins Q1 was positive 55 years and negative 37 times over the 92-year span. Overall, years that advanced in Q1 were up 46 of the 55 years or 83.6% of the time with an average gain of 13.2% for S&amp;P 500. Years when Q1 was down, were positive only 16 of the 37 years or 43.2% of the time for an average loss of -0.1%.

&gt; What jumped out at us were the midterm years that had losing first quarters. In the table we compiled here, the events during these years have an eerie resonance to what’s happening today in 2022. War, conflict, inflation, recession, and rate hikes were common themes in these midterm years. Only three of these 10 midterm years had sizable gains: 1938 (War in Europe), 1942 (WWII) and 1982 (Secular Bull). Losses carried over into Q2 in all but 3 years: 1938, 1942 and 2018. Third quarters rebounded in all but three years: 1966 (Vietnam), 1974 (Oil Embargo/Watergate) and 2002 (Iraq). The only real Q4 blemish was 2018 when the Fed hiked rates too briskly.

&gt; In general, after a down midterm Q1, losses tended to carry over into Q2 and the market began to find its footing in Q3 and rally into Q4. Protracted crises in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 2002 delivered the most negative results though all had significant bear market bottoms. At the Q1 crossroads in 2022 we are faced with similar conditions. Persistent hyperinflation (Jeff’s large iced black coffee is up 29% in the last month from $3.02 to $3.89), a rising rate environment that’s stoking inverted yield curve/recession fears, the brutal war in Ukraine and the new Cold War 2.0 with Russia are threatening a bear market on the backdrop of the heightened volatility we have been warning of since our Annual Forecast in December.

&gt; # Bears Go Back Into Hibernation

&gt; The last couple weeks of the first quarter have seen equities reverse a sizable portion of this year's losses and sentiment has rebounded in sync, though, bullish sentiment turned slightly lower this week in spite of the S&amp;P 500's move higher. From the weekly AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment shed 0.9 percentage points coming in at 31.9%. Even after that decline, the current level of reported optimism remains above all others (outside of last week) since early January, but bullish sentiment still would need to rise another 6 percentage points to move back up to its historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; While more investors are not reporting much optimism, fewer are outright bearish. Bearish sentiment fell for a second week in a row falling another 7.9 percentage points to 27.5%. With a little over a quarter of respondents reporting as bearish, this sentiment reading is at the lowest level since November. That is also now the biggest two-week decline in bearish sentiment (22.3 percentage points) since November 2009 when it had fallen 23.74 percentage points in a two-week span.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note that given bearish sentiment has plummeted at a historic rate without much of an increase in bullish sentiment, neutral sentiment has picked up the difference. That reading clipped above 40% this week for the highest level since January 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/033122-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Other sentiment surveys like the Investors Intelligence one and NAAIM's Exposure Index have also pivoted more bullish this week. As a result, our sentiment composite is close to zero meaning across these three indicators, sentiment is now only just slightly below the historical average.

2129,stocks,"Can anyone show the math behind how much stocks are currently overvalued as a result of fed money printer?

how much money has been printed, and how do you even calculate fair value now? 

I flunked economics class, so I don't understand what happens to the funny money that was printed, and does that funny money just stay in the system? or does it get removed or offset somehow? You see how a lot of stocks were pumped to the sky, and then they pulled the rug. Where did that money go?

Is the fed money printer responsible for a big part of the inflation we're seeing, or is this mostly due to covid shortages?",4
2130,stocks,"hello guys

was looking at a few dividend stocks om the NYSE and LSE.

Just wondering how i can check the dividend history of the stocks? 

do they always pay out the same ratio of earnings, like 50%?

or same quantity of money, like 1 dollar per share every year? 

or my big fear do they pay out as a percentage of their stock price, like 5%? as worried if that the case and stock price halves, means the dividends will half too. 

Where and how do you guys check something like this? 

Is there more i should look at when checking for a dividend stock? 

As goal is to buy enough to get $5000 a year in dividends stably. 

thanks",4
2131,stocks,"We were discussing the other night Warren Buffet's methods of finding a good company and basically sinking a lot of money into that one investment - Buffet's reasoning is that this is less risky than diversification if you have confidence in that company and you know all there is to know about that company and management.

I collar the two tickers yet leaving enough room for the winner of the two to slightly run, and no matter if they hit their targets I'll scalp by the end of the week.

It seems by using common sense to pick out a sector or ETF and their inverse counter part of which those I feel will have some movement insures profit or the likelihood thereof.

&gt; Beijing is preparing to make concessions on the disclosure of some audit information. Regulators are finalizing plans on what financial audit information can and cannot be disclosed abroad, which would provide further clarity on a law that currently prohibits foreign regulators from conducting investigations within China.

What is your take on the sincerity of this change in Chinese government's stance. Why the sudden turnaround? I thought China was eager to bring more of their stocks back to China where they can be better controlled. 

Is this perhaps a sign that a new more liberal group of party officials are now in control (unlikely imo)? Or maybe Chinese government know their economy is about to tank so they're trying to bring in as much foreign investment as possible?

I believe golf related industries, ie. club manufactures, ball manufacturers, merchandising manufacturers and retailers, course maintenance equipment, etc. will grow at an increased rate over the next decade or more. How do I create a portfolio to capitalize on this? I’m curious to hear any suggested companies / allocations, or if any one knows of any funds/ETFs/etc. that focus on golf. 


Justification:
Partially anecdotal, I am seeing and hearing more and more people getting into golf. It seems like everyone and their mother is now all of a sudden interested in playing golf multiple times a month. Additionally, the largest generational bubble since the baby boomers are now reaching the age where they beginning to be interested in the game as a past time / business thing / whatever, and also have the disposable income to spend on this incredibly expensive game. 

As this population ages there will only be an increasing boom in the industry and its interest. We’re already seeing “younger” interest in the game in social spheres such as Barstool Sports, companies like Top Golf are expanding, in home tech like virtual ball tracking/hitting setups are getting more popular.

2145,stocks,"A stock selloff to start 2022 led to the worst quarter in history for a dozen S&amp;P 500 stocks, as investors punished pandemic darlings and highly valued tech companies, subtracting roughly $2 trillion in market cap.

Tech companies took the brunt of a first-quarter selloff that was felt throughout Wall Street, as the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 0.27% lost $1.99 trillion in market cap through Wednesday’s close, its worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data Group. More broad-based indexes also lost more than $1 trillion in market cap but held up better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 0.10% declining by $1.46 trillion.

Dow Jones Market Data Group found 12 stocks that suffered their worst quarterly percentage decline, and roughly half could be considered tech companies: Etsy, PayPal, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms, Keysight Technologies, Match Group and Charter Communications. Others that may not be considered “tech companies” were still harmed by some of the same dynamics that damaged those stocks, however — Xylem, which sells controls technology and other supplies to the water industry, saw its margins slammed by increasing costs of components for those systems.

The 12 stocks combined to lose nearly half a trillion dollars in market cap on their own, a total of $494.19 billion. The bulk of that came from Facebook, which dropped more than $300 billion in valuation as investors chopped off roughly a third of its stock price.

Since yesterday my broker displays it as a 100% return, (due to rounding) - obviously it was an extra day till expiration, but Apple was higher.

Is there any reason why I should wait till expiration instead of closing it right now?

~~In both cases~~ When closing prematurely I will pay a tiny commission (expiration OTM is free). If I wait till expiration I will ""benefit"" from an extra $0.34 of the premium. If I close now, I won't risk any flash crash and it will release my margin so I can sell more puts.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2164,stocks,"REITs (real estate investment trusts) are excellent investments. They are relatively safe and pay relatively high dividends. All REITs are companies that invest in real estate. This could be residential, industrial, retail, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, mortgages, and others. They must pay at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of shareholder dividends each year to qualify as REITs. They are a very safe investment but their dividends are higher than Treasury Bonds, CDS or most stocks. You do have to be a little cautious. The major REITs do not pay dividends as high as some of the lesser REITs. 

I always check Nareit to see which are the best at [https://www.reit.com/investing/reit-directory](https://www.reit.com/investing/reit-directory). Then, I check Yahoo Finance to see how they have done over the past year. Nareit also gives you the dividend yield if you click on the individual stock. The dividend yield is not 90%. The reason for this is that they must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends. The amount that they distribute is based on their taxable income, not their gross income. So, you do need to check to see their dividend yields which, again, can be done at Nariet. Dividend yields can be as low as 2% or as high as 25% to 55%. The higher yields are usually riskier. 

So, I invested $11.90 in RVI in November of 2021. On January 18, 2022, RVI paid me a dividend of $6.54. That is a 55% dividend.

Another stock that I particularly like is NYC. Schwab rated it as an F when I bought it. I didn't buy much of that originally either, $41.00 on September 20, 2021. NYC has only paid me $.50 twice, October 15, 2021 and January 18, 2022 but this REIT has grown well. It is currently almost at its all-time high. If I need to sell a stock for cash, I can do so with this one. 

As we all know, real estate is skyrocketing. This is a good way to cash in on this boom.

I would caution you, as with any stock, don't just jump into REITs. Study carefully so that you know which REITs are a good investment and which aren't. I did give you most of the basics about investing in REITs.

I always keep my eye on what is going on in the U.S. usually by watching the news. An example of how important this can be is that when the pandemic started, retail establishments were closing while data centers were getting a lot more business. So, retail REITs went down while data center REITs went up. It is important to keep track of what is growing and what is losing ground.",4
2165,stocks,"With dividends reinvested, VOO and SCHD have been neck and neck over the past five years with VOO slightly outperforming. Considering that growth has been dominant over the past decade, I was surprised to see this. 

Also considering the fact that we’re potentially in the process of reducing the Fed balance sheet, and raising rates to more normal (as in, pre-‘08 normal) levels, I think value could very well outperform growth over the next 5-10 years.

Another advantage to SCHD is that it will absolutely outperform if we enter into a prolonged bear market (which I think is unlikely but possible), and will have less volatility in any market.

Given all of these advantages to SCHD, as well as the very similar performance
even when growth outperformed value, I think SCHD might be the superior fund.

I’m personally blending my ETF holdings into 70% SCHD/30% QQQ.

Its not that this inversion happened suddenly.

So why stocks feel rapidly at the end of the day for something that everyone knew is coming?

Another example are Chinese stocks. Everyone knows the list of delisting. But the moment Baidu is added on the SEC list it falls 8% in one day, as this were some news that nobody expected

2168,stocks,"Disclaimer: I do not currently hold ANY GameStop stock and haven’t for over a year.

Ok so by now you may know GME is considering a stock split in the form of a *dividend*. We need to take a closer look at why the dividend matters.

In the case of a normal stock split, all shares and positions are split. Even split, no change in value. Essentially everybody gets a smaller slice of the pie but all their slices have the same value—this includes short positions.

Now in the case of a share dividend, let’s say  
Person A - owns 10 shares of GME  
Person B - shorts 10 shares of GME  
Person C - counter-party that buys the 10 shorted shares from Person B  

Person A and Person C technically own the same 10 shares simultaneously. In the case of a dividend split, Person C’s shares will be split and they now own 30. However, Person A’s split shares already went to Person C. So it is *Person B’s responsibility to BUY enough shares to make Person A whole again*. Essentially, this dividend will force shorts hands to cover their position prior to the ex-div date. Very smart by move by RC.

The dividend goes up for a vote by the board on 6/9 lol. 

Special dividend have caused short squeezes in the past, see examples as $OSTK or $BGFV. If you believe that short interest in GME is still high, this could be an interesting play. 

I have no plans to buy GME, but I will be watching closely in the coming months.",4

CARACAS/HOUSTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run energy firm PDVSA is in talks to buy and lease several oil tankers amid a possible expansion in exports, according to three sources and a document seen by Reuters, a sign the country expects U.S. sanctions on its petroleum sector to be eased.

Executives from PDVSA's maritime arm, PDV Marina, and the company's Trade and Supply division recently met with several firms offering tankers. All were willing to take Venezuelan crude or refined products as payment for the vessels, according to the document and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In one of the proposals seen by Reuters, a company whose name was redacted from the document, offered five Aframax tankers, each with the capacity to transport up to 700,000 barrels of oil, under a lease contract with an option to buy them.

It required PDVSA to pay between $22,500 to $35,000 per day for up to 12 months to lease each vessel under a time-charter contract. Those ships would progressively be replaced by new ones after the first year with payment for the new tankers through four million barrels of Venezuelan fuel oil valued at $300 million, according to the proposal.",4

I’ve never done any trading as I am only 20 and I am looking for long term returns. My portfolio is majority VTI as well as 2 other ETFs. Lately though will all the noise in the market around inflation and potential “mini-recession”, I have been researching and looking at some good ETFs to pick up to hedge some of the inflation/poor economy over the next 5 to 8+ years. Today I picked up XLE (Energy sector fund), VNQ (real estate fund) and XLF (financials sector fund). I know Reddit is not going to be my main source of advice but I did want to hear any advice anyone has on here? What do you think some good ETFs would be for the next 3 years?

Also I should mention that I only buy ETFs, I plan on eventually buying individual stocks once I accumulate more capital and am able to focus a bit more time into the market. And lastly, I know the economy could easily recover and inflation may be slowed down significantly, as nobody can predict the market but I am just looking to trade right now based off what I have noticed may happen in the coming 3 years.

The bond market phenomenon means the rate of the 2-year note is now higher than the 10-year note yield.

This part of the yield curve is the most closely watched and typically given the most credence by investors that the economy could be heading for a downturn when it inverts. The 2-year to 10-year spread was last in negative territory in 2019, before pandemic lockdowns sent the global economy into a steep recession in early 2020.

Republicans have criticized him for scolding the U.S. oil industry and pushing for alternative-energy sources even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the world’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Mr. Biden has shifted course recently, including announcing that the U.S. would ship more liquefied natural gas to Europe to help countries there reduce their dependence on Russian gas.

That shift, however, drove concerns among progressives who think the Democratic president is stepping back from his campaign promise to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels. Democrats also have chafed at White House attempts to get authoritarian regimes such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to produce more oil.

A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Biden “wants to do everything possible and sensible to mitigate” the effect of high energy prices on American families.

“He’s been clear in recent remarks that oil and gas companies should help ensure that oil supply meets demand, and at the same time we need to advance clean energy options and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels,” the spokeswoman said.

Decade-high prices and limited spare capacity give Mr. Biden few places to turn aside from oil companies he has shunned as climate polluters and foreign producers with checkered histories, said Samantha Gross, a fellow specializing in climate and energy at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.",4

**GNL -** 10%+ dividend and at least 20-30% upside.

So Global Net leases is a REIT that was trading around $25-$30 pre-pandemic. Pandemic hits and everyone shit their pants because GNL has about 30% expsoure to office buildings, fair. But 2 years later, they have retained 100% of their leases, doubled their net lease duration, and maintained or increased their dividend. Right now trading at around $16/sh with a yield over $10. Like holy fuck how can you NOT invest in this? also, their office exposure is not like the random strip mall office, its HQ of corporations like FedEx, McLaren, Finnair (ok, maybe Putin will fuck the last one up, but their largest client is only 2% of revenue). I mean literally the company would have to lose something like 40% of its revenue base and WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A 7-8% DIVIDEND YIELD.

EDIT: *Note on Debt:* A few people pointed out the high / rising debt. Keep in mind most of this is in mortgages not unsecured or corporate loans (thought they have added some of this recently taking advantage of low interest). So, they buy a property and finance a chunk of it using mortgages, and as they grow of course the debt level will grow. But the debt service coverage ratio is only 3.8x, pretty dang conservative. 

**PSTG** \- 23% Revenue CAGR, solving the world data storage crisis.

Ok, so this one was a Cathy Wood pick and maybe that alone is a reason to avoid it, but she does have some good picks. PSTG provides high efficiency data memory and storage solutions, basically solving the problem of how the hell do you build highly secure, efficient, eco friendly data centers. They offer both cloud storage and hardware for on site.

Anyway, although their stock has been volatile, the company has been quietly crushing it on all financial metrics: revenue, profitability, SaaS growth, economies of scale, etc etc. And compared to other tech stocks at eye watering multiples, these guys are at 4.5x EV / Revenue and about 20x 2023 EBITDA.

Others like Hitachi and Samsung etc are just as shit and burdened with other lines of businesses.

2193,stocks,"Time magazine published its list of 100 most influential companies recently. On the list: Ford Motor and Rivian Automotive, and Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD. 

**Not on the list: Tesla.**

The snub has been noticed by Tesla (ticker: TSLA) bulls. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) portfolio manager Gary Black tweeted out Wednesday evening: “Very sus.” That is short for suspect.

He has a point. Like it or not, Tesla is the world’s most valuable car maker by a very wide margin. The company has ushered in the era of electric vehicles, and its strategy has been either praised or emulated by global auto makers ranging from Volkswagen (VOW3.Germany) to General Motors (GM).

All the U.S. companies that achieved trillion dollar market caps made it on the list: Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com. 

Still, Time seems to acknowledge the importance of the car business, with three auto makers on the list. Cars, after all, generate trillions in annual economic activity while employing millions around the globe. Vehicles also account for roughly 15% of all global carbon-dioxide emission. Carbon dioxide is the atmosphere’s greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. About Ford, which the magazine lists in the Titans category, Time notes the company is going all out to electrify its products. That is true. Ford has announced billions in spending for EV assembly and battery capacity. The company plans to have enough capacity to manufacture two million EVs by 2026.

BYD isn’t a household name, but it is one of the five most valuable auto makers on the planet, making cars, buses, and batteries. Tesla actually shows up in BYD’s write-up as a competitor in China.

BYD is in the Titans category with Ford. Rivian (RIVN) is in the innovator category. Time detailed Rivian’s struggles to ramp up production, which is probably the number one thing investors are watching in 2022. Rivian plans to make about 25,000 vehicles in 2022. At the start of the year, Wall Street was hoping for about 40,000. Rivian stock has suffered due to that disappointment. Coming into Thursday trading, shares are down about 50% year to date, far worse than the 3% comparable drops of both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, and worse than the 4% year-to-date gain in Tesla stock.

Time, of course, has significantly acknowledged Tesla recently. Elon Musk was its “Person of the Year” in 2021. Musk has also appeared on Barron’s list of best CEOs for the past two years. Barron’s recognized his disruption in two businesses—cars and rockets. Musk also runs SpaceX, the company that pioneered reusable rockets and that now owns about two-thirds of all the satellites orbiting earth. (AZMN), Meta Platforms (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL). Just not Tesla.

SpaceX, in private markets, is valued at roughly $100 billion. That is more than either Ford or Rivian, and roughly the same as aerospace giant Boeing (BA). SpaceX didn’t make Time’s list either. Axiom Space did though. It’s building a commercial space station. So did Astroscale. It’s a company dedicated to cleaning up space junk. In the end, lists exist partly to get people talking. This one certainly will.

# [Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed as Wall Street gets set to end a wild quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in early morning trading Thursday as traders wrap up a month and quarter.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 26 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Some tech stocks were under pressure Thursday amid analysts concerns over the PC market going forward. AMD shares slipped more than 1% in the premarket after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight. Meanwhile, HP Inc and Dell dipped 3.8% and 2%, respectively, after being downgraded to equal weight from overweight at Morgan Stanley.
*****
&gt; Oil prices fell sharply, with West Texas Intermediate futures dropping 5% to $102.18 per barrel. That comes as President Joe Biden’s administration considers a plan to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the strategic petroleum reserve for about six months, a source told NBC News.
*****
&gt; Volatile oil prices have loomed over equities, with U.S. crude prices climbing more than 3% on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia, and U.S. crude stockpiles fell.
*****
&gt; “We’re going to be bouncing around between good news and bad news, unfortunately,” said George Mateyo, Key Private Bank chief investment officer. “That’s going to create some volatility.”
*****
&gt; Thursday marks the last trading day of March and of the first quarter.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace to finish the month up about 5% each, while the Dow is nearly 4% higher in March. For the first quarter, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down about 3% and the Nasdaq is off more than 7%.
*****
&gt; Those moves come as traders grapple with the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy this year to fight a spike in U.S. inflation, while the Ukraine-Russia war rages on.
*****
&gt; Investors are awaiting weekly jobless claims and personal income and spending data to be released Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a down session Wednesday in which the Dow and S&amp;P 500 each snapped four-day win streaks. The Dow shed 65.38 points, or 0.2%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%.

2201,stocks,"I am all in.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory/?utm_campaign=mb&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morning_brew

I have serious doubts as to the competence of FB’s Zuckerberg. It is clear that Zuckerberg has no creative innovative plays in his pocket. Instagram was an app developed by someone not affiliated with FB, which FB purchased and ran with. IG Stories was a concept stolen from Snap, Inc. IG Reels was a concept stolen from TikTok. FaceBook is decaying. The metaverse is a speculative play principally enabled by corporations (think Dolce and Gabbana, Tommy, Forever 21).

Having said this, I give credence to what Professor Damodaran has said ( https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2022/02/back-to-earth-or-temporary-setback.html?m=1 ) about FB being massively cheap right now. I would purchase FB if in the next one or two financial statements they report attractive net income.

Disclaimer: I own SNAP.",4
2202,stocks,"I just read the ""The little book that beats the market"" by Joel Greenblat and wanted to see if anyone in this sub is employeeing or has employeed the investment strategy suggested in the book. 

The idea stipulated is quite simple: ""buy good companies at a bargain"". While the logic seems sound the execution suggested is even simpler which I will try to summarize below for anyone who is interested.

The main point of this strategy is that it only works if applied in a long period of time, aka 5 years +. The author presents a case that this strategy has consistently beaten the average market results for the past 17 years and thinking about the logic he is employeeing it sounds rational. 

The main caveat for me is the application of the formula and how consistent one can be when applying it to actual numbers, so that's why I wanted to ask if anyone around here has read/used/is using the suggested method and what are your thoughts.

Also if you have used the method what were the sources you employed did you do your own research or did you use sources presented in the book.

Here is a brief summary of the strategy:

1. Look for good comapnies by selecting businesses with a high return on capital, the simple formula here is EBIT/(net working capital + net fixed assets). 

2. Look for businesses with a high earning yield, the simple formula here is EBIT/EV (enterprise value).

3. Rank potential companies according to these two criteria, add those critiria to recieve your final ranking and select the best 20 - 30 companies. Hold them for a year, afterwords sell and repeat. 

That's pretty much it. I did cut some corners to briefly explain the idea of course, the book goes into slighlty more detail and gives an explanation to why theses specific inputs are used, but nevertheless the idea stands: good companies at a bargain.

Once more I'd love to hear your thoughts.",4

Have been buying quantities of VTI at various times over the last while

Sold it all on March 7th as I wasn't sure how much more it was going to drop. Sell price was $213.21 per share

Bought back in on March 18th for $225.27 per share, and this triggered a wash sale

So even though I bought back in at $225.27 per share, it now shows my cost basis on those shares as $238 / share because of the wash sale.

So to clear the wash sale, I have to sell it all again when it's above $225.27? Or when it's above $238??

10-year trendlines:  SWK is currently 2 StDev below its linear and exponential 10-year growth trends, with 2 StDev at approximately 143.20 (my entry point).  Its current downward deviation from trend is its largest downward deviation in 10 years, other than the COVID crash.

&amp;#x200B;

PE Ratio:  Current PE ratio of 14.89 is the lowest PE in 10 years, other than the COVID crash.  2 StDev from mean is 14.33, so it's basically within buying range.

200-weekly MA deviation:  currently at -7% below the 200wMA, after the recent runup.  It was at -12%, which was the largest downward deviation from the 200wMA since the COVID crash.  The largest before was -9%, so this is still within buying range.

As title says, unless my parents house burn down I can invest around 800$ every month (social welfare). It's actually 1000$, but I have to deduct charges (food, gas and bike insurance) out of it.

I have absolutely no idea what to do, barely know anything about banking as well. What's a safe placement to do ? I saw people talking about VTI/SPY being a safe profit in the long-run, google only says its value kept rising (overall) every year.

If so, what am I supposed to do ? Find a bank in my country that allows to buy stocks, and split the 800$ on these two things ? Or do something completely different, even unrelated to the subreddit ?

Thanks in advance!

PS : I live in Europe if that changes anything ?

2231,stocks,"We’re nearing the end of a pretty nasty downtrend trend for Rocket Companies (RKT), but it may be time to consider buying in at these levels for a long position. I’d love feedback on my thesis below.

It’s no secret that the stock has struggled in the face of raising interest rates to combat inflation. It’s been looming over the stock since early 2021 (aside from when it meme’d). Now that we have a little more clarity from the FED on what we’re dealing with and how we’re gonna handle it, the next few years may actually be favorable for Rocket even if on the surface, they’ll be making less money than they did during the pandemic. 

I believe the competition will be way more affected by higher interest rates than RKT. This is a reality that all mortgage companies have to deal with. But RKT has deep pockets along with more diversification into other revenue streams to wait out slower periods. I believe there will be more consolidation in the mortgage industry in the next few years (we’re already seeking it with moves like Better.com, look that up if you haven’t seen that mess) and it’ll only help RKT obtain more market share. 

The execs at RKT have also been very savvy with acquisitions to grow their platform outside the traditional mortgage route. I predicted that they’d start acquiring companies about 3 months ago (see post history) and they bought Truebill (a 1.275 billion all cash deal) a few weeks after my post. They’re funneling tons of cash into advertising this app. I see adds EVERYWHERE for it (youtube ads, public transit, etc) and it’s a brilliant way to get users in the door/into the ecosystem for more service offerings. The user base growth is a story no one seems to be talking about. It will be key in the long run as they strive to obtain the most market share. I expect another major acquisition to be done by the end of 2022 at the latest. Jay Farner (CEO) stated that they’d be very aggressive this year to acquire companies as they become more appealing to buy with everything coming down from pandemic highs. 

And the cherry on top, Jay also stated that he plans to buy $36 million of his own stock throughout the year of 2022. The stock price of 10-11 seems to be an established floor with the worst news already known and behind us. The upside heavily outweighs any risks that I see but I’d love to hear any *constructive* negative theories that you may have (especially at these prices).

Position, 3600ish shares (dividend $ recently reinvested back into the stock, rounding) @ a 17 average. I’ll be buying calls soon as well. Preparing to buy call leaps by the end of the week. I expect this to be a 20 stock by 2023.",4

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 30, 2022 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- To drive significantly greater productivity and efficiency for increasingly complex chip designs, [Synopsys, Inc](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3488542-1&amp;h=1651473269&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.synopsys.com%2F&amp;a=Synopsys%2C+Inc). (Nasdaq: [SNPS](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3488542-1&amp;h=26892142&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.synopsys.com%2Fcompany%2Finvestor-relations.html&amp;a=SNPS)) today announced a new cloud-optimized electronic design automation (EDA) deployment model that delivers unparalleled levels of chip and system design flexibility via a single-source, pay-as-you-go approach. Synopsys Cloud provides access to the company's cloud-optimized design and verification products, with pre-optimized infrastructure on Microsoft Azure to address higher levels of interdependencies in chip development.  

""Semiconductor companies are increasingly challenged to quickly deliver both complex functionality and energy efficiency to meet growing requirements for more compute,"" said Mark Papermaster, executive vice president and CTO, AMD. ""AMD is delivering high-performance processors across a wide range of workloads. Innovative approaches like Synopsys Cloud built on the Microsoft Azure HBv3 cloud platform – now powered by the latest 3rd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors with 3D V-Cache™ technology – can provide access to optimized compute and EDA tools in the cloud, further adding to our innovative chip design capabilities.""

**Flexibility to Address Dynamic Chip Design and Verification Workloads**

Chip development in the cloud represents a way forward for an industry grappling with exploding computational demands along with continued time-to-market pressure. From innovative design houses to large systems companies to small startups, more chipmakers are migrating workloads to the cloud to take full advantage of the faster time-to-results, enhanced quality-of-results and better cost-of-results that cloud-based design and verification technologies provide. It has, however, become more challenging to forecast compute needs, leading engineers to underestimate the compute and EDA resources they need while experiencing growing systemic complexity.

**Collaboration with Microsoft Azure to Enhance Chip Development with SaaS Approach**

In recent years, chip development teams began leveraging a ""bring your own cloud"" (BYOC) approach offered by Synopsys and other EDA vendors, where chip development teams are required to source compute infrastructure from public cloud service providers and are frequently constrained by pre-defined design and verification capacity. Synopsys is working closely with its preferred cloud partner, Microsoft, to transform the landscape through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) chip development solution on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. With the SaaS approach, customers can directly access and pay as they go for cloud compute resources and for any Synopsys cloud-enabled design and verification product.

Customers who already have cloud resources through a BYOC model can also take advantage of Synopsys Cloud and its pay-per-use cloud-enabled EDA tools. The collaboration with Microsoft Azure will enable design teams to benefit from flexibility and faster time-to-market, addressing today's systemic complexities in chip design and verification. [Read more](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3488542-1&amp;h=824083799&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Faccelerate-silicon-design-innovation-on-azure-with-synopsys-cloud&amp;a=Read+more) from Microsoft about this collaboration and its benefits.

**Streamlining the Foundry Collateral Process**

Synopsys is working together with major foundries to streamline access to required manufacturing collateral for use with its cloud-optimized products. The roadmap for the collaboration aims to provide customers with a flexible, cloud-optimized approach for accessing and managing foundry collateral.

""Our new Synopsys Cloud offering promises to be transformative, providing designers the ability to scale up or down in response to their dynamic chip design and verification needs,"" said Sassine Ghazi, president and chief operating officer at Synopsys. ""As more design flows incorporate AI, requiring even more resources, the virtually unlimited compute and EDA access we're providing will lay the foundation for new levels of semiconductor innovation while delivering a flexible, secure chip development environment for future demands.""

Rani Borkar, Corporate Vice President, Azure Hardware Systems &amp; Infrastructure at Microsoft added, ""Addressing systemic complexity along with interdependent design flows in chip design requires more compute and EDA resources than ever before. Microsoft Azure continues to scale its high-performance computing infrastructure with the availability, affordability and capacity to handle advanced chip design and verification workloads. The Synopsys Cloud software-as-a-service solution has been purpose-built on Microsoft Azure for EDA workloads, delivering a flexible design and verification environment to foster the productivity that design teams need.""",4

*****
&gt; U.S. equities futures dipped slightly Wednesday after stocks extended their rally in the previous session, even as fears of an inverted yield curve sparked recession concerns and investors continued watching developments play out in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 95 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Russia said late Tuesday it would reduce its military presence in some parts of Ukraine, but several countries — including the U.S. and U.K. — remain skeptical over Moscow’s pledge. Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine continued Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Crude prices, which have soared since the war began, climbed more than 2% to $106.57 per barrel on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 positing their fourth straight day of gains on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8% in the previous session and now sits less than 10% from its record.
*****
&gt; “The market’s now up almost 10% in the last 10 days, so we’ve had a pretty incredible rally in a very short time with not a whole lot of news change except that we actually have more rate hikes priced into the market,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC.
*****
&gt; “This has been a nice ride,” she added. “But I wouldn’t get too comfortable for the rest of this year, because I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of volatility.”
*****
&gt; Several retail stocks were under pressure in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly reports, including Five Below and Chewy.
*****
&gt; On the positive side, shares of chipmaker Micron rose 4% after the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Apparel stock Lululemon jumped 7% after issuing upbeat guidance and announcing a share buyback program.
*****
&gt; All eyes were on the bond market Tuesday as the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted Monday for the first time since 2016. Historically, this inversion has been a sign of a coming recession, though it hasn’t been a good indicator of when the recession would come. Still, investors largely shrugged off the event.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the main yield spread traders watch, that between the 2-year and the 10-year rate, came close to inverting but stayed positive. On Wednesday, the spread climbed back to about 7 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The big talk right now is that at any given point in time, recession can be on the horizon,” Lang said. “Typically, you won’t see a recession for an average of 20 months once a yield curve inverts. Our antennas are up that recession risk is heightened; that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’ll be one this year, though next year is more of a concern for us.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching economic data scheduled to be released Wednesday, including economic growth data, home sales data and ADP’s national employment report.

2241,stocks,"Companies added jobs at a solid pace in March,  indicating that hiring is strong despite signs of a tightening labor  market, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.

Private  payrolls expanded by 455,000 for the month, the firm said, about in line  with the Dow Jones estimate of 450,000 though it was the lowest since  August 2021. The total was slightly below the upwardly revised 486,000  in February, and brought ADP’s first-quarter jobs count to 1.45 million.

The  report comes two days before the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls  report, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics expected to show jobs growth  of 490,000 for the month, according to the Dow Jones consensus  estimate. The ADP and BLS numbers can differ widely, as they did in  February when the payrolls firm’s count was about 200,000 below the  government’s official tally.

ADP’s report for March indicated that  hiring was spread evenly around sectors, with leisure and hospitality  adding 166,000 to lead the way. Education and health services  contributed 72,000 while professional and business services was next  with 61,000 new jobs.

On the goods-producing side, manufacturing led with 54,000 while construction added 15,000.

Service-providing companies added 377,000 jobs while goods producers made up the balance of about 79,000.

By  size, job gains also were spread fairly evenly, with companies  employing 50 to 499 workers up 188,000 and large companies adding  177,000. Small business, which saw a decline in February, reversed that  and added 90,000 in March.

“Businesses  are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most  ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” said Nela Richardson,  chief economist at ADP. “However, a tight labor supply remains an  obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”

Indeed, in February there were [a record 5 million more jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/there-are-now-a-record-5-million-more-job-openings-than-unemployed-people-in-the-us.html)  than available workers, according to BLS data released Wednesday.  Workers continue to leave their jobs in search of better opportunities,  with 4.3 million more taking part in the so-called Great Resignation  during the month.

Friday’s report is expected to show the unemployment rate contracted further, to 3.7%.

Federal  Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as the central  bank battles inflation at 40-year highs. Job growth has come with a  sharp acceleration in wages, and the Fed is expected to raise interest  rates at a brisk pace this year to combat rising prices.

Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a net worth of between $41 million and $119 million.

Gensler, who was previously chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., disclosed the figures in a form filed with the Office of Government Ethics, as part of the confirmation process. Income and assets are disclosed in ranges on the form.

His biggest holding, of between $25 million and $50 million, was in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.

Gensler also said he had $50,001 to $100,000 in capital gains from his holding of Tesla Inc. shares, the only individual stock that’s listed. That asset is now fully divested, according to the filing.

Gensler said he participates in the defined benefit plan at Goldman, where he was a partner earlier in his career. He said the retirement plan is expected to pay out $977 per month starting at age 71.

Dow Jones reported some of the figures from the filing earlier Friday.

Much of Gensler’s money comes from his years at Goldman, which he joined in the late 1970s out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. His mentor was Robert Rubin, who rose to vice chairman of the firm before becoming Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. Gensler had stints trading stocks and bonds, and also worked on the mergers-and-acquisition team. Eventually he became one of the youngest partners in the firm’s history.",4

I was looking for major insider buys, and I stumbled across something very interesting. After two years of constant insider selling, the company director, Robert Gervis, made a $4.5M purchase of company stock last week.

So why would the company director buy stock in a company with shitty fundamentals?Aerogels are usually used in the oil industry and rocket ships, but when you go to Aspen's company website, they had a product that stuck out to me. They have a special aerogel made for insulating the batteries on EVs called Pyrothin. Accroding to the website its ""Starting at only 2mm thickness, our [**thermal runaway barriers**](https://www.aerogel.com/industries/battery-thermal-barriers/) can be tailored to perform in critical applications, including:

* Cell-to-cell thermal runaway propagation
* Battery pack and module barriers""

Now, if you live in the midwest, you probably know that EV's are bad here, the cold weather reduces battery life in the winter, and the hot summers damage the battery. Owning an EV here is an expensive money pit, and you'd save more time and money driving a BMW on our salt covered roads. Aerogels are great insulators, and if applied to a lithium battery, it would stop the batteries from A) starting fires, and B) make the battery life last longer and keep more consistent range.

On top of that, if you go to their investor page, the company CEO had some comments on their Pyrothin Aerogel:

Mr. Young commented, ""We are projecting solid revenue growth in each of our principal markets during 2022, including a tripling of our EV thermal barrier revenue to $20.0 million for the year. We are also increasing our investment levels during the year to keep pace with our rapidly growing e-mobility opportunities. This investment will be focused on establishing an automated fabrication operation in Mexico and enhancing the technical, commercial and operational teams and associated resources supporting our thermal barrier and carbon aerogel battery materials businesses.""

Mr. Young continued, ""While these planned investments will expand our Adjusted EBITDA loss and net loss in 2022 versus 2021, they position us for strong growth in revenue and profitability through the decade. Based on customer forecasts and our thermal barrier quoting activity, we are targeting to double our revenue to nearly $240 million by 2023 and to triple revenue from that level by 2025; and have the opportunity to deliver strong revenue growth thereafter through the decade with continued growth in demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers, the strong potential of our Aspen Battery Materials business and with other new business opportunities created by leveraging our Aerogel Technology PlatformTM.""

Now, I don't know for sure if GM will be that contractor, but it seems pretty likely. GM has said that it wants to produce 30 new EV cars by 2025, and wants to go all electric by 2035. On top of this, I think GM has already done some business with ASPN, and even named them one of their 2021 Overdrive award winners. GM is also planning to make fully electric Equinoxes, Silverados, and Blazers in 2023, and if you don't know, those are pretty much the only cars people buy from GM in the midwest, and if they can make these cars have a usable range and battery lilfe, people here are gonna buy these up.

2261,stocks,"\- Russia and Belarus account for 37.6% of 2019 potash production. It's been sanctioned by the largest economies in the world. China was another 10% of the market and they are severely limiting and banning exports on fertilizer.

\- Potash fertilizer is irreplaceable. Using more nitrogen or phosphate won't help. All of these fertilizers do their own unique things to support crop growth. Potash is actually known to be good for water absorption, drought protection and generating protein.

\- Saskatchewan, Canada is a major producer and thankfully is friendly with USA, but they have something called ""Canpotex"" (Canadian Potash Exporters) which controls all of their potash supply - you should think of Canpotex like its OPEC (oil). It's organized as a cartel. They share the same rail infrastructure, they hold back supply of potash (""spare capacity"") to keep prices higher. It's just TWO companies! Nutrien (""NTR"") and Moaic Company (""MOS""). If you've never heard of Nutrien, some of you people that have been paying attention for a few years might recognize Potash Corp of Saskatckewan and Agrium -- Nutrien is the combined company. They control the vast majority of potash mining supply in the only major potash ore bed in the world that isn't sanctioned.

\- I've followed this industry for 15 years. BHP tried to buy Potash Corp of Sask. in 2010, but Canada blocked it b/c potash was too strategically important. I have a friend whose wife worked at one of these companies and they were all celebrating in 2006 when a Russian potash mine flooded, and in 2014 when a massive pothole formed from a Russian potash mine that became ruined (google search the image...you might remember this from 2014). Those were just single mines, and now all of it is off the market. That's 37.6% of 2019 global production. For comparison, Russia is only 11% of global oil production and Belarus isn't an oil producer.

\- This is serious business. In crazy Russian drama, in August 2013, the CEO of Uralkali (Russia potash), he was detained at an airport in Minsk, Belarus and thrown in jail for 14 months for breaking up the Belarusian Potash Cartel in June 2013. Look it up, its a crazy story. Belarus normally gets along with Russia but this seriously pissed them off!! If you look up the dictator Alexander Lukashenko, this would make sense...that man is way crazier than Trump.

\- Their phones in Saskatoon are ringing off the hook right now. The world really needs more potash or else crop yields will be a lot lower without this essential crop fertilizer. Especially from countries worried about doughts from climate change b/c potash is good for water absorption to help plants grow.

\- NTR, MOS and IPI are the plays. IPI is the higher cost producer in America with more beta to potash prices. Think of IPI in USA like this: NTR/MOS are the Saudi Arabia of oil (they own the the most production, massive, low cost mines from the best reserves on the planet), and IPI is the oil frackers in USA...higher cost that feels pain downturns but is en fuego in bull markets. So if you look at these stocks and wonder why IPI is more volatile/higher beta, that is why.",4

Then alternative is selling to soon. I get my 5-7% sell out thinking profits are profits don’t be greedy, then the ticker proceeds to go 10% + percent higher. Recently did this with IUSG. Sold at 104  from 95ish now it looks like it’s going at least over 110 in the face of nothing but bad news in the world and markets…

Idk if I’m watching these to much or what to emotional maybe.

Like what Amazon did in 2020 I think.

Edit: so when the split changes the stock price from 1000$ (which I cannot afford) to 100$. I cannot earn money from buying 5x100$ stocks, and waiting for it to go up? I don’t understand why it’s a bad idea to buy like 5 stocks more?",4

We could see the highest daily volume today that we've seen in weeks. There is some overhead resistance at the 50 DMA around $11.00, but this is a low risk entry point in my opinion. I started a position in January at $13.17 so I'm looking to add here.

2) DKNG - Very similar pattern to SOFI but today's breakout action is even more bullish. Very large candle making a new high and poking above the 50 DMA.

The offer is to ""upon first day of employment, propose to the board to award X# of common stocks"". The folks that I'm talking to were there before last funding, so maybe their strike price is lower than what I would get. Doesn't that line up?

New to this, but my understanding is that strike prices are usually equal to the FMV of the company's stock on the day the option is granted. This is a pre-IPO company, so private for now. Headed into another funding session. 

How far off am I on being concerned? Would a company simply give you $k worth of stock with value above the gift value or is it always you get it at face value and you reap what you sow in the value improvements? I'm under the impression I'll have 300% of the strike cost kind of built-in (obviously with the risk that come with start-ups).

Here’s my understanding, please correct me if I’m wrong:

1. Bad - Neon shortage is a problem because a large proportion of industrial-grade neon is produced by Russia and Ukraine.
2. Good / neutral - However, China is also a major producer of neon so we need not worry about the shortage of neon -&gt; halt production in chips -&gt; bringing modern world to a halt as there will be no production of any equipment that requires chips (TV, fans, phones, cars, computers, printers, medical equipments, etc). Politics may result in some bargaining and this may help resolve some of the shortage
3. Bad - TSMC only has 6 months of neon supply, thereafter we can expect the world to feel the impact of chip shortage due to lack of material (this is different from the ongoing shortage due to production capability, which can be addressed with time and building more plants. This shortage will cause more severe impact.)
4. Bad - AMD is a major client so it will be affected too since it cannot produce irs own chips.

I was thinking perhaps some European oil stocks would rise because it's pretty clear we won't be depending on Russian gas anymore, but those stocks already went up when the sanctions-hit Russian gas providers.

Let's discuss",4
2281,stocks,"First, anyone who thinks Putin/anyone close to Putin can be trusted does not know the basic history of Putin. Putin was the same man who said he was simply lining up his military along the border of Ukraine for ""military testing"". The ""peace"" talks going one way or another are supremely irrelevant. Putin wants Ukraine - all of it. He will never surrender - he is a sociopath. 

Second, the main reason oil collapsed down from the $135 level back down to where it is now is because of the strict China COVID lockdowns. These will probably follow a similar pattern as in 2020 (2 large spikes within a month, then a drastic scaling back and much lower COVID numbers reported). I would say around the beginning to mid April oil prices will begin to soar again. I originally thought oil would hit $150 by late this month. China COVID coming out of nowhere made this not happen (and I am glad, truly do not want oil to soar). 

Third, and the main reason for this post. The fun is going to come to a nasty stall folks pretty soon. Come around mid April when COVID lockdowns ease in China, and the traveling begins in the USA oil is going to go parabolic, much more aggressively than what we saw in the past month. Oil could easily jump from say $100 to $180 within a month. Nothing will stop it in that short period. 

**The best thing a reddit investor can do is the following: Sell what you believe will go red when this happens (everything besides oil). I am going to load up on even more UVXY. As well as USO, along with CVX. It would likewise be wise to stock your portfolio with GLD as a nice hedge for the storm to come.** 

I honestly hope I am wrong. I hope I wake up one of these days and see Putin being tried for crimes against humanity and a total peace in Ukraine. That is just not going to happen however. As an investor, the above protects your assets. Once again - hoping I am wrong - hoping to see the pictures and videos of the innocent in Ukraine being able to rebuild normalcy somehow and Putin being tried for war crimes.",4

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning, putting the major averages on track to build on the previous session’s gains, as traders awaited key economic data.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 139 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Consumer confidence and home price data to be released Tuesday, ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report. Economists expect to see 460,000 jobs added in March and the unemployment rate to fall to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones estimates.
*****
&gt; Traders are also monitoring the latest developments in the Ukraine-Russia war, as peace talks get under way in Turkey. To be sure, both sides have said they are not close to reaching a deal. Ahead of the negotiations, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on that “nothing is agreed upon unless everything is agreed upon.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the U.K. warned that Russian troops still pose a “significant threat” to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, noting that Russia is reorganizing its forces.
*****
&gt; In fixed income, the 5-year Treasury note rose above the 30-year on Monday and held there on Tuesday, marking the first inversion since 2006. The shift stoked some recession fears, although economists typically watch the spread between the 2-year and 10-year rate, which remains positive.
*****
&gt; “Our base case is that the US economy can avoid a recession, lowering the threat of a sustained downtrend in stocks. As such, investors should brace for higher rates—including potentially adding exposure to value and financial stocks which tend to outperform as central bank policy tightens—without overreacting by exiting equity markets,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 rose 94.65 points and 0.7%, respectively, to notch three-day winning streaks. The Nasdaq was the big outperformer, jumping 1.3%.

2290,stocks,"I especially do this with every company that has had an IPO within past 3-5 years as you can usually find something hidden on it.

Here's an example from TOST 10K report. [Page 121](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016422000009/tost-20211231.htm) says this:

&gt;In consideration for the acquisition of xtraCHEF, we issued 569,400 shares of common stock to the seller shareholders with a fair value of $26.10 per share on the acquisition date supported by a contemporaneous valuation.

They acquired xtraCHEF on June 8th 2021.

TOST IPO price was $55 on Sep. 24th 2021.

That's an increase in share price of around 115%\~ in just 3 months. How can a companies intrinsic value increase by more than double in 3 months? Well... it simple cannot. This means either management (or the third party appraiser, not sure who valued it exactly) valued their stock too low on the aquistion of xtraChef OR it means the IPO price of $55 is grossly overvalued... Now I'll let you decide which one is the obvious answer here :)

TOST has a fair value (according to their own management or a third party appraisal) of around $26.10 today.

TOST value today is $19. Insiders have been recently buying. A combination of these signs mean that the stock (even without my own DCF) is probably undervalued at today's price.

Always always try and look for what management thinks their own fair value of stock in the annual reports.

Usually you can find some type of acquisition like this or similar. I found the same thing in RobinHood where management believe the fair value of $HOOD is around $16.

Simple things like this can guide you towards the true value and stop you from overpaying.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2293,stocks,"The Justice Department Monday endorsed legislation forbidding large digital platforms such as Amazon and Google from favoring their own products and services over competitors’, marking the Biden administration’s first full-throated support of the antitrust measure.

“The Department views the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition, with risks for consumers, businesses, innovation, resiliency, global competitiveness, and our democracy,” says a letter to bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, signed by Peter Hyun, the Justice Department’s acting assistant attorney general for legislative affairs.

The letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, expresses support for the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which the Senate’s judiciary panel approved in January in a bipartisan vote, as well as similar legislation moving through the House.

AAPL, +0.50% and others oppose the proposed legislation, saying it would make it harder to offer popular services. The bills’ opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations’ popularity.

The department’s letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms’ dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms’ conduct would carry significant benefits. 

“Discriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,” the letter says.

2294,stocks,"Hello. I'm from Turkey and if you follow the news regarding our country lately we have a hyperinflation-ish situation (which is still going on) in our country and a FX crisis (peaked 3 months ago but the fundamental risk still exists). In addition we have a huge boom in housing prices especially in Istanbul, which is where I'd like to buy a house. Real estate prices increased %20 in USD terms, whereas my salary is down like  %5 in USD terms (and I'm actually very lucky compared to the most of the other employees who didn't get this much of a salary raise since I got a %85 raise in TRY terms). So, in short, things are not looking good both for the time being and for the future..


As I said above I have an intention to buy a house in Istanbul but for this to happen, first I need to sell another house in a minor city where the real estate prices didn't increase much compared to Istanbul. So I don't know when will this sale happen and thus I'd like to invest my current cash position in a valuable stock which will perform relatively well for at least upcoming 12 months. When I looked into it, $BRK.B looked like an obvious choice for that kind of investment but I'd like to get your opinion on this. Based on the fundamentals, the company seems quite a bit undervalued right now. However on the other hand, it is currently in it's (almost) ATH price and the last analyst expectation for its price was $364, so it seems there's not much room left for the potential growth from that perspective. I personally believe in Uncle Warren and I heard that he bought some oil companies a while ago so even if we have an inflationary period of time for the upcoming 12 month, BRK.B might perform relatively well compared to the rest of the market, but overall do you think is it (still) a good time to buy this share at  the moment?",4

Folks, I watched ETF Edge today and discovered that FINRA is considering additional rules on leverage products (calling them ""complex products""). One of the things they are suggesting is to add a test exam for Retail Investors as a way to make sure that they understand risks that come with Leverage. They might even go one step further to enforce 1 day buy-n-hold limit trading limit for Retail investors. I personally disagree with this and before conventional financial advisors fill it up with ""yes, we need more regulation"" to serve their own interest, I want to bring this to your attention. The FINRA notice is currently seeking comments from the public, on what they think should be done and whether current oversight is enough.

2302,stocks,"Hi guys. 25m here, with very little experience in buying/trading stocks and wanted to get some advice from y'all.

I live in the EU. One day at work I received a call from a UK survey asking general questions about my job position and what I invest in (which has only been crypto up until now). I indulged the nice lady and that was that... Or so I thought...

A month later I got a call from a broker called Ability corporate advisory. Who are based out of Hong Kong and I believe have some sort of set up in Singapore. They got my details from the survey people of course, and so began the back and forth between me and this guy.

The proposal is a 5000euro purchase amount of stock what he called institutional prices? (as in less than what the banks would give them to you for, if I am using the term right), and they take 1% in and out of the transaction with an estimated 90day turn around with projected profits of 47%.

I guess what I am really wondering is whether this broker is legit, as in whether anybody has heard of them? They have a well laid out website and a company registration in Hong Kong, but there is pretty much nothing else about them online.

If you haven't heard of them is there any easy way to tell if I am being scammed? Or even what they would have to provide me with on stock purchase?

Sorry I my message seems like it jumps around a bit. Its late here atm and I needed to get this off my mind.

2306,stocks,"So I know about dollar cost averaging and it’s kind of unavoidable. But instead of doing that, why don’t you just get maybe 25 stocks and some ETFs. Then instead of just putting in no matter the price, you only put in at good buy prices. 
My logic is that with that many stocks there is always going to be some around good buy prices. So you invest in those ones. I guess you can dollar cost average the ETFs and some specific stocks like google and Amazon etc. But the rest, can’t I just invest like that? 

You obviously need to figure out good prices however. Some stocks may not enter those price ranges for a long time. I might sit on cash too long or over expose myself to a stock I thought was cheap but actually wasn’t. 

Anyway, hopefully someone understands what I mean. Anyone do this or is there a name for it?",4

2308,stocks,"PSA. If you are up on a stock, consider locking in some profit. If you don’t, remember there is risk to holding anything. There are lots of volatile stocks moving very quickly in this market. You can see vey fast gains, and also fast losses. Everyone should keep their own goals and risk tolerances in mind but it can be easy to let hype or fomo get to you. So for anyone who needs to hear it, taking profits is a safe and reasonable strategy. Things that went up sharply very well may correct (as we saw with many tickets this year).  You haven’t actually made money until you sell, so think about if it makes sense to take profits, to rebalance or if your current holdings still fit your goals and risk tolerances. 

Good luck out there everyone

2316,stocks,"The new billionaire tax proposal would levy a 20% minimum tax on households worth $100MM or more, and it would tax unrealized gains.  There's a scenario that is far more common than the Musk or Bezos scenario, and it has bad implications for people who aren't really *that* rich.  It could possibly even wipe them out.

Let's say you are a business owner, and your business is quickly growing.  It's privately held, and you get to the point where you are netting $5-6 million per year.  In some industries, business valuation multipliers are high enough that this would value your business at $100MM, thus qualifying you for the ""billionaire tax"" since you own the whole pie.

Your unrealized gain is $100MM, thus you should theoretically owe $20MM in taxes.  But, to date, you haven't even made $20MM over the entire life of the business (assuming it is quickly-growing)!  Or, you might have made $20MM, but you almost certainly don't *have* $20MM.  To make matters worse, your business is privately held, so it isn't particularly easy to just go sell $20MM worth of shares on the open market, and doing so would mean you now have a partner in your business, which you might not want.

A lot of discussion on this proposal has centered around the Bezos and Musk crowd, but there are a significant number of entrepreneurs who own $100MM (on paper) businesses, especially in today's world of high multipliers.  Some of these people have never had $20MM in cash in their lives, and their businesses are small enough that the $100MM valuation isn't particularly stable.  Saying they owe $20MM in taxes is crazy, and it has the potential to wipe them out.  There is a reason we don't tax unrealized gains.",4

Structured notes are a type of debt instrument that is linked to an underlying reference such as the S&amp;P 500 or oil.

Barclays said it is conducting a review of the matter. Regulators, too, are “conducting inquiries and making requests for information,” the bank said. As a result, the bank will delay the start of its £1 billion share-buyback program to the second quarter. 

Barclays shares fell 3.6% on Monday, their biggest drop in weeks. 

Expensive flubs are rare in the world of banking, which is built upon a web of technology, policies and procedures designed to nearly eliminate the risk of human error. But mistakes happen. Citigroup Inc. in 2020 accidentally sent $900 million to creditors of cosmetics company Revlon Inc. Last year, the U.K. arm of Banco Santander SA mistakenly paid out £130 million into thousands of random accounts. 

Barclays is known for its large fixed-income business, so the mistake is especially surprising. Analysts and investors struggled to make sense of the announcement. 

“I’ve seen a lot of structured note issuance but I’ve never seen this kind of matter before,” said Joseph Dickerson, an equity research analyst at Jefferies. 

“It looks like an operational or legal failure,” said Jerome Legras, managing partner at Axiom Alternative Investments, a fund that specializes in bank debt. “It’s hard to believe they would do such a stupid thing. This honestly is the first time I’ve heard of something like this.”

Barclays will have to buy the notes at the original purchase price. The estimated loss indicates that a substantial amount of the notes are currently trading below what investors paid for them. In fact, Barclays is more underwater on the notes than it appears: The bank’s calculation includes tax breaks associated with the loss.

Barclays’s iPath Pure Beta Crude Oil ETNs maturing in 2041 and iPath Series B S&amp;P 500 Vix Short-Term Futures ETNs due in 2048 are among the affected notes. The bank stopped selling and issuing new notes a few weeks ago, saying it didn’t have the capacity to do so. They are still trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Barclays breached the limits of what is known as a shelf registration, which is put in place so an issuer can parcel out the sale of a chunk of bonds without seeking regulatory approval each time. The limit is typically outlined ahead of time in the bond prospectus and can be extended. 

“In this case, it looks like they forgot to extend this limit,” Mr. Legras said. 

Barclays said the loss will dent its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key metric of financial health, but it is expected to remain within the bank’s target range of 13% to 14% on March 31.

I am super grateful that I have my hubby to talk to but that's about it. Just wondering if anyone else feels lonely especially when you don't have people to talk to about trading in real life?",4
2320,stocks,"Sorry I know this is pretty dense, but I think these two articles are worth a read. The [FT article is much shorter](https://archive.ph/mHJhb#selection-2069.0-2094.0) so you can start with that one:

&gt; An alternative interpretation of a potential inversion is that bond markets are on board with the Fed’s strategy and believe that inflation will stabilise in the long term. A far more concerning prospect is a steep rise in long-term yields. This would indicate market belief that high rates will be needed for some time in order to achieve price stability. At the moment, movements in equity markets indicate that many investors remain bullish — the S&amp;P 500 has shown no signs of sustained falls.

&gt; Either way, there is good reason to think that “this time is different”. The predictive powers of inversion have never been truly tested at a time of very large central bank holdings of long-term debt. The Fed not only has to make choices about the level at which to set its main short-term policy rate but also how to manage its own vast stock of Treasuries. At present, Powell is indicating the central bank will first raise short-term rates and only then start selling its longer-dated bonds. An inverted yield curve would make some sense if markets believe the Fed will see this policy through.

&gt; Inverted yield curves may have historically predicted recession, but what inversion has meant in the past does not preclude a different outcome now or in the future. In any case, as all good economists know, an exception is always needed to prove a rule.

Here's another more [technical article from Reuters](https://archive.ph/FkPR0) arguing that U.S. Treasury yield curve divergence sends mixed recession signals.

&gt; But the 2-year/10-year yield curve also has its technical issues, and not everyone is convinced it's telling the true story.
&gt; ""Something like 2s/10s, or 5s/30s, will definitely tell you that we're a lot flatter than we've ever been at the start of a hiking cycle,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

&gt; ""Part of that is just the sheer amount of Treasuries that the Fed bought during their COVID QE (quantitative easing) program."" Analysts said the Fed's QE the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield and could explain away the disparity in the two yield curves.

&gt; Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York cited research which suggests the 10-year yield would be around 3.60% without that stimulus. When the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet via quantitative tightening, Shipley said the 10-year yield will rise to fair value.

&gt; The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.475% after hitting a peak of 2.5% on Friday, the highest since May 2019.

&gt; ""Without QE/balance sheet expansion, the 10-year and 2-year spread would be around 140 basis points, which is hardly threatening and consistent with the 10-year and 3-month spread,"" Shipley said.

&gt; The Evercore analyst thinks the 10-year yield should approach fair value in the first half of 2024, or about 120 basis points higher than the current level.

&gt; The U.S. 2-year yield, on the other hand, is fairly priced and Shipley expects the 2s-10s curve to widen.

&gt; What does it mean for the U.S. economy?

&gt; ""Some of the 2-10 shape is down to the fact this is a far more aggressively priced Fed cycle than usual, the notion of how quickly the Fed will move is very front-loaded,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy, at State Street.

&gt; ""I suspect we will get a growth slowdown but will it lead to recession? It may be next year's story. Households will want to see the fuel prices coming down but generally household balance sheets are in pretty good shape.""

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
&gt; However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
&gt; The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
&gt; “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
&gt; Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
&gt; Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

While I was initially thinking of without a doubt doing this, as I'm sure there will be some juicy price action after the split I came upon a dilemma that I'm curious about. By multiplying the float by 20x, is that gonna just eradicate movement and end up hurting options pricing in the long run? Sure in the beginning I'm sure the volatility and open interest will pick up, but after that it kinda screams apple to me where premiums just won't be worth it. Am I thinking about this right from an options perspective?",4
2328,stocks,"Shares of shot up Monday, after the electric vehicle giant disclosed plans to enable a stock split, which would be the second in two years.

The company TSLA, -0.32% said in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will ask shareholders to approve an increase in the number of shares outstanding. The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.

The stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13. It slipped 0.3% on Friday to close at $1,010.64, to snap an eight-day winning streak. Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.

Tesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31. In the 2021 proxy statement, the company said it is authorized to have 2.00 billion shares outstanding.

The company’s only other stock split, a 5-to-1 split, took effect on Aug. 31, 2020. At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.

To lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.

Although a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.

Tesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.

Tesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.51% has gained 14.3% over the past year.

2336,stocks,"Instead of buying shares and holding them for multiple years, I am thinking to buy the shares around 30 minutes before market close on the trading day before ex-dividend date. I will also sell ATM calls expiring soon (with expiration date this Friday or 3rd Friday of the month) against the shares before the market close.

The ATM calls sold will have time value around half of dividend yield. This will ensure there is a non-zero likelihood that the shares will be called away on the same day. For example, if a stock gives 4% annual dividend (1% dividend per quarter), we sell ATM calls with remaining time value equivalent to \~50% dividend received.

If everything goes well, we should net \~2% from the stock per year. It should not be too hard to repeat it 5 times to reach 10% annual return. Of course, we need to pick the stocks carefully (e.g., no stocks with 20%+ annual dividend that are about to bankrupt), and be ready to start selling more calls against the shares until break even if the shares are not called away.

This strategy may not be appealing in 2020 and 2021, but as the dividend stocks will be more favorable during high inflation period from 2022 to 2024, it looks like a very good risk-adjusted strategy. What do you all think about this?",4

2338,stocks,"Everyone that says Cash is Trash, obviously doesn't count their stock gains in US dollars.  Inflation maybe closer to 10% than 2%, but that doesn't mean cash isn't useful.  I could for example buy a years supply of food today cheaper than tomorrow.  I could pay off my 3% car loan today and save 3% over paying tomorrow.  Yes, after inflation a 3% loan seems like a good deal over 10% inflation.  But the question you need to ask yourself is where would you put that cash?  Stocks are clearly going thru a dead cat bounce and will go lower after the next interest rate hikes. Dividend stocks give you a bit of insurance, but most divy stocks pay a lower dividend cash flow than inflation.  Non divy stocks require the greater fool to pay more tomorrow than you did today to make a profit.  But with a higher interest rate to get a loan asset prices will begin to fall. The US dollar is debt, and once debt is paid off or destroyed the money supply decreases.  The Fed has decided to crash the economy and stock market to slow inflation.  Good luck everyone.",4

2344,stocks,"Hi guys, as most of you probably know, graphic cards by NVIDIA have been very expensive especially due to the mining of crypto.

However, in the past few years, it has been unprofitable to mine Bitcoin with graphic cards due to ASICs miner machines that are much more efficient. And now, Ethereum is moving to a ""**transition to a proof-of-stake protocol**"" very soon, so it will be impossible to mine with graphic cards. All in all, impossible to mine the 2 main crypto currencies with a graphic card.

The cost to acquire an NVDIA graphic card has already started to decline over this weekend. NVDA is trading at very high multiples right now with a lot of growth priced in. We can anticipate a decline in demand for GPU, but also will the crypto miners turn around and sell their GPU pushing the prices down even more?

2346,stocks,"If interest rates go up that means people will probably put their money into bonds or banks right? Does that mean it should be obvious to us that it won't be a strong market?

Based on recent history this definitely seems to be the case. They had an aggressive rate hike recently (2019) and it started to hurt the market. Then the market suffered during covid but the fed was miraculously able to save the market by taking alot of action. The question is can the stock market survive the feds tapering and the rise of interest rates? 

 The word tapering itself is very fitting. Tapering is a term that is also used to describe people who are trying to slowly come off drug addiction. There's good amount of evidence to suggest that the market is addicted to the feds support. You only have to look at the ridiculous rise in stock prices from just before COVID to now. For example Tesla went from 150$ in February 2020 to a ridiculous 1000 this week. It just doesn't make sense that something could rise that much during a crisis.  Amd went from 45$ to 120$ during the same time frame. The sp500 went up about 25% and the dow 18%. The  Vanguard Total Stock Market Index is an accumulation of every us stocks price into one index. It went from 78$- 112$ per share within the same time frame. That might not seem like much but it's about 35-40 percent rise. 

Another thing to consider is that the fed might believe that some degree of this inflation is transitory. This could lead to a less aggressive rate hike which could be good for stocks. The problem with that assumption is that many analysts have been predicting 5-6 rate hikes which would be about 2-2.5 percent.",4

2360,stocks,"Personally i recommend that everyone gets financially educated and learns how to do basic investing.  Even if you decide to select an advisor instead investing your self this will help you manage them.  

In my experience many advisors are simply sales people who are going to push you into a managed product then move on. ***this assumes you have &gt;1-2 million in investable assets***. 

Once you start getting to higher Investable asset levels there are some things like IPOs and tax advice that you can get that are very useful as well as unique investment products.  

If your going to select an advisor here are some things to ask:

1. Google their broker U4.  Here is the link: https://brokercheck.finra.org/ 

This is online and simple to find. This shows all their customer complaints and issues. Obvi avoid anyone with complaints

2.  Understand what their client asset tiers are.  Advisors get compensated based on Assets they manage.  They literally are told to focus on higher value clients! 

2.1. Related to point 2. Smaller brokerage firms tend to less good advanced products for high asset clients like IPO access. However they also don’t push advisors to focus only on higher asset clients as much.  If you have more assets then a larger firm maybe a better choice.   

3. Ask about what types of products do they normally put clients into.  Ask them their opinion on ETFs (typically they want to avoid ETFs unless in a managed account)

4. Ask them how often you will be talking with them

5.  Ask how their advice will be different than simply putting money into a target date fund

6. Ask how they get compensated.  Ask on every product they want to put you in what your costs are

7.  Ask to see what your financial report and website will look like

8.  Ask them how often you will be meeting them.  

9.  Try to understand their approach to the markets.  Are they aggressive? Conservative?  Obviously you want to match your goals vs their approach 

10.   Do they come across as salesy and pushy? Are they cocky? Then avoid

2362,stocks,"Russian stock market, crushed by war, opens with big limits

1:11 AM ET, 03/24/2022 - Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — The Russian stock market opened Thursday for limited trading under heavy restrictions for the first time since Moscow invaded Ukraine, coming almost a month after prices plunged and the market was shut down as a way to insulate the economy.

Trading of a limited number of stocks, including energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, took place under curbs meant to prevent a repeat of the massive selloff on Feb. 24 that came in anticipation of Western economic sanctions.

The significant restrictions on trading Thursday underlined Russia's economic isolation and the pressure on the financial system despite central bank efforts to curb market plunges. Foreigners could not sell stocks, and traders were barred from short selling — or betting prices will fall — while the government has said it will spend $10 billion on shares in coming months, a move that should support prices.

The benchmark MOEX index gained 4.4% as some companies partially recovered losses from the plunge on the day of the invasion. Airline Aeroflot bucked the positive trend by losing 16.4% — not a surprise after the U.S., European Union and others banned Russian planes from their airspaces.

Russian stocks were only a small part of emerging market share indexes even before the war and only for those with a high risk tolerance, given extensive cronyism, nontransparent accounting and widespread state interference. They lost any attraction for most foreign investors when the Moscow Exchange was dubbed “uninvestable” about a week into the war.

“The stock market is really almost a sideshow at this point,” said Chris Weafer, CEO at Macro-Advisory Ltd., a consulting firm. “It’s more a sentiment indicator because obviously companies are not raising any money on the stock market, and they won’t be able to.”

He said, however, that state-owned banks or funds may have been buying to support prices: “It does look like state-supported buying rather than any genuine interest on the part of investors.”

Government efforts to stabilize stocks and the ruble that has plunged in value are a way to show that some confidence was returning and “to try to get that message across to people not to panic, that this is a temporary situation that will improve,” Weafer said. Nonetheless, he added, the Russian financial system remained in a “fragile” state.

Tim Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said reopened trading was “deeply managed” and suggested that “for those Russians with some spare cash, there is nothing much else to buy as hedge to inflation and currency collapse.”

Restrictions like shutting down and restricting the stock market are among those that Russia has taken to shore up the financial system against utter collapse, but they also close off the economy to trade and investment that could fuel growth.

Some foreign hedge funds have expressed interest in shopping for distressed assets — viable companies trading at knocked-down prices — but they have no way to take part because of the trading restrictions, Weafer said.

A U.S. official called the severely restricted trading a “charade.”

“This is not a real market and not a sustainable model, which only underscores Russia’s isolation from the global financial system,” Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic adviser to President Joe Biden, said in a statement.

The economic turmoil in Russia from sanctions and the war has been severe. Hundreds of U.S., European and Japanese companies have pulled out of Russia. There have been bank runs and panic buying of sugar and other staples. The exchange rate of Russia’s ruble has tumbled.

Outside Russia, the reopening of stock trading on the Moscow Exchange has little impact, including on the vast majority of U.S. investors’ portfolios, said Leanna Devinney with Fidelity Investments.

The exchange's market capitalization — about $773 billion at the end of last year, according to the World Federation of Exchanges — is a fraction of that of major Western or Asian markets. In comparison, the total of all equities on the New York Stock Exchange is roughly $28 trillion.

Russia's central bank estimates that retail investors owned roughly 7.7 trillion rubles of stock, equal to $79 billion, as of late 2021.

Stocks last traded in Moscow on Feb. 25, a day after the MOEX sank 33% after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Russia restarted trading in ruble-denominated government bonds earlier this week.

Roughly a week into the conflict, Russia was removed from emerging markets indexes compiled by MSCI after it determined the market to be “uninvestable.”

The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of 27 companies with links to Russia on March 3, including some of the biggest in energy and finance. The shares lost most of their value before that: Rosneft dropped from $7.91 on Feb. 16 to 60 cents on March 2. Sberbank plunged from $14.90 to 5 cents.",4

Consumer sentiment has dipped below 60 three times before: 1980, 2008-2009, and 2011. These historical events were a recession from the Volcker rate hikes, another recession after the Great Financial Crisis, and fears shortly afterwards when the credit rating of the US federal government was downgraded by Moody's.

From the University of Michigan: ""When asked to explain changes in their finances in their own words, more consumers mentioned reduced living standards due to rising inflation than any other time except during the two worst recessions in the past fifty years: from March 1979 to April 1981, and from May to October 2008. Moreover, 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead, the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s.

I’ve noticed with stocks such as this, Bros, SG etc the more vehement and combative the discussion is is usually a good reason to be bullish on the stocks (at the right price of course). “Overvalued” is a term that many of the best stocks such as Amazon and google dealt with for years. 

Anytime I hear a stock is “overvalued” I am now taking even closer interest in it. Missed a decent amount of gains on stocks like Costco, CF, NTR and oil stocks listening to the “overvalued” crowd… 

 Not financial advice but Tesla out of all my growth stocks has been holding up fantastically well (bought in february)",4

2375,stocks,"Hello all,

Wanted to get some opinions here. I recently (finally) put some money into the market with inflation being what it is. I own a variety of ETFs, murual funds and a bit of individual stocks. My question obviously pertains to VOO here.

When comparing SPY and VOO, you'll notice they are virtually identical. The biggest differences are expense ratio (VOO wins) and option volume (SPY wins).

My question is, I would assume most long term holders that plan onto DCAIng into the market gradually to hold long term will choose VOO due to the lower expense ratio. Do you think that, a ways down the road, option volume will approach what SPY is currently at? I would love to ultimately start selling covered calls. If it's likely VOO option volume will increase, I'll continue with VOO, but if not I may consider closing the position and averaging in to SPY instead.

Thanks!",4

2378,stocks,"Note: I originally posted this in r/collegebasketball, but it got removed as they're more interested in bar graphs created in MS Paint so I'm posting here (Yes, I am a bit salty). I took out a section explaining ETF's as I assume anyone here has a decent grasp of what those are

**TL;DR** 

There are some innovative companies in the holdings of QQQ, but not near as much innovation happens here as the commercials would have you believe. Using the methodology described below, I (very subjectively) find the QQQ fund to have an ""innovation rating"" of **49.27%**. 

**Intro/Background Info** 

If you're watching the NCAA Basketball tournament, you've probably seen the advertisements for the Invesco QQQ fund, claiming investors are ""part of the team"" and ""taking part in innovation"". Tossing aside the dubious first claim (you're no more part of any team than Packers stockholders are; holding shares in an ETF doesn't even grant you voting rights), let's take a look at the ""innovation"" claim.


**Are companies held by the QQQ Fund truly innovative?**


As of market close on Friday, March 25th, the QQQ fund held stock in 101 companies (due to a quirk in Alphabet/Google's share structure, it actually holds 102 different stocks). The holdings can be found [here](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qqq/holdings/). I've split them into categories below (percentages are of total holdings) and given them a very subjective rating of innovation. A couple of general rules of thumb I went by:

* Innovation, in my interpretation of the QQQ commercials, means one of two things: Either ""Something new that changes the industry"" or ""Marked improvement to a current offering that makes it better"". 

* Finding a better way to extract money from customers (ie. turning your product into a software-as-a-service rental) is not innovation in the spirit it's being presented to us.

**Methodology**

I assigned each category an ""Innovation rating"" in which I used my own subjective judgment to assign a rating from 0 to 1 that represents how much I think the company embodies the spirit of ""Innovation"" as the commercials for QQQ present to us (with 1 being ""true innovator"" and 0 being ""no innovation whatsoever). Each category's rating is multiplied by the percentage of the fund's holdings in that category to create a weighted average innovation rating for the QQQ Fund. That number comes out to be **49.27%**. 

* Notes: If you don't like how I've rated companies, make your own post. Also note that the percentages don't *exactly* add up to 100%, the fund holds a little bit of cash as well. Also, you can easily buy stocks in these companies individually. You don't need QQQ to own shares in these companies for you if that's what you want. 

**RATINGS**

**Big, Old Tech Companies** (Innovation rating:.4)

 These companies are the big players in the tech industry. Are they innovators? I give them an innovation rating of .4 as they do create new products regularly, but their main innovations buying up anyone that actually innovates and turning the software industry into an unfortunate hellscape where they collect absurd amounts of data on you to sell, make minimal changes and sell them as a ""new product, or turn their products into ""rental contracts"" that they have all the power over. 

* Apple (12.53%)

* Microsoft (10.06%)

* Google Class A (3.94%)

* Google Class C - No voting rights (3.76%)

* Facebook (3.35%)

* Netflix (1.22%; I almost moved them to the category below as, while they changed an industry, they've clearly lost the first-mover advantage and media consumption is quickly returning to a cable-style landscape where we pay for 50 things we don't want to watch just so we can get the one thing we do want to watch)

* Adobe (1.49%)

* Baidu (0.27%; real big in China)

**Archaic Tech and Telecom Companies** (Innovation rating): 0)

While these are tech companies, they operate on old business models and haven't done anything new for over a decade, thus I can't abide calling them ""innovators"". Mostly they get by on being the biggest (or only accessible) provider of their service. Anyone creating an online retailer or auction service gets put in this category as the timeframe for calling that ""innovation"" has long passed

* Amazon (7.35%; Amazon has grown so large and conglomerated that it's hard to categorize, and there are some decently innovative tech offerings like AWS, but for the most part the ""innovation"" that Amazon does is something someone else does first that is either copied or acquired by Amazon)

* Ebay (0.25%)

* Sirius XM (0.19%)

* AirBnB (0.46%)

* Charter Communications (0.71% heard of Spectrum?)

* T Mobile (1.15%; I might be a little unfair putting them in this category, but the very-consolidated telecom industry as a whole has shown that innovation is nowhere near its primary focus)

* Comcast (1.55%)

* Booking Holdings (0.68%; heard of priceline.com?)

* Mercado Libre (0.46%)

* JD.com (0.27%)

* Copart (0.22%; specifically deals with selling cars through online auctions)

* Pinduoduo (0.15%)


**Computer Hardware, Network Infrastructure, and Cybersecurity** (Innovation rating: .9)

By far the biggest category in terms of number of companies, this catch-all category represents tech companies that exist by staying ahead of the curve. In the case of cybersecurity firms, it's because they contractually have to, but most of the companies here would easily fall by the wayside if they quit innovating (at least until Covid put a bottleneck in semiconductors and chip manufacturing). I could easily split this into smaller categories, but they'd score similar ratings in my very subjective system

* NVidia (4.37%)

* AMD (1.44%)

* Cisco Systems (1.66%)

* Verisign (0.17%)

* Intel (1.54%)

* Broadcom (1.88%)

* Qualcomm (1.31%)

* Texas Instruments (1.25%; they do a lot more than make calculators!)

* Applied Materials (0.90%)

* Micron Technology (0.64%)

* Analog Devices (0.63%)

* Lam Research (0.57%)

* Marvell Technology (0.46%)

* Palo Alto Networks (0.45%)

* ASML Holdings (0.42%)

* KLA Corporation (0.40%)

* Fortinet (0.40%)

* NXP Semiconductors (0.37%)

* Synopsys (0.37%)

* Crowdstrike Holdings (0.34%)

* Cadence Design Systems (0.33%)

* Microchip Technology (0.32%)

* ZScaler (0.24%)

* Skyworks Solutions (0.17%)

**Business and Financial Tech** (Innovation Rating: .7)

These companies fulfill some tech need of businesses. I give them a somewhat high innovation rating as most have transformed some aspect of business over the last decade, but the score suffers as sometimes the changes are either faulty, unwelcome, or just plain arbitrary, and they're frequently the target of customer complaints

* Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (0.67%)

* Zoom Video Communications (0.21%)

* PayPal (0.99%)

* Fiserv (0.47%)
 
* Cognizant Technology Solutions (0.35%)

* Workday (0.35%; ""cloud based human capital management"" sounds pretty dystopian, doesn't it?)

* Paychex (0.34%)

* Atlassian (0.30%; a company that does ""software for software developers"", I almost put them in the Big, Old Tech group because, while coming up with the fairly popular Jira 20 years ago, they spent most of the past decade buying up other innovations without coming up with any of their own)

* Datadog (.29%)

* Verisk Analytics (0.25%)

* Splunk (0.17%)

* Okta, Inc. (0.16%)

* Docusign (0.15%)

**Innovation Companies** (Innovation rating: 1)

Non-Biotech companies that provide a new class of product. Strangely, they're either electric vehicles or medical equipment

* Tesla (4.62%)

* Lucid Motors (0.32%)

* Intuitive Surgical (0.74%)

* Dexcom (0.33%)

* Align Technology (0.25%)


**Retailers** (Innovation rating: 0)

Old companies that exist to sell other companies products. Pretty self-explanatory why the innovation rating here is a big fat zero

* Costco (1.81%)

* O'Reilley Automotive (0.34%)

* Wallgreens Boots Alliance (0.30%)

* Dollar Tree (0.26%)

* Ross Stores (0.23%)

**Food and Beverage** (Innovation Rating: .05)

Mostly old companies that get by on flagship products that have been around longer than most of us have been alive. Avoids the 0 by occasionally creating something new

* PepsiCo (1.67%)

* Starbucks (0.73%)

* Mondelez International (0.62%)

* Keurig Dr. Pepper (0.39%)

* Kraft Heinz (0.35%)

* Monster Beverage (0.30%)

**Non-IT infrastructure** (Innovation rating: .7)

These companies represent ""things that get built"" that aren't computer related. Buildings, aircraft, materials, they all find themselves here. The relatively high innovation rating represents a lot of innovating that we don't see

* Honeywell (0.98%)

* CSX Corporation (0.59%)

* Autodesk (0.34%; included here because, even though it's a software company, it's a major part of this industry)

* Ansys (0.20%; included here for the same reasons as Autodesk)

* Old Dominion Freight Line (0.27%)

* Fastenal Company (0.24%)

* PACCAR (0.23%)

**BioTech** (Innovation rating: 1)

Companies in this area either find new products or cease to exist. A true ""innovate or die"" world, though if a company is big enough it can ""innovate"" by acquiring the real innovators or providing the infrastructure for the real innovators to scale up

* Amgen (0.97%) 

* Gilead Sciences (0.54%)

* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (0.53%)

* Moderna (0.53%)

* Vertex Pharmaceuticals (0.47%)

* Illumina (0.39%)

* IDEXX Laboratories (0.33%; this company focuses on veterinary applications)

* AstraZeneca (0.28%)

* Biogen (0.23%)

* Seagen (0.19%)

**Financial services and Tax preparation** (Innovation rating: -.5)

I've separated this company out and given it a negative innovation rating, as the company is known for lobbying against updating the process of filing taxes, which I consider to be an anti-innovative practice 

* Intuit (0.97%)

**Video games and Dating** (.4)

The real innovative players in this field are much smaller companies, but occasionally one of these shows a flash of brilliance 

* Activision Blizzard (0.45%)

* Electronic Arts (0.26%)

* Match Group (0.22%; you'd be surprised how many dating services are all owned by this one company!)

* NetEase (0.14%; in addition to being a video game developer, Wikipedia states ""The company also owns several pig farms."")

**Hotels** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Nothing innovative about a hotel

* Marriot International (0.41%)

**Utilities** (Innovation rating: .2)

While improvements in power generation exist, the utility companies aren't innovative in the way the QQQ commercials would have you believe

* American Electric Power (.36%)

* Exelon (0.32%)

* XCel Energy (0.28%)

* Constellation Energy (0.13%)




**Non-Tech Business Support** (Innovation Rating: 0)

Founded as a laundry company, Cintas provides laundry services, restroom supplies, low-level medical supplies, and PPE to businesses

* Cintas (0.31%)

**Clothing** (Innovation Rating: .05)

The only actual clothing maker on the list, Lululemon survives off of one (admittedly pretty industry-changing) innovative thought made 20 years ago

* Lululemon Athletica (0.29%)",4

2384,stocks,"Hi friends, I am not an expert stock trader/investor by any means but I thought I’d mention how Home Depot is a solid buy for me. Home Depot is currently the 27th most valuable stock by market cap, and I think it will continue to grow.

1. In the 3 month chart, SPY is down 4% whereas HD is down 22%. I don’t think HD deserved to be hit harder than SPY in this bear market, so I think putting your money into HD has higher potential for growth than companies that went down in proportion with SPY.
2. Bears on HD are mentioning that people remodeled their house a lot during the covid pandemic but the pandemic is coming to an end. My response: People really will find any reason to be bearish. Not every stock is a pandemic stock. Google is a pandemic stock too because people will stop googling about covid, etc. 
3. I think people don’t realize that Home Depot is not just a store that sells hammers and nails. They deserve to be put in the same category as companies like Walmart who always have potential to do more.
4. The “Home” category is generic enough that they have potential to break into many different other industries. I could definitely see them competing with companies like Best Buy in the tech industry (did you know that Home Depot sells TVs?). They could also venture into industries like furniture, maybe compete with IKEA. 
5. The company has a good reputation for being a reliable and friendly company that treats their salaried employees well (yes their minimum wage employees will probably have things to complain about but that’s every company).
6. They are dominant in both brick and mortar stores and in ecommerce. What’s not to like about that?
7. I’m not well versed enough to look at their financials and judge their stock price based on that, but they are way down from their ATH, and I just think the stock market is a ponzi scheme anyway that doesn’t have much connection to the fundamentals like that.

During 3rd panel interviews, it was 3 hours interviews, including a quick presentation of my previous projects and lunch time, all of which are about to judge me as a potential employee and a colleague, indicating how much selective they are. I dont like it from the begining to the end. 

And per glassdoor, this position pays around 95K as a base pay in the location.

# Fed's evaluation and rate hike

Part of reason here is to vent about this distorted job markets, but primary reason to share is to see if this what's called ""Strong job market"" is able to support Fed's rate hike in the next course of the months, if not years, without causing recessions? 

Fed might say that due to great resignation and population change (Boomers retiring and more workforce is needed), the labor market clearly favors employees, but I am not sure if that will actually support the economy in the long run. Great resignation people who might have benefited in 2021's bull run are running almost out of their profits. 

Current index level is about May 2021, and many still are uncertain if recent 2 weeks' market run-up is only the beginning of the bear markets or will start to recover. So those great resignation folks might have to come back to workforce when Index crashed another 10-15%. 

Then when it come to population change, corporates wont simply hire a new employee just because the employee is leaving. Sure, when department manager complains and bring it to the issue to upper management, it might, but corporate America is all about squeezing employees out like slaves, and return the money back to share holders, so if they find out the department can run without the retired employees, then they wont simply hire (I am currently working in one of the tickers that I have shared, but have seen this case so often that there is no replacement for the leaving employees, and the left over is on current employees). 

So how does this mean strong labor market will continue? 

Understandably, it can really differ depending on which sectors and regions, for instance, one of my family members just got into JPM as investor consultant, and the starting point was 150K in NYC, which would be almost same as 70-80K in my area when it comes to buying powers per nerd wallet living cost calculator. 

Also yes, if I want to work in MCD flipping burgers or in WMT/COST just loading some boxes, sure I can be hired within 30 minutes, but do we really call this as strong job markets? In other words, 15$ per hour job is available everywhere, but do we really call it a job? It's just part time gig that is only used as a stepping stone to move to next chapter of life. 

Then when it comes to actual jobs that have potential career ladders, this kind of jobs are highly selective such as what I went through, and with technologies developing, the demand for workforce will be likely discontinued.  

# Big Question: Okay, so what? What's the outcome? 

Perhaps, no one knows the outcome including any Fed members, but I still believe that deflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to labor markets and inflationary pressure are at full force when it comes to raw materials due to deglobalization of the current political climate.

To me it sounds like exactly stagflation, where no one can make money, but who knows? The chance is I will be most likely wrong, and I hope I am wrong on this.",4

Im just looking for input. So I made this mind Game. 

I would not only like hear what stock would you pick but also why. One sentence is usualy enough.

Why this rules ? 
It sounds kinda lame I admit but I caught myself manytimes when I had to choose only one stock I evaluate the stock more carefully and usualy its my best stock! 

In the ideal world I should examine every stock very carefully but with more options I have, I tend to get more reckless. (In my terms which is still careful)

- slowing growth/competition: guidance so far is amazing and Googl tends to beat estimates. Competition in search engine, YouTube and other Google applications seem weak, only in cloud computing they are the underdog compared to MSFT and AMAZON, which is a small part of their company.

GOOGL is my biggest holding, so I would be very interested why I shouldn't be making it even bigger at the current valuation.",4

2403,stocks,"So I just noticed that boxed positions (both long and short) is available in TOS, and when checking with TOS trade desks, they seem to not like the idea of it, saying that it wont provide any real profits, because whichever direction it moves, it will do nothing but use buying powers provided that it's 1:1 ratio to both long and short.

True, but if timing is right, then it can give more benefits?

I give them specific examples, where stock A is traded at 100$ per shares on 9 AM. Then at 10 AM, this stock crashed to 90$ per shares, where I covered the short positions.

Then, later at 11 AM, it skyrocketed to 110$, so I sold long positions to close. In both ways, I could make 10$ per profits for each directions.

True, the reality will be really complicated enough that the odd will be not happening like this scenario, where just because I buy to close (covering the short position at 90) doesnt mean it can't crash even further to 80 (let's just say this numbers), so I would be still 10$ per share net negative if that occurs, but at the end of days, stock will go up should the stock valuation is right around 110$ per shares.

Like if I dont mind it holding it for a while until it goes up to 110$, which is my target price.

Typically, when I long on position, it goes down for next couple of days, but if I can open boxed positions, then it will help to offset some losses (when I covered the short).

Sure, there will be margin maintenance and interest fees, and I dont mind it costing some extra fees, but is there something wrong in this scenarios? They keep saying that there is no real benefits whatsoever, but more disadvantages for the fees and margin maintenance, not to mention buying powers, which I totally agree to.

2411,stocks,"#Intro

I’m going to outline 8 reasons why I believe the US remains the best place in the world to invest. This will cover culture, future projections, economic sectors, and international relations. This is going to try to remain as factual as possible with all information sited. Each of these bullet points is going to be generally stating why the US markets have an advantage over other developed markets like Europe and Japan or an advantage over developing markets such as China and India. [This is the theory behind the strategy that I run]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAnalysis/comments/ry1qq5/efficient_leveraged_portfolios/) and suggest to people to best take advantage of this market.

###More Investors
 * In the United States if you want to retire well off you need to be invested in all non-outlier cases. Some people chose real estate, but stocks are far more popular. About [5 percent of people own a second property]( https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/10/nations-stock-of-second-homes-2/) which I’m using as a rough proxy for how many people would be considered real estate investors. The point is that it’s a very low number. To contrast this between [52]( https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/25/more-than-half-of-u-s-households-have-some-investment-in-the-stock-market/) and [56]( https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) percent of people are invested in the stock market. Social security exists as a safety net, but it will barely keep you out of poverty. In the 1980’s [60% of workers had a defined benefit pension. This is down to just 4% now.]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm) This means that if a majority of people currently working want to retire comfortably, they need the market to do well. This is a bullish sign for the market for two main reasons. The first is that most of these people are adding a portion of their paycheck to various index funds every other week. These massive monetary inflows create a permanent upward pressure on the market. The second reason is less direct, but due to the scale of the incentive for the market to do well, laws, regulations, and interest rates are all going to be biased in favor of the market. This explains a reason why the US market should trend up, but why should it trend up faster than other markets? The answer is that the percentage of people who invest in other countries is far smaller. [15% of people in Germany, 17% of people in the Netherlands, 33% of people in the UK]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm), and [only 7% of people in China]( https://www.thebalance.com/china-stock-market-shanghai-shenzhen-hong-kong-3305480#:~:text=Only%207%20percent%20of%20China's,swings%20in%20China's%20stock%20market.&amp;text=In%20China%2C%20less%20than%2020,is%20in%20the%20stock%20market.) hold stocks. This means the inflows to their markets are smaller and the incentive to favor the market in their national policies is weaker. This is only one of many factors that influence market movements.

###High Consumer Spending
 * In the United States people are incredibly fond of spending. It’s quite straightforward that a lot of spending means a lot of money flowing into businesses. These elevated cashflows directly lead to increased stock prices. Now of course not all companies only do business in their home country, but that’s where most of their revenue typically comes from. The way I decided to compare this with other countries spending is by looking at [household consumption as a percent of GDP]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/consumption_GDP/#:~:text=Household%20consumption%20is%20about%2060,over%2080%20percent%20of%20GDP.). The US is not at the top of the list, but it is significantly higher than most of its wealthy peers. 68% of US GDP comes from household consumption compared to 52% in Japan or 51% in the EU. You can also see the [sheer scale of US consumer spending when it’s displayed nominally]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/household_consumption_dollars/). The people of the US spend 7x as much as the people of Germany, even though the US only has a bit over 3x the people. 

###Low (Enough) Corruption
 * Despite all of the issues you see on the news about the US government and its politicians, it’s a relatively uncorrupted country. [While it scores far from the top on the control of corruption index]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_corruption/) the idea is that it’s more than good enough to invest in. The main point is that it ranks far above most major developing countries that could in theory outgrow the US markets in the next couple decades such as Brazil, India, and China. Despite these countries generally having higher annual GDP growth, their uncertainty and inconsistency when it comes to investing scares away a lot of potential money. This gives the US markets an advantage over most developing markets but doesn’t provide any advantage over Europe for this point. 

###Past Performance Indicates Future Performance
 * Everyone has heard that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but guarantee is the problem word there. Nothing in the market is guaranteed, but the past is still a fantastic indictor of what we can expect in the future, broadly speaking. US markets have grown at an average rate of 5-10% annually for many decades depending on what time frame you look at. This is not as true for other developed economies. Over the past 25 years the US [has returned 50% more on average annually]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/comparison/european-stocks-vs-us-stocks/) than a comparable portfolio of European stocks. The time frame is somewhat restrained by the data available in some emerging countries such as Brazil and India who both only got stable exchanges in the 1990’s. This is still far enough back to cover multiple business cycles and generally give an idea of expected returns. Over the same time frame [emerging markets returned a very similar amount]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/emerging-markets/) to their European counterparts. Of course the future could be very different, but past performance suggests that the US has the right combination of traits to be the most successful market and most of those traits likely remain. 

###Continued Population Growth
 * One of the biggest long run concerns of investors is that population growth is stagnating or even dropping in the most developed countries. The last hundred years of growth have been greatly assisted by an ever increasing population. Japan’s stock market is famously very flat. It remains [below it’s high that was achieved in the 1990s]( https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/stock-market). There are a variety of reasons for this but one of the major concerns with the country is that there population has appeared to peak and has been slowly trending down since 2010. Estimates project that they will fall from 126 million to 75 million by 2100. [The EU faces a similar issue]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20190710-1). They are projected to fall from 450 million to 416 million by 2100. This is where the US completely stands out from the rest of the developed world. The US is [projected to increase in population from 330 million to 430 million]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth) in this same time frame. This growth rate is on par with many developing countries and far ahead of ones like China and Brazil who are expected to shrink. I can’t state strongly enough how much of a comparative boost this will provide the US. I also want to point out that most of this growth is expected to come from immigration as our birth rates aren’t that much different than Europe. 

###Global Reserve Currency
 * The USD is what is known as the global reserve currency. Central banks around the world hold significant amounts of foreign currency for a variety of reasons. These include the ability to stabilize your own currency against another, facilitate international trade, and to provide protection in case of market shocks. It makes sense that other countries would hold something they think is stable, useful, and commonly accepted. The USD is this currency more often than not making up [59% of all foreign reserves]( https://blogs.imf.org/2021/05/05/us-dollar-share-of-global-foreign-exchange-reserves-drops-to-25-year-low/). It cannot be understated how powerful of an economic tool this is. We have just seen this in action when sanctions were placed on Russia. The US government [has frozen more than half a trillion in Russian reserves]( https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-central-bank.html). Another example of this being used was in 2020 when the US created trillions of new dollars. This increase in money supply was not only born by US citizens. It was absorbed globally due to the extensive currency reserves. Why does this give US markets an advantage? It provides the country as a whole with a powerful weapon that can be used to push the world into a more favorable position. It means the US can use QE to escape recession more effective than any other country, on paper at least. Lastly, it makes foreign trade incredibly easy. All of these are pieces that provide better economic conditions than their competitors can create. 

###Military Dominance
 * It’s no secret that the US spends a lot on its military. The scale is sometimes lost on people though because there’s a huge difference between being the biggest, and [being larger than the next nine combined]( https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-military-spending-vs-other-top-countries/). This military dominance is tremendously beneficial to the overall health of the economy for a couple of reasons. The first is that it provides an incredibly safe place to do business. People are hesitant about doing business in a country that has even a tiny threat of being invaded. An example that’s frequently talked about on Reddit is the possible risk of investing in Taiwan due to its proximity and scale compared to China. The US has both an ocean and the worlds largest military separating it from any hostile powers. Notice how even though Germany wasn’t attacked by Russia last month, there was still [substantial fear]( https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/stock-market) in their financial markets, though a large portion of this was related to energy fears - another issue the US outperforms in. People might mention that nuclear weapons could reach the US from just about anywhere, but I consider that a non-point. The minute nukes start flying the minute your money doesn’t mean anything anymore. There’s also an economic side to the military that can be broken into two parts. The first is that that 800 billion dollar budget needs to be spent somewhere and that somewhere is in the US economy. In the latest budget [a staggering 130 billion is allocated to research and development]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/white-house-to-seek-813-3-billion-national-security-budget), as an example. A secondary economic factor is that this military power allows the US to provide the same protection it provides itself to its allies. Groups like NATO have a “common defense clause” that basically say if you attack any member you have attacked all of the members. So even though a country like Iceland [doesn’t have a military]( https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162083.htm#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20the%20only%20Ally,the%20Alliance%20until%20the%201990s.) it is still quite safe from invasion because no one wants to go to war with the rest of the pact. Having these safe allies provides both a great place to do business, which leads to economics and trade growth. 

###Key Industry Dominance
 * Lastly, the US has economic dominance in two of the world’s most crucial industries, energy and technology. The US [is the world’s largest oil producer]( https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=709&amp;t=6) which drastically reduces their reliance on hostile foreign governments. This doesn’t mean that the country is immune to changes in the global price of oil, but it does offer comparative lower prices [than most of their developed competitors]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gasoline_prices/). It also provides some security if the world enters into a depression or becomes more fractured. On a more abstract note, the US is also the [global leader in technological development]( https://info.kpmg.us/news-perspectives/technology-innovation/us-extends-tech-innovation-leadership.html#:~:text=China%20is%20close%20behind%20but,Silicon%20Valley%20are%20rising%20fast.&amp;text=More%20than%20a%20third%20of,2018%20global%20technology%20innovation%20survey.). Technology is the backbone of the economy and being one step ahead of the rest of the world is an incredible advantage. A huge number of the worlds most advanced projects and highest potential innovations are being done by US based tech companies and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. While China is ranked #2 and gaining ground, this is not as significant as it may seem. China is not investor friendly and is unlikely to change that. Investor money is still going to flow to the US for the foreseeable future. 

#Conclusion

This has been a **BULL** case for the united states. There are currently no intentions to write a bear case as most of the points are simply going to be the inverse of the ones stated here. The goal of this post is to highlight why I believe the US, despite the last decade of massive growth, is still the worlds best place to invest and will remain so for the foreseeable future. If you want to refute one of the points please, I beg you, back up what you say with reputable sources. One thing I want to note is that just because a company is US based, that doesn’t mean those companies have a strictly US based revenue stream. Most of the massive companies that drive the market’s growth are international. If the US goes into a deep recession, most of the world will also likely go into a deep recession. There are benefits to diversification but adding more to a portfolio does not always make it better!

#TLDR
The US’s excess growth compared to other developed countries is not an anomaly. The US is highly unlikely to follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan. There are numerous factors that drove our growth that still exist and will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.",4

# **Stocks could take their cue from oil, inflation and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/stocks-could-take-their-cue-from-oil-inflation-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; With the Federal Reserve’s first rate hike out of the way, market pros are now debating whether the market can continue the upswing it started in the past week.
*****
&gt; March’s employment report is coming up in the week ahead, but developments in Ukraine, the price of oil and an inflation report are likely to steer the market.
*****
&gt; Stocks notched gains for the week, while interest rates ripped higher and oil prices jumped. Energy was the top performing sector, up more than 7%, as West Texas Intermediate crude futures closed nearly 9% higher for the week. The closely-watched 10-year Treasury yield was on a tear, reaching 2.5% Friday, its highest level since May 2019 from 2.14% just a week earlier.
*****
&gt; Traders are also watching the rise interest rates to see if they will stall the market’s gains. The S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 1.8% for the week, ending Friday at 4,543.06.
*****
&gt; “Since the war started, on the ten days that were up, the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 1%,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “I don’t think next week is going to be any different. We’re going to be headline driven, whether it’s economic data, news out of Ukraine or crude oil futures.”
*****
&gt; The market has chopped around but is higher for the month of March so far. The S&amp;P was up nearly 3.9% for the month-to-date on Friday.
*****
&gt; Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said stock charts look promising for the near term but are less clear longer term.
*****
&gt; “We should take advantage of this short-term momentum. I feel pretty good about it short-term. I mean several weeks,” she said. “We’ve also seen some nice short-term breakouts... names getting above their 50-day moving averages.”
*****
&gt; She said 58% of the S&amp;P 500 companies are now above their 50-day moving averages, a positive sign for momentum. The 50-day is simply the average closing price over the past 50 sessions, and a move above it can signal more upside.
*****
&gt; Stocks like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet have all regained their 50-day moving averages, she said. Stockton noted that some high-growth tech names have also done so. She pointed to CLOU, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF.
*****
&gt; As for yields, she said the 10-year looks set to consolidate now that it has touched 2.50%. Her next target is 2.55%. “If we get above 2.55%, the next hurdle is 3.25%,” she said.
*****
&gt; # Jobs and inflation
&gt; There is a busy economic calendar in the week ahead, highlighted by the March jobs report and personal consumption expenditures data.
*****
&gt; Consumer confidence and home price data will be released Tuesday.
*****
&gt; PCE includes an inflation measure that is closely watched by the Fed. Economists expect to see core PCE inflation up by 5.5% year-over-year when it is reported Thursday, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; There is also the ISM manufacturing survey reported Friday. The key nonfarm payrolls report will also run that day.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 460,000 jobs were added in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to the 678,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February and an unemployment rate of 3.8%.
*****
&gt; “I definitely think at this point that inflation data is much more meaningful than employment, in terms of the path of the economy,” said Ben Jeffery, vice president of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. Jobs will still matter, but the Federal Reserve has pivoted to focus more on combating inflation, while the economy is reaching maximum employment.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made that point when he spoke to economists Monday, saying the central bank would be willing to be more aggressive raising interest rates to battle inflation. Stocks initially sold off on his comments, amid fears the Fed could slow the economy or even bring on a recession.
*****
&gt; Since then, stocks moved higher, but interest rates have been galloping higher. The fed funds futures market has been pricing in 50-basis-point rate hikes — or 0.5% — in both May and June.
*****
&gt; ″[Nonfarm payrolls] will matter... I do think it’s probably going to be more a story of just how far the market is willing to press the 50-basis-point rate hike narrative, which is likely to be more pressing next week,” said Jeffery. “The excitement that once surrounded jobs is definitely less so at this point in the cycle.”
*****
&gt; In the bond market, Jeffery said investors will be watching Treasury auctions Monday and Tuesday, when the government issues $151 billion in 2-year, 5-year and 7-year notes.
*****
&gt; Rising oil prices have been driving inflation expectations higher, and the bond market is closely watching crude prices, as is the stock market. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 8.8% for the week, at $113.90 per barrel Friday.
*****
&gt; # Oil heats up
&gt; “It seems like oil north of $100 has some staying power,” BMO’s Jeffery said.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said the pattern between stocks and oil will continue to be important. When oil has spiked recently, stocks have weakened, he said. Meanwhile, when crude falls, stocks have been able to rally,
*****
&gt; “It seems like this week it was a bit more pronounced again when oil prices were rising pretty aggressively,” Arone said. “It’s got this interconnectedness to a few things — sentiment about the Ukraine conflict, how’s that going, inflation and ultimately how hawkish or dovish the Fed is going to be. I think it’s emerged as one of those binary proxies for these other elements in the market.”
*****
&gt; “It’s just a barometer for those other things — the Ukraine conflict, inflation and the Fed,” he said.
*****
&gt; Arone said as investors anticipate some sort of resolution that will end the conflict in Ukraine, but it’s not clear when. “The headlines coming out of Ukraine will continue to cause volatility,” he said. “At the margin, investors are gaining comfort with the likely outcome.”
*****
&gt; Arone said stock market fundamentals are better than some investors expect. When inflation rises, topline revenues can also go higher.
*****
&gt; “Everyone knows multiples have contracted, stocks have gotten cheaper, but one thing that’s gotten lost on investors is top-line revenues have this correlation with inflation,” he said. “Corporate profits and CPI [the consumer price index] are kind of connected. You have multiples contracting but earnings estimates are rising.”
*****
&gt; Arone said stocks are reasonably positioned and investors are getting more comfortable that there will be a favorable resolution to the war.
*****
&gt; “If we can get past the Ukraine conflict and some of the fears about the Fed and inflation, I think the fundamentals are okay,” he said.

&gt; # The Bull Market Turns Two

&gt; The bear market ended two years ago today and the subsequent bull market has clearly been an amazing ride. For some context, it was the fastest bull market to double ever, at just under 18 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Chart-1.png))**

&gt; Here’s where it ranks against the other bull markets that have doubled. You can see it is currently up 102%, making it the best bull market on its second birthday ever. 2009 was up 95%, coming in second.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-2.png))**

&gt; At the recent peak in early January, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up 114%, making it the seventh bull market to double. The annualized return of 53.4% shows just how explosive this move was off the lows and does imply some type of break could be warranted.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-3.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way to look at this bull market as it starts year three. Previous strong bull markets saw modest gains and really spent much of the third year consolidating the previous big gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-4.png))**

&gt; “As this bull market reaches the third year of life, investors need to remember that year three of bull markets tend to be a little tamer, with the larger gains happening in year one and two,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, out of the 11 bull markets since World War II, we found that three of them ended during year three, while the ones that didn’t end saw an average gain of only 5.2%.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, year three of bull markets have returned only 5.2% on average for the S&amp;P 500, versus first year gains of 41.8% and second year gains of 12.8%, while three bull markets outright ended in year three.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chart-5.png))**

&gt; We expect the bull market to continue, but some bumps in the road are normal. As the bull ages, year three could provide some of those bumps.

&gt; For more on the bull market turning two and what could happen next, please watch the latest LPL Market Signals podcast with Jeff Buchbinder and Ryan Detrick, as they break it all down.

&gt; # 5 Energy Stocks Reached ATHs

&gt; Energy stocks have roared higher since the beginning of 2022, gaining a whopping 38.8% in less than three months (as of yesterday's close). This comes on the back of sharp moves higher in crude, thus implying higher margins and increased bottom line earnings per share. During the pandemic, energy stocks were among the most hurt, as a reduction in travel and economic activity led to a crash in oil markets. Although the YTD gain is certainly substantial, investors that have held energy stocks since mid-2008 are still in the red. The energy sector ETF (XLE) is still 23.0% off of its high price since the turn of the century, which occurred in June of 2014. As you can see from the chart below, XLE has broken its long-term downtrend and is nearing a breakout above 2018 levels. To retest the high of the century, XLE would need to gain another 29.8%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-since-2000-graph-032522.png))**

&gt; On March 11th of this year, the relative strength reading of XLE vs the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since 2000 turned positive for the first time since COVID was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ratio has since turned negative, and the reading is currently -5.0 percentage points. The relative strength had moved continuously lower from its high in 2008 through early 2021, but the recent reversal higher is substantial.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/XLE-vs-SPY-RS-032522.png))**

&gt; Although Energy has been strong as of late, only five of the 63 Energy sector stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 have hit all time highs in 2022 (to be considered, the stock must have been trading for at least five years). The five stocks are ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Matador Resources (MTDR) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Below are the charts of these stocks since the turn of the century. The average stock on this list is up 41.3% on the year as of yesterday's close, which is only slightly greater than the performance of XLE.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Individual-charts-032522.png))**

&gt; Not all of the increase to bears came from bulls. As shown below, neutral sentiment fell from 30.2% down to 27.8%. That is only the lowest level since the end of February. While bullish and bearish sentiment are both over a full standard deviation away from their historical averages, neutral sentiment is much more inline with its own historical average. Whereas all weeks since the start of the survey has seen neutral sentiment average a reading of 31.4%, this week's reading was only a few percentage points away.

***** 

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Swing Double Digits

&gt; There's nothing like higher prices to cure investor blues, and the last week has been a perfect example of that. AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw a double-digit increase in the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish this week with that reading rising from 22.5% up to 32.8% and matching the highest level of optimism in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Those gains to bullish sentiment borrowed entirely from bears as the percentage of respondents reporting as pessimistic fell from nearly 50% of respondents down to 35.4%. The 14.4 percentage point decline marked the largest weekly decline in bearish sentiment since July 2010 when the reading had fallen by 19.27 percentage points. More recently, however, there have been a couple of other double-digit drops in bearish sentiment including a 12.3 percentage point decline in the first week of March and an 11.9 percentage point drop in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; Bears continue to outnumber bulls, but the margin has narrowed to the smallest degree since the first week of the year. The bull-bear spread has risen to -2.6 after leaping higher by 24.7 points week over week; the largest one-week increase in the number since October 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Looking at it another way, this week marked the first time since October 2019 that bullish sentiment rose by at least 10 percentage points while bearish sentiment fell by at least 10 percentage points in the same week. In the table below, we show each prior instance of simultaneous double-digit swings in bullish and bearish sentiment without another occurrence in the previous six months. As for how price action has responded to such swings in sentiment, the S&amp;P 500 has generally seen consistently positive performance in the months ahead, but only one week and one-month performance has been significantly stronger on an average or median basis than what has been the norm.

&gt; # Best Performers Since 3/14 Pivot

&gt; Early last week, the US equity market pivoted, gaining 1%+ for four consecutive days between last Tuesday and last Friday (3/15-3/18). Sentiment has shifted amongst the investing community for the time being. For now, it seems that the market may have largely priced in some of the most hawkish Fed tightening scenarios. Remember, we already saw huge drops of 50%, 60%, 70%, even 80%+ in many of the most interest-rate sensitive growth stocks before the Fed even lifted off of 0%. How much further were investors expecting them to go?

&gt; Since the 3/14 pivot, certain members of the S&amp;P 1500 have already gained over 20%, but still remain well off of 52-week highs. Of the top 35 performers since last Monday, the average stock is still 43.4% off of its 52-week highs (median: 47.1%). Although there is much recovery room left for many of these high-flyers, this is a move in the right direction. The top performing stock since the 3/14 close is GameStop (GME), which has moved 58.0% higher on the back of a 30.9% move today. This may imply that investors have increased their risk appetite, or that retail investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, which would likely apply to the broader market from a retail perspective. Selectquote (SLQT) and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rank immediately below GME, gaining 53.7% and 45.9% respectively. Both of these stocks are operating at a loss on the bottom line, which tells us that the risk-on trade has performed strongly over the last week. Other noteworthy names on the list include Tesla (TSLA), Avis Budget (CAR), Etsy (ETSY), NVIDIA (NVDA) and PayPal (PYPL).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/Best-perf-since-31422-032222.png))**

&gt; Breaking this down further, the sectors that help up strongly in the face of a downturn earlier this year have performed the worst since the 3/14 pivot. Utilities and Energy members of the S&amp;P 1500 have only gained 0.6% and 2.6% on average, respectively, since last Monday. On the other hand, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Technology members of the S&amp;P 1500 have gained 7.8%, 8.1% and 10.6% on average, respectively. Based on the data below, the sectors most off their highs have rallied the most aggressively since the pivot, while the sector leaders from pre-3/14 have lagged.

&gt; # Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since the COVID Crash Lows

&gt; Two years ago to the day, the S&amp;P 500 put in a low after a 33.9% pullback from the closing high on 2/19/20. While the S&amp;P 500 is once again off its highs, the index sits just over 100% above that 3/23/20, low and 32.7% above the pre-pandemic high. In the table below, we show the current S&amp;P 500 components which have rallied the most since the COVID Crash low as well as how much each stock declined during the crash.

&gt; While it was not a member of the S&amp;P 500 at the time of the COVID crash, being added on 12/21/20, Tesla (TSLA) is currently the S&amp;P 500 member which has risen the most since the broader market low. After being more than cut in half, it has since risen over 1,000%. The next best performers are Devon Energy (DVN) and APA Corp (APA); a couple of Energy sector names that saw even larger declines of 72.8% and 84.86%, respectively from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Along since Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), both stocks have risen well over 800% over the past two years. Of the list of the 25 best performers in the S&amp;P 500, the only one that managed to move higher during the COVID Crash was vaccine producer Moderna (MRNA) which had risen 40.43% as the rest of the market collapsed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032322-Best-vs-Worst-2a.png))**

&gt; By the time of the 3/23/20 low, the index's worst performers since the pre-pandemic high (2/19/20) had seen monumental declines with many of those stocks dropping over 70%. On the other end of the spectrum, only four stocks had eeked out a gain and only another seven stocks had fallen single-digit percentage points.

&gt; As for what those stocks have done since then, below we have created equal weight indices comprised of the S&amp;P 500 members that are still actively traded that were the 20 best and 20 worst performers from 2/19/20 to 3/23/20. Each basket as well as the S&amp;P 500 are indexed to 100 at the COVID Crash low. As shown, what had at one point been the most beaten-down names, have crushed it over the past two years; hypothetically having turned $100 into $481 having even held up well during the recent bout of weakness for equities. For comparison, the biggest winners in the early days of the pandemic bought at the lows would have only seen $100 turn into $137.64 while the S&amp;P 500 as a whole would have a little more than doubled.

&gt; # Jobless Claims at Lowest Level in Over 50 Years

&gt; Since early December, initial jobless claims have risen and remained above multi-decade lows. That is until this week. Seasonally adjusted claims fell for a second week in a row down to 187K this week. That is the lowest reading since claims came in at 182K all the way back in September 1969.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While not to take away from the historically strong reading as NSA claims also hit a new low for the pandemic of 181.1K, before seasonal adjustment, jobless claims have not exactly fallen to as significant of a low as the adjusted number. Although that is the lowest level for the current week of the year since 1969, there have been recent periods like the fall of 2018 and 2019 in which claims were even lower. Declines in initial claims have historically been common for the current week of the year, but the next couple of weeks have typically seen claims experience a brief bump before resuming a seasonal downtrend roughly through mid-spring.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/03/032422-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims have fallen even more consistently with week-over-week improvements in 7 of the past 10 weeks. Now at 1.35 million, continuing claims are down to the lowest level since the first week of 1970.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks:)",4
2416,stocks,"Everyone has some speculative, hard to justify gut feeling stocks in their portfolio. What are yours? Mine would be NKLA, A weed stock I guess I’m not allowed to name the ticker of but it’s the sun and a dial and HYLN. I can’t justify them with numbers and they make up 1% or less of my portfolio, but these are my Hail Mary plays. Show me what you got or give me some hate",4
2417,stocks,"I heard Charlie Munger say that three good companies is all you need for the rest of your life. Even if that's an over-simplification or too strict for your actual strategy, if you HAD to choose three stocks for the rest of your life, which would you pick?",4
2418,stocks,"  

A style factor is an isolated characteristic of a stock. There are variety of style factors: Growth, Value, Momentum, etc. They can get pretty niche, but we will focus on the well observed ones.

An example is the Value factor. To put it simply, Value factor methodology typically ranks a stock universe by P/E, P/B, dividend yield, and other fundamental metrics. The stocks that are in the bottom 20% of the ranking will then be considered “Value” factor stocks, since they are trading with such “undervalued” multiples relative to the market average. If S&amp;P 500 has a forward P/E of 15, and the bottom 20% of stocks have a multiple of 9, historically this has been considered “Value stocks” since they are so trading at such a discount to the weighted average of the market. A portfolio is then created that will hold these cheaper stocks.

There is a TON more that goes on under the hood, feel free to investigate various style factor methodologies if you wish to get into the weeds. But I’m hoping this is enough to make you feel moderately comfortable.

Now to the Momentum factor—the Momentum factor assumes that companies that have been trading higher will continue to do so in the near-term. “Near-term” is defined differently according to the ETF, it ranges from a few months to a year. Read the ETF methodology if you care to learn more.

A variety of research papers have found that the Momentum factor consistently delivers excess returns. According to MSCI, the Momentum factor generated an annualized excess return of 13% over MSCI World during a 40-yr period. Going back to 1986, Fidelity found an average annual 1.5% excess return over Russell 1000. Momentum's Sharpe ratio is on the more volatile than other common factors, so please keep this mind when opening a position.

There’s a plethora of academic research on the Momentum factor, so feel free to get more into the weeds yourself if you wish.

The largest Momentum ETF is MTUM, with $12 billion in AUM. There are tons of others. Do some due diligence and pick one if it suits your risk tolerance.

Happy Friday!

*(IMPORTANT caveat! This Value factor methodology I described has been argued to be a poor representation of Value. This methodology may have been a good way to screen for stocks decades ago, but IMO, most stocks in the lowest 20th percentile should be trading there. Value factor investing != Value investing. Please keep this mind when making buy/sell decisions.)*

*(2nd IMPORTANT caveat! For the pedants—I’m painting with fat ass brush in the above write-up. There are a million different methodologies to construct a factor portfolio, I realize that. I skipped over a ton and the odds of me mischaracterizing some part of the process is high, so focus on the spirit of what I’m describing.)*

2419,stocks,"I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030. From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs). They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.

Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology, although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame. Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.

2420,stocks,"They may not be the most exciting part of the securities markets, but CUSIP numbers are indispensable. 

The arcane nine-digit ID numbers, issued by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures, show up on everything from stocks, bonds, exchange-traded securities and mutual funds. They’re also not free. In at least two class-action lawsuits, investors are alleging that the cost of CUSIPs has been artificially inflated for decades, as a result of monopolistic control by data providers including the American Bankers Association, FactSet and S&amp;P Global.

Investors, who are seeking injunctions and damages, allege the CUSIP system’s owners and exclusive licensees aggressively sought to dampen competition from other services offering free or lower-cost alternatives.

“The motive for their exclusion of competition is simple,” says [one of the complaints](https://www.law360.com/articles/1470933/s-p-accused-of-monopolizing-use-of-securities-id-numbers) filed recently in Manhattan federal court, “CUSIPs are worthless except for the fact that they are the standard.”

## How the CUSIP system began

CUSIPs have been standard since the 1960s for identifying securities for clearing and settlement of trades. The system is owned by the ABA and a subsidiary of S&amp;P’s Global Market Intelligence, now called Factset Research Systems, which [completed its purchase](https://investor.factset.com/news-releases/news-release-details/factset-completes-acquisition-cusip-global-services) of the business from S&amp;P this month for $1.925 billion. 

The numbering system was originally a subscription service that provided physical books containing information on every financial instrument linked to a CUSIP and were updated quarterly or annually. But in the 1980s, vendors like Bloomberg began distributing the data directly and electronically to financial institutions, making it unnecessary to pay a fee to S&amp;P.

To counter the loss of revenue, S&amp;P changed its business model from a subscription service to a licensing one, and required financial firms using CUSIPs to pay substantial fees. S&amp;P inserted language in its contracts with data vendors requiring them to cut off access to the CUSIPs for any financial institution that did not enter into a license agreement with S&amp;P.

At about the same time, according to the lawsuits, ABA and S&amp;P became more aggressive in trying to maintain their stranglehold on the system.

“Monopolies are rarely good for business,” said Ronald J. Aranoff, a partner in the Litigation &amp; Dispute Resolution Group at Wollmuth Maher &amp; Deutsch LLC, which represents plaintiff Hildene Capital Management. “We trust the court to decide whether the exercise of monopoly power here was unlawful. We believe it is.”

## Flexing monopoly power

CUSIP was designated as a financial standard by a committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), dubbed X9. But X9 is hardly an independent body, at least according to the class action suits. The ABA established X9 during the 1970s and it, as well as S&amp;P’s CUSIP Global Services, are still connected to X9 through voting positions on the committee’s board of directors.

Hildene is an institutional asset manager headquartered in Stamford, Conn. Like all other investment managers and traders, it requires access to financial information for managing, monitoring, buying, and selling financial instruments. The company typically pays Bloomberg for access to data that includes CUSIP numbers. For Hildene, the cost of getting the data with CUSIP numbers ends up being about $10,500 a year.

“Hildene…\[is\] then left with two unenviable options: pay S&amp;P’s supracompetitive subscription rates or have CUSIP numbers stripped from their data feed and suffer, at a minimum, significant disruption to their businesses,” the lawsuit states.

2422,stocks,"Blue Orca Report -  [Blue+Orca+Short+Li-Cycle+Corp+(NYSE+LICY).pdf (squarespace.com)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a81b554be42d6b09e19fc09/t/623c64001d5d395dc27c523c/1648124930520/Blue+Orca+Short+Li-Cycle+Corp+%28NYSE+LICY%29.pdf)

&gt;Li-Cycle recognizes revenues using an Enron-like mark-to-model accounting gimmick. Li-Cycle recognizes revenues months prior to the actual sales of its recycled black mass, based on its own provisional estimate of the future value of the product. This accounting treatment is plainly vulnerable to abuse, giving Li-Cycle discretion over its reported revenues. We suspect that under this framework, Li-Cycle marks up the value of its receivables on unsold products and runs the gains through its revenue line. In the most recent quarter, we calculate that **45% of Li-Cycle’s revenues were derived from simply marking up receivables on products that had not been sold**.  
&gt;  
&gt;We suspect that such questionable accounting could explain why **Li-Cycle’s CFO and auditor resigned in January 2022**, mere months after the Company went public. Li-Cycle is a governance nightmare. Its founder is a serial penny stock promoter recently sanctioned by Canadian authorities and its management team **diverted half a million in shareholder money to enrich their entourage with wasteful spending, including tens of thousands of dollars on leather goods purchased from the CEO’s family**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Li-Cycle’s cash burn is so severe and far above previous guidance that analysts have already downgraded the stock and told the market to expect Li-Cycle to raise at least $1 billion through debt and dilutive equity issuances. By our calculation, Li-Cycle’s stated capital investments will require the Company to raise at least $1 billion – 102% of its current enterprise value – in large part by massively diluting current shareholders. We think Li-Cycle, which currently trades at 96.8x LTM revenues.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Chairman a Serial Penny Stock Promoter Recently Sanctioned by Canadian Regulators**. Li-Cycle’s co-founder and chairman, Tim Johnston, is a serial penny stock promotor who was recently banned by the TSX Venture exchange from acting as a director or officer of any TSXV-listed company without prior approval due to misconduct as president and CEO of Desert Lion Energy (DLI.CN). Johnston was sanctioned for failing to disclose key terms of a discounted financing he arranged for the junior miner. The British Columbia Securities Commission recently upheld the punishment. Undeterred, Johnston listed another lithium hype story on a junior Canadian exchange, which is down 62% from its highs and already admitted to overstating its cash balance.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Half a Million in Investor Money Diverted to Family Entourage**. Despite a business that is hemorrhaging cash, and which will require multiple near-term cash infusions, Li-Cycle diverted $529,902 in investor capital to the family entourage of its founders through a series of highly questionable related party payments. These payments include, $85,824 to a leather goods maker owned by the CEO’s family which makes wallets, toiletry bags and beer holsters. Li-Cycle also paid C$4,500 per month to lease part of a C$312,000 office from the CEO’s family, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a corporate video production company owned by the chairman’s brother and paid over $170,000 to a family owned “technology service” with three employees in India.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li-Cycle’s Revenues are based on Enron-esque Mark-to-Model Accounting**. Li-Cycle claims to sell 100% of its recycled black mass to an investor, Traxys, and recognizes revenues immediately upon delivery. But Traxys is not really a customer, it is merely a broker providing working capital financing to Li-Cycle while Traxys attempts to sell Li-Cycle’s black mass to end buyers. Traxys is not the end customer, it bears no commodity price risk, and charges Li-Cycle interest on any cash to the Company prior to final sale to the end buyer. Yet Li-Cycle somehow recognizes revenue immediately upon delivery to its brokers, months before any sale occurs. Li-Cycle’s revenues are based on its own provisional estimate of the value of its unsold recycled product. In our opinion, Li-Cycle’s accounting is reminiscent of Enron – as the Company’s revenues are not derived from bona fide sales of recycled product to end customers, but rather Li-Cycle’s estimates of the future value of such products. Li-Cycle in effect uses markto-model accounting, pulling sales forward from future periods and recognizing revenues based on its self-serving estimates of recycled product shipped to its brokers. Under this framework, Li-Cycle also bolsters reported revenues by marking up the value of receivables for black mass which sits at its brokers and has yet to be sold. In the most recent quarter, we calculate that 45% of Li-Cycle’s revenues were derived from simply marking up receivables on products that had not been sold. We question whether this highly aggressive accounting treatment caused Li-Cycle’s auditor and CFO to resign, both of whom abruptly left the Company following the end of the last fiscal year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li-Cycle Requires $1 Billion in Near Term Capital**. Li-Cycle’s costs and anticipated capital expenditures have ballooned. Morgan Stanley estimated in a recent note downgrading the stock that cost and capital expense overruns increased its estimate of Li-Cycle’s free cash flow burn (2022-2026) from $643 million to \~$1.85 billion, a 3x increase. Analysts estimate that Li-Cycle burns cash so much more rapidly than it initially told investors, that the Company will need to raise $1 billion in additional capital through debt and dilutive equity issuances. We agree. By our calculation, Li-Cycle’s proposed capital investments will require the Company to raise at least $1 billion – 102% of its current enterprise value – in part by diluting existing shareholders. This is fatal to the bull case for the stock: even if investors ignore Li-Cycle’s nightmarish corporate governance, questionable accounting, and negative margins, they will likely be so badly diluted that even if they win, they lose.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hiding Negative Gross Margins**. Notably for a self-styled ‘urban miner,’ Li-Cycle does not disclose gross margins on its income statement, instead reporting nebulous expense categories which on the surface, seem to imply an impressive 83% gross margin in the latest quarter. We think this is highly misleading, as the footnotes to the financial statements reveal that LiCycle’s aggregate inventory costs exceeded its aggregate revenues since inception. This suggests that Li-Cycle likely has negative gross margins, indicating that its recycling business is neither scalable nor economically viable. Rising commodity prices are unlikely to help, as the cost of Li-Cycle’s inputs will simply rise along with commodity prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Blood Diamonds and ESG**. Li-Cycle’s purported commitment to ESG is central to its narrative, a commitment which we believe is more of a marketing ploy than a guiding tenet. Li-Cycle’s advisor, major shareholder and company consultant owned a Tanzanian diamond mine which has been accused of appalling human rights abuses. We question how ESG investors will feel about the ESG credentials of a company with close ties to a group accused of profiting from blood diamonds.",4

My take (not a financial advisor):

Bottom line: Nobody knows anything.

I think Fed is way behind the curve and they eventually will have to aggressive and do more rate hikes and slow economy. However, I think recession is less likely due to strong labor market. We might revisit close to Feb-Mar lows but it might not happen until Apr-May when companies start to report Q2 earnings and next FOMC meeting. QQQ might reach to \~365 and SPY to \~455 before another correction happens.

 I also am down with a few ETF I bought:

* ESPO: -3,3% (-380€) Van Eck Video Games
* IS3N: -2,8% (-470€) MSCI EM

I definitely don't want to invest in the above mentioned stocks in the long run. I just thought that I could wait it out and sell as soon as I woukd be in the black figures again. But right now I am not that sure about it anymore.

With the XMLH and ESPO i feel more confident investing long term and would also like to keep them even if the XMLH looks pretty bad atm. I am pretty sure I want to get rid of the Rize ETF and for the case of IS3N I am completely indecisive. Originally I wanted the emerging market having a much higher share in my portfolio but right now I think I don't feel very comfortable with that. 

So like I mentioned in the question above I just don't know how to make the decision on when to cut losses. There might be a time when the stocks are not that much down but I feel waiting to long might also be wrong, especially because I could invest the money also in a better stock/ETF.",4

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I'm trying to do some research into the stock market of the early 1990s for a personal project of mine. I tried to google various questions but all i get are reports of the market and other various news from the time.

I have read that an online communication system was introduced around 1975, and that buying over phone was a large practice before the stock market crash - wherein priority was introduced for smaller tradings.

What i'm specifically looking for though, is *how* someone would buy/sell stocks in 1991-1997. Would it be over the phone, using one of a few regulated websites, etc?

Another related question - could people in other countries, like England, purchase American stocks back in the early 90s?",4
2443,stocks,"Last weekend, Mary and I went to Beverly Hills to visit her good friend, a wealthy lady, Jenny. Their villas are worth around 25M and are very luxurious. Jenny was nice to us and let the maid prepare coffee, fruit and snacks for us.

After talking about work, Mary hopes that Jenny can provide some advice on investment and financial management. Jenny is also very refreshing. So we talked for the next 3 hours and then Jenny invited us to dinner.

At first, Jenny said, her husband gave her 2M and asked a surrogate to help.

Later, the agent provided Jenny with several plans, and Jenny conducted various investigations. The final scheme is a 5:3:2 scheme.

Its content is roughly:

1. Jenny selected 3 start-up technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area for investment, accounting for 50% of the funds;

2. Jenny invests in stocks of growth technology companies, accounting for 30% of the funds;

3. Jenny has invested in stocks of large companies, including stocks of Internet communication technology, biotechnology, and consumer companies, accounting for 20% of the capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Six years later, one of the start-up tech companies Jenny invested in the San Francisco Bay Area is doing very well, and the stock price has performed very well after going public. Jenny received $15 million through this investment. About half of the remaining 30% and 20% are relatively profitable, some are moderately profitable, and some are losing investments. But overall, Jenny's total market value is around 20 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Jenny's broker is a private wealth advisor and is very professional.

This is the best investment plan I have ever seen. What kind of investment solutions have you seen?",4

Most of these posts make the assumption that revenue growth implies higher future returns. I think that is at best a major leap of faith and at worst a dangerous mistake.

From my vantage point, there are two ways to argue for the over-performance of a sector or an individual equity. Either it’s undervalued, in which case you’re arguing for higher risk-adjusted returns — alpha. Or it’s riskier than the broader market in a way that is correlated with other prevailing risk factors and thus robust to diversification. In this case, your arguing for higher returns to compensate for the asset’s risk-elevating contribution to a diversified portfolio.

While it's true Roku is a growth stock and many are getting hit, it seems pretty difficult to justify, going from it's high of almost $500 to now around $125. Financially, they are making money, and exceeding their EPS, actually quite significantly. Only bearish argument I can think of is being a covid pandemic stock, but even then, people are still watching shows, which makes it difficult as mentioned to justify, such a price difference. 

Does anyone who holds or contemplated or even simply researched Roku have a bullish or in this case bearish argument to explain what's happening? Would you say it's a buy?",4

2453,stocks,"So some pretty big news came out today regarding the semi-conductor industry. As we are probably all aware there is a chip shortage going on and Intel is investing billions into factories to build these chips. As of right now Intel has 4 confirmed customers which are Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and Qualcomm. They said in the past they are in talks with more companies but nothing was confirmed so they weren’t releasing anything. Today basically confirmed that one of the companies they are in talks with is Nvidia.

Nvidia CEO was questioned about Intels Foundry Service. He said ""Our strategy is to expand our supply base with diversity and redundancy at every single layer. At the chip layer, at the substrate layer, the system layer, at every single layer. We've diversified the number of nodes, we've diversified the number of foundries, and Intel is an excellent partner of ours[…]. They're interested in us using their foundries, and we're very interested in exploring it,"" said Huang. Here is the whole article if you want to read it.

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-in-talks-with-intel-foundry-intel-and-amd-know-all-our-secrets

Now this didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me considering Intel and Nvidia are direct competitors to each other. Especially as of this year when Intel released their GPU Intel ARC. 

I think what this mainly shows is just how bad the chip shortage is right now and how desperate companies are to get their chips manufactured so they can release their products. As of right now there is really no confirmed end in sight for the shortage and it will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few years.

2454,stocks,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again? Have the fundamentals of the business improved so much that it offsets the heightened economic risks? I genuinely don't understand what's so attractive about this stock.",4

My big question is would I get more contracts to make up for the difference as well since it's 20:1 split? My 100 potential shares for that option contract would then become 2000 potential shares during the split so for it to be adjusted correctly, they would have to adjust the amount of contracts as well, right?

Do not trust your account holders to track your holdings accurately. 

Do not trust them to maintain historical records. 

Twice, in my 30+ years of investing, I have had to demand corrections to my 401k account from a former job. 

Both had to do with the vested % of employer contributions somehow being set back to zero (from 60%). 

The first time, since it was the old days, I had the paper docs in a file. They agreed quickly on the error and fixed it. 

The second time, five years ago, I relied on the electronic records through the the T. Rowe Price site, and found them to be inadequate. It was eventually fixed, but that was a lot of frustration. 

Now that I think about it, my record keeping of marital accounts which were not in my name would have come in handy in my divorce. That cost me some $.

I want to pitch you guys with an investment opportunity. But please remember to do your own due diligence. Let me know if I've gotten anything wrong. I want to avoid providing a biased pitch, so I'd shy from giving my assumptions.

Ok, here we go.

* Discovery is merging with Warner bros, which is set to close Q2 2022. We don't know the date, but has already obtained all anti-trust and regulatory authority approvals.
* Discovery Warner bro joint company is set to generate $52bn revenue on pro forma basis, which puts it the number #1 streaming platform compared to $NFLX &amp; $DIS.
* Discovery is a profitable yet boring company. Sure, many of you have come across very profitable companies with declining future profitability prospects therefore depressed valuations e.g., Altria, KHC, KO, etc.
* Discovery generates approximately $2bn in free cash flow at $14bn valuation. Growing revenue and cost at GDP and work backward on a DCF model, market implied perpetual growth rate is only -1%. Yes, the market is pricing the company in steady decline for -1% every year despite the company generated 14% top line improvement last year.
* Discovery and Warner bros merger will create the deepest library content for streaming platform in the market. Management already said the joint company will join their streaming application into one, meaning combining IPs such as Suicide Squad, Peace maker, Food channel, etc.
* Discovery is also one of the very few streaming platform offering sports entertainment including NHL, NCAA, Olympics, etc.
* Qualitative aside. Let's talk valuations. The company is currently trading 1x 2023 forward EV/Sales compared to 2.5x $DIS and 4.5x $NFLX.
* A slight multiple re-rate to 2x on pro forma basis already brings your investment 2x at today's valuation. I know I said no assumptions for me, but if I have to give my target, I have a rule of thumb for top contender trading 75% of market leader multiple, so that's roughly 3.3x. Or if worst case scenario, if it just trades close but lower to $DIS, you still get over 100% return on the investment. This is one of the least followed company on Fitwit and I believe there are some mispricing remains.
* Two reasons why the mis-pricing exist today. 1) there's still no set date on merger schedule despite approvals have been obtained from regulatory body and the board. 2) Discovery has yet to provide on post merger share translation information. There's a very informative article on Seeking alpha by Livy research that gives an estimate on a likely scenario on shares translation on the joint company. I will refrain from providing link because there's a rule against seeking alpha on reddit (I think?).

Down the road, Nikola plans to produce a truck powered by hydrogen gas and hydrogen fuel cells that will be able to compete in long-haul trucking markets. A traditional semi truck rolling down the highway can travel up to 2,000 miles on a single fill-up. Trucks get about six to seven miles per gallon, and two fuel tanks can hold up as much as 300 gallons of diesel. 
The company expects to build 300 to 500 trucks in 2022. Tre deliveries are expected to begin in the U.S. in the second quarter. European deliveries will follow in the third quarter.

Orders for U.S durable goods — products meant to last at least three years — shrank for the first time in five months, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast 1% decline.

The dropoff was concentrated in passenger planes and autos, two volatile categories that can swing sharply from one month to the next. Yet bookings were soft in every major category except for computers. A more accurate measure of demand, known as core orders, slipped 0.3% in the month. The core number strips out transportation and military hardware. It was first decline in 12 months.

**Big picture:** Businesses still have plenty of demand for big-ticket items despite high inflation and disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Orders for durable goods have climbed 10% over the past year. Headwinds are growing, however.

The conflict in Ukraine could tax already strained global supply chains, as could a coronavirus outbreak in China. At home, the Federal Reserve is moving to raise interest rates to try to bring down high inflation.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus. [Highland estimated that a single bus generated roughly $10,000 for the company over the course of the summer](https://environmentnorthcarolinacenter.org/sites/environment/files/reports/NC_V2G%202022%20scrn.pdf#NC_V2G%202022.indd%3A11654) performing V2G. Highland will finance the purchase of the electric bus fleet, charge the Jouley bus overnight when cost is cheapest, [have the school districts pay on subscriptions for just the miles driven](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/03/21/sbaas-model-brings-electric-school-buses-to-more-districts/), then sell the leftover energy back to the grid during peak hours when the cost is highest. Highland would take care of all maintenance and charging infrastructure. Highland Electric is a company that was created for the sole purpose of commercializing V2G in electric school buses. It's doing this for profit. The result came back so promising that it resulted in them opening their order book for more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is this important:**

Having a working business model where it is profitable to buy an electric school bus vs diesel is a game changer. An electric school bus is no longer viewed as just a novelty transport but as a stack of 16 Tesla Powerwalls that just happen to also earn transport income. Cost has always been the biggest hurdle in transitioning from 480,000 diesel school buses to electric. Electric school bus is often priced $120,000-$200,000 higher than its comparable diesel school bus. I'm fully aware of the few billions in funding for new electric school buses in a use-it-or-lose-it mandate and the touted $10,000 or so per year savings on fuel and maintenance. But unless the upfront cost comes down to the same level as diesel, I don't see many of those diesel getting phased out to electric. Having companies like Highland Electric take on the upfront cost and the associated long term risk would get transition to electric sped up and on a massive scale. The fact that Highland found long term, V2G not only make up the difference in $120,000-$200,000 cost difference but actually turning a profit from it is extremely intriguing. Now, for the same amount of money, school districts can get 3 electric school buses instead of 1 by having Highland maximizing the full potential of these powerful batteries instead of having them waste away in the parking lot in down time.

**More companies want in on V2G:**

Aside from Thomas Built Buses long-term partnership using Proterra's 226kWH battery and drivetrain with Highland Electric, a number of other companies are taking advantage of the working V2G &amp; electric school bus model.

\- Dominion Energy selected Thomas Built's Jouley electric bus with its 226 kWh Proterra battery for V2G ([source](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10133648/bus-electrification-partnership-to-drive-cost-savings-cleaner-air)). Dominion plans to add 200 buses per years for the next 5 years.

\- On a smaller scale, Alaskan Energy and DTE Energy both selected the Jouley electric bus to study and obtain their own data on V2G.

\- Blue Bird will provide Nuvve with electric school bus equipped with 155 kWh battery ([source](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/20/nuvve-and-blue-bird-combine-to-create-electric-school-buses-that-are-v2g-enabled/))

\- BYD just released a small electric school bus with 150 kWh battery with V2G tech but no partners yet([source](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a38952770/byd-electric-school-bus-v2g-charging/)). BYD might have a difficult time getting partners as BYD is being blacklisted by US government from using tax money.

**Minimal battery degradation from V2G over 10 years:**

""In the case of frequency regulation and peak load shaving V2G grid services offered 2 hours each day, battery wear remains minimal even if this grid service is offered every day over the vehicle lifetime.""

""Frequency regulation and peak load shaving at power rates typical for vehicle charging and discharging will not significantly accelerate battery degradation in comparison to the degradation incurred from driving and calendar aging. Even in the ”extreme” cases in which we assume all EVs provide grid services from 7:00pm-9:00pm every day for ten years, the capacity losses from frequency regulation and peak load shaving only increase by 3.62% and 5.6%, respectively.""

**FYI for potential investors:**

\- Proterra (PTRA) produces battery and drivetrain for Thomas Built Buses as well as other heavy-duty commercial companies. Proterra will have its 3rd and massive 327,000 square foot EV battery factory up and running in the 2nd half of 2022. Proterra also builds electric transit buses.

\- Thomas Built Buses is the oldest American bus manufacturer and is owned by Daimler. Daimler Truck is an investor in Proterra.

\- Lion Electric (LEV) is a Canadian company and it builds electric school buses among other large commercial vehicles.  Lion Electric will have its new $70 million US manufacturing plant completed late 2022.

\- Nuvve (NVVE) specializes in V2G platform and is more of an EV charging company.

The size of the pie(480,000) is so large that no single company can eat it all. Even if everyone gets just 1% of that pie or 4,800 school buses, at [$500/kWh](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-12-03977/article_deploy/sustainability-12-03977.pdf) average price for battery and a 226 kWH battery, a company like Proterra would be looking at revenue of $542M for the battery alone. Proterra already [locked up](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/proterra-lg-partner-on-ev-battery-cells/) a stable supply of high-grade Nickel battery cells with LG Energy Solution through 2028.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I believe the fact that our electricity infrastructure being far from perfect is what makes V2G profitable. I'm excited at the potential of V2G opening the door to a massive and untapped market of electrification of 480,000 school buses.",4

I'd like to start learning more about the investing industry in Iran.

What I'm looking for is Telegram channels (I hear it's the most popular method of communication) on stock trading/investing - mainly based on Iranian stocks, not foreign ones.

In addition to this, if anyone has any suggestions on how I can better my research or other places I can look. Or maybe someone would like to chat about this or tell me someone who I could contact.

I'm also aware most channels will be in Farsi, and as I don't speak Farsi, that may seem like an issue - but I will translate these and hire a translator if necessary i.e messages are lost in translation.

Thanks very much!",4
2496,stocks,"One of the hardest lessons I've learned in the markets is to resist the temptation to make decisions based on what I want to happen, or what I think will happen, and instead follow what is actually happening. The easiest way to do that is to develop a strategy and stick to it when the signals pop up, regardless of what's in the headlines. Someone recently turned me on to the Heikin-Ashi weekly chart as a signal for going long, and it has a remarkable track record for identifying lows after pullbacks. Try it yourself - call up a chart of any major index and switch it to Heikin-Ashi candlesticks on a weekly time frame. The signal is amazingly simple: go long (or add to an existing position) whenever the chart displays a bullish weekly candle following a downtrend.

Unless something changes and we see a major end-of-week selloff, there is a buy signal setting up for the major indices this week.",4
2497,stocks,"ZIM is  shipping company that is massively undervalued. It’s current P/E is 2.00 in an industry that usually trades with a P/E of 4.65 with some of the biggest names all above 5.0.  Historically this industry has traded at a P/E of 16.1 but it’s not expected that these shipping container rates will stay sky high for the next 5 years (more like 1-2) so some of that long term expectation is being accounted for. Regardless ZIM is undervalued and growing faster than it’s peers as next quarters earnings expectations show. In early May ZIM is expecting earnings per share of 12.54 vs last years 5.17 for an yoy earnings growth of 143%.

I expect this stock to flirt with $100 by next ER and should break $120 this year. Add to that some juicy dividends along the way and this is a nice stock to jump into. Let’s all make some money. Good luck and of course this is not financial advice.",4
2498,stocks,"I think I get it how prices of individual stocks are set during a trading session: there's bid and there's ask, people sell to other people willing to pay the asked price. That's pretty straightforward. Now, an ETF is a bundle of stocks. Nobody own ""pieces"" of an ETF, its prices is dictated by the prices of the stocks in its composition, right? Nobody is buying or selling VOO, there isn't a supply of VOO stocks somewhere, people are buying and selling Apple and Microsoft individual shares and that dynamic dictates the price movement of an ETF. Am I getting this right?

Now, what about VUAA.DE, an ETF traded in Germany that follows S&amp;P 500? When the German stock market opens, the US stock market is closed. What moves the price of VUAA.DE then, since no one is trading Apple and Microsoft shares at 09:00 UTC.",4
