But ever since around 2011 I stepped into the multiplayer universe of gaming. Playing with friends or competitive games even very cool Co-op games. I only finished 3 single player games since 2011, Wolf among us, tales from borderlands and darkness 2, anytime I try to play one now I just play it for 20-40 min and I zone out or get bored or lonely even? and I quit. Even some games I was so hyped for, like Sekiro or God Of War I just seem to get bored or lonely and quit. I don't know why this happens, I don't know if I can't be alone while gaming anymore, I just wish I had an answer or at least people I can relate to the same problem. :("

So I was wondering what should be my next game on switch. Saw that some Final Fantasy games released but I never played one before. Though I know VII and IX are some of the most famous. But I don't know anything about them cause I had only Nintendo consoles as a kid.

But if you have any good suggestions I'm all ears


My games:

- Civilization VI

- Pokémon let's go evee

- binding of isaac

- overcooked 2

- Mario odyssey

- Mario kart

- tricky tower

- Mario Kingdom battle

- South Park (both)

- super smash bros

- beholder

- 60 seconds

- stardew valley

- the escapists

- undertale

- dead cells


So yeah... A lot of casual games. But I like almost all games. Except FPS. I really suck at them.

Any idea? "

gaming,"Hey guys,

The dreaded announcement came, Borderlands 3 will be Epic Games Store Exclusive for 6 months. Still better than other games' exclusivity deals, but it further proves that publishers and developers don't care about us, customers. 
 
We all know that the Borderlands games are amazing, but this is the only way we can show that we want to enjoy the series on the same DRM. Borderlands GOTY will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns the game on Steam, so it really baffles me why can't they just release Borderlands 3 on Steam as well as EGS. Does Epic's exclusivity deal really worth that much that they are ready to upset tons of fans? 
 
Anyways, this is a call to arms. Please leave a negative Steam review on any Borderlands game you own (Borderlands GOTY re-release would suffer the most IMO) while also mentioning Epic's shady dealings and crappy exclusivity deals. 
 
We must show that we want Epic's exclusivity bullshit to be over. Thanks for everyone who takes part! "

We all have a say, and that say is whether we as consumers decide to play along with Take Two's incredibly disappointing decision, or whether we let them know that they've shot themselves in the foot. 

Vote with your dollars. Enjoy the game on consoles, but don't buy it on PC until the Steam launch in April 2020 if you're disappointed in the Epic exclusivity deal."

I don’t expect everyone to agree with me, but more and more when I buy a game developed in NA or EU, I am simply disappointed with the lack of content, sometimes the gameplay, but ultimately the real goal behind production.

More often than not, that goal tends to be the money. I don’t feel like the gaming industry has ever been as greedy as it is today. Some of the best games, and genres came from someone fucking around with a map or a game for themselves and their friends. Usually that meant it was also free. A few notable examples are Dota and Dota 2 spawning from Warcraft 3, CS:GO from Half-Life, DayZ from ArmA 2, and the Battlefront games developed after the Star Wars Galactic Warfare mod was created for CoD.

Gaming companies used to be all about the player experience, and mods like Dota would start careers instead of lawsuits. So what changed? I think the top executives in the field no longer care about the players, and their greed is ruining our safe haven from the political bullshit that is the real world.

I think the gaming industry is heading down the exact same path as the rest of the entertainment industry, and no one is trying to stop any of it. I try to compare all these games that are getting rereleased with updated graphics and no new content, to songs being covered by new popular artists, and movies being reproduced with new CGI tech. We just let them sell us the same shit with new packaging and now they think it’s okay because we keep buying it.

BioWare and EA had a real opportunity to create something new with Anthem, but EA went and fucked that up too, and for what, money? Now EA will just have to make a “new” fifa game (literally they’re all just reskins anymore) to make back their loss, and while Andrew Wilson rolls around in his cash, he’ll let BioWare rot for trying to create something new because he wouldn’t allocate them enough time or resources.

I don’t really know how to fix the industry, but I think the first step is smaller companies leaving EA and Activision-Blizzard. On the vast majority of projects, these companies no longer share the visions of their subsidiaries, and are causing the collapse of so many games by rushing the programming teams, and expecting perfection under a crunch. Bungie made the best decision leaving Activision and I hope more companies follow suit. "

I have a disability that would make it hard to cope with some of the businesses practices of gaming companies, including crunch and long hours. I can’t say I don’t have dreams of making a lot of money in the field, and I try to balance that with realistic expectations of how I can work. 

I really enjoy the coding classes I’m in, and the art is hard but that’s ok. However, I don’t really know how to build a portfolio and get hired by a company that can use me. Also, the disability I have can really mess with my work life, and I’m not considering working with a large developer for that reason.

We got plenty of reasons not to use EGS (hopefully you've done your research).  
But the fact is, no matter what, they end up winning, and we, concerned costumers, end up losing.

  
\-  Buy it on console first then steam later.  Great, 2 sales for them!  
\-  Pirate it then buy it on steam later. A late sale, great!  
\-  Wait for Steam. A late sale, great! Plus a few million bucks from Epic!  
\-  Pirate it. Congratulations, you're actively making the industry worse! (It'll never reach a large scale anyway)

gaming,"I'm going to take flak for this, fine.

&amp;#x200B;

So as most of you will know by now the Borderlands 3 official announcement trailer launched a few hours ago and most of the comments are people complaining about it being a timed Epic exclusive, fine, I get that some people will want to wait until it is on Steam and I understand that. But the people calling for piracy? Fuck that. This is a game we've been waiting 5 years for, hundreds of people put in minimum 40 hours for weeks on end, but the fact that it is a platform exclusive now suddenly means you can steal that effort away from them? I know most of you will say ""Oh well I'll pay for it when it releases on Steam"" and let's be honest, most of you won't.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the anger with Metro, that was scummy to allow people to buy on Steam and then yank that away from them. I can understand it to a degree with the Outer Worlds, since that was announced on Steam initially but without a release date, and is now also a timed exclusive. But with BL3 it was just an expectation, they never even hinted at a Steam release and maybe people expect it to be a no-brainer but still.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I get it, the Epic Store has issues right now. But guess what, so did Steam, Origin, Battlenet, Uplay, etc on launch. Why are we expecting the platform to be perfect on launch? Platforms take time to grow, people hated Steam on launch, same with the other mentioned platforms, but they got better with time. The same will happen with EGS, and they'll add features and make it better as time goes because that's how the software development cycle works.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of our monopolistic overlords Steam, let's see what they offer. Yes it is currently great for consumers (well sort of, I'll get to that) but how is it for developers and publishers? Well, for 30% (roughly, exact numbers are never published) I get to put my game up with the following great titles:

* [Gachi Heroes (NSFW)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/944220/Gachi_Heroes/)
* [Bala na manga](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945390/Bala_na_manga/)
* [Second Chance (NSFW)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/958720/Second_Chance/)
* [Fat Prisoner Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1037560/Fat_Prisoner_Simulator/)
* [Potatoman Seeks the Troof](https://store.steampowered.com/app/328500/Potatoman_Seeks_the_Troof/)
* [Who is this man?](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1008510/Who_Is_This_Man/)
* [FEMINAZI: The triggering](https://store.steampowered.com/app/585550/FEMINAZI_The_Triggering/)

Now I will be fair and say these are cherry picked examples but the reason why I've picked them is because these have all shown up in my daily queue because of some inane shit like being tagged with ""Action"" or ""Indie"". This is not the type of shit I expect to see on what is supposed to be the premium platform on PC. Yes I could hide adult content, but that doesn't filter out the other garbage. These aren't even games I'd expect to see free on [itch.io](https://itch.io) yet here they are on steam being charged a premium, and the crap keeps piling up every day. What same developer wants their games on a platform that actively promotes titles that were made in MS paint, asset flips from the Unity Store, hentai visual novels, and it just gets worse everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Then on the other hand you have Epic only taking 12%, and further cutting costs for Unreal Devs (BL3, most likely Outer Worlds) by removing engine licensing costs. And their platform is not filled with garbage. There is actual curation on the platform, the titles on there are hand picked and guaranteed to have a level of quality you can't expect on Steam. Is the platform as great as Steam? No, not even close. But neither was Steam when it launched. But people will happily play other exclusives on platforms that aren't as great as Steam, and they don't have a piracy fueled fit while they're at it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I might be a bit biased as a software developer who thinks the devs and publisher deserve to be paid for their hard work, and as a hobbyist indie dev who just wants to see things getting better for said devs, but it's not going to happen when people are so complicit with a monopolistic platform so content to be the Florida or Walmart of the gaming industry. I'd understand if you rather just wait until it hits steam, but please stop with this piracy shit and at least give the platform a chance to grow. "

Let us all look at a big list of things that Steam offers its developers for ***free*** that everyone seems to forget about and take for granted: [https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home)

Again, Steam isn't just a store, it is an ecosystem.  There is a reason that a bigger cut should be acceptable, and most people don't realize why that is the case.  Steam isn't just being greedy (they still are a business), but they actually at least offer a lot of tools to make a developer's game successful.  Steam offer these services which are free to developers, but to themselves still have to pay and maintain.  Asking for more of a cut to cover those extra costs shouldn't be a mind-blowing ask."

When I get free time I really want to play something, but I never do. I spend most of the time just looking at it all, the game cases and the games installed, and I never start playing.

I keep going over and over in my head, bahh maybe this one.. Nah its got too many quests, or maybe this one.. Nah its a racing game same thing over and over.. Or this one... Nah its an online FPS the kids will school me and ill quit after 5 mins anyway.

I just feel there's way too many games.. There's like.. There must be over a million active new or recently released games to play (let's say the past 5 years).

I can't bring myself to pick one. Every single game has its pros and cons and I don't have the mental energy to deal with any kind of con at all.

So yeah.. I classify myself as a gamer but the last time I touched something for longer than an hour was 4 months ago. Longer than 2 hours? 1 year ago. 8+ hours a day? Maybe back in 2015 when I was playing metroid prime on the Wii U. 16 hours a day? 2009 wow burning crusade.

I do the same thing on my phone. I install stuff I previously bought.. Thinking yeah.. I can play that at least.. Simple tap tap phone game, how hard could that be. Still no. They sit there... I gaze at them... And then I go on reddit, and type this.

Maybe I should just sell it all. 25 years of game and console collection.. Just flip the whole lot. I got like 120 ps one games... When the hell am I ever gonna play those again? I doubt I will.

But that's what kills me... I want to play something. But i just can't."

Epic Games want their platform, Epic Store, to compete with Steam. Instead of making their platform good, they have opted to do exclusivity deals to force people into using their store just to play the games they want. 
Epic Store just isn't any form of good competition. You put pressure on a monopoly by putting a strong competitor out there that challenges the shortcomings of the competitor, not by doing underhanded deals to gain an edge while producing a sub par product that is intended to counter the monopoly.

Let 2K know that holding your favorite franchise or games hostage won't fly. Tell them you won't buy it, and if they don't correct their course of action, then don't. Don't reward them for this disgusting behaviour."
gaming,"Seeing by redditors about how games today cost so much to produce (and seeing someone quote Modern Warfare 2 took about $100M to make) and also having started a replay of Shenmue and doing a few matches with friends on the original N64 GoldenEye, I was inspired to make this.

When I read about how Shenmue set the bar the most expensive game of all time to develop for quite some time, it makes me look at some of the big productions of its time. Each Lord of the Rings movie costs more than $100M to make individually and many medium sized production movies during the same period were around $50M range (and unknown smaller dsized big films still took around $10-30 million to shoot)......... It makes me wonder why gaming took quite along time to reach the production costs of other mediums in particular movies and TV?

I mean GoldenEye is frequently hyped as making more money than the already popular movie it came from. However it only took $2,000,000 to produce compared to the $60,000,000 budget of its movie. While Modern Warfare 2's 100 Million is big $$$ no matter what medium, in Hollywood standards its just standard fare for epic films. I mean big flops no one watches today such as The 2004 Alamo and Oliver Stone's Alexander used that range and beloved classics like Titanic commonly reach 200M+ range. Shenmue was basically the size of a moderately budget expected-to-be -a -hit brainless action flick such as Congo.

This fascinates me since the media in recently years and many gamers esp on reddit often hype how the gaming industry makes much more money than movies, music, and TV does in a year.

To put into comparison a typical Walking Dead episode costs $3 million to make and a recent Game of Throne episodes are starting to exceed $10M per episode (and at the start of GOT it took 6M per episode when it just started airing). The first Hobbit movie alone cost over $300 M.

Even in much cheaper mediums comparatively games take less. A typical comic book series takes thousands to srtart production to produce the equivalent of a one year subscription. A single one shot manga story publication takes hundreds, While today you can develop a great game with descent graphics and story, etc for less than $100. Hell mods that can be the size and quality of real published games with entire campaigns, voice acting,multiplayer modes, etchave been produced costing nothing.

While trying to make even a low budget TV show cartoon can reach $100 grand an episode and theater have to charge $10 minimal for an amateur high school play just to break even.

Why does gaming fall so far behind in production costs despite making more than other mediums?"

gaming,"How come all mmo's are just reskinned variations of world of warcraft and other games of its era ?

Battlefields and cods and such are the same with gimmics and upgraded graphics but still about the same?

How come there havent been much new innovation in the scale and depth other than looks ? 

If i were told back around the times of the release of swg and wow that gaming wont change much other than graphically, i wouldv laughed and said they must be wrong..
The progress there was made in around those 5 years were amazing! 
The only game that seems to promise something new and innovative is star citizen and its a crowdfunded game (im personaly backing it much for pushing gaming overall forward), it seems to be the only upcoming game with a scale never seen before, a true next gen game IF it makes it, and eventho its been going forward, it still can fail... 

How come big gaming corporations like bliz/ea and others aint pushing gaming to the next level overall, but seems to be stuck

gaming,I'm so sorry everybody.
gaming,"I'd much prefer The new Borderlands game to be on Steam at release. And I'm still on the fence about buying it right away or waiting for Steam when the time comes.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if any of you don't know, Steam takes 30% of a game's profits for themselves when sold on Steam. Though, I do think this number shrinks down to 20% if the game is popular enough with it's sales.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic takes 12% of the game's profits and if games use the Unreal Engine, then it they cover the 5% engine royalty from their 12% cut.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to make this post in order to show people that the Developers making the decision to sell their game on Epic over Steam doesn't make them evil or assholes. It makes them using a competitor's platform instead of the one that had in a way, a ""monopoly"" as the storefront for games in our minds. And competition is always good for the consumer. And in this case, it's good for the developers as well.

&amp;#x200B;

And if Epic is offering fuck-loads of money to developers to put their games on their store front along with the way less of a cut from the game's sales, then this is a huge fucking push and maybe Steam will change some things for the good in order to combat it. That's what this competition can bring.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, don't get me wrong, I DO think Steam has a better user experience than the Epic Store. But, that doesn't mean I want it to have a magical shield to ACTUAL competition in the gaming platform race."

gaming,"The main problems most people have with the Epic store and their exclusives fall into a few categories. Here I will take a moment to compile and assess the issues and provide some insight to the controversy.

1] The Epic Game Store is a blatant power move that undermines the PC market without addressing the root of the issues facing developers. The biggest issue here is that developers are attracted to the better revenue split (80-20 vs 70-30) that the Epic Store offers. While this is understandable on the developers part, and it is admirable that Epic is trying to make a more equitable distribution platform, it is undermining the PC market by doing so without addressing the issue openly with the public and it's competition directly.

2] A new launcher and game store were inevitable, but the EGS was poorly planned, and it's exclusives are disruptive to general consumer freedoms. I don't really have anything against Epic launching their own store, and I see many others who are similarly undisturbed by it. The problem is that as consumers, we want the freedom to buy our games from the platform that we prefer and not be forced to download something new to play the games we want. The choice should be ours to make whether we want to support the EGS or stick with Steam, not the devs or the executives.

3] Exclusive game deals, even timed deals, often are only beneficial in the short term, and will often hurt the developers in the long run. While the better revenue split is more appealing, and will make them more money conditionally, the deal doesn't take into account the sheer volume of a sales that could be made by releasing in all platforms simultaneously, as opposed to withholding from consumers who would otherwise have bought their product on launch. By making deals that their customer bases find unfavorable they're ultimately delaying themselves revenue at best, denying it at worst.

4] In the court of public opinion, reasons are trumped by opinions. All most people are going to care about in the long run is that they are being inconvenienced and forced to make choices they would rather not have to make. I would much rather see the game developers and publishers negotiate with Valve to solve the revenue split dispute first, then go with Epic as a an alternative if no deal could be struck. Jumping on the bandwagon of a ""beter"" option seems too greedy and short term to be a calculated move. It's a knee jerk financial decision that doesn't really benefit anyone, and consumers can smell it like the rotting garbage it is from a mile away.

TL;DR - This whole thing reeks of poor financial planning on just about everyone's part and Epic seems like a bunch of douche canoes for trying to cut Valve's legs out from under them without even thinking about how consumer would react. Just a bunch of greed and players hate it."

Now my family knows he for never asking for much at all for my b days because I want them to save their money instead of getting me stuff. Well.. it’s my 21st and my mom is going to be in Colorado and she loves me to death and hates the fact she ain’t see me on my birthday and wants to get me something special for my 21st. She’s apparently splitting the cost with my gf and I have tried telling them no but they won’t take it. They said I have a choice and if I don’t make a decision they’ll surprise me with one of the Two. Only problem with both is that there aren’t many games I see that I’m afraid I’ll like but I’m super interested in them. For switch I like portable gaming on the go and I just want a good rpg game I can sink A TON of hours into and I don’t see many and as afraid not many will come out on it. Then for the ps vr it’s so much fun being in a game and there’s some cool games coming out but I’m afraid that not many will come out for that either and they have a short story and stuff.

gaming,[removed]
gaming,"So, with today's news that yet another game will be a timed Epic exclusive, maybe it's time we stop blaming the developers and start blaming Steam. Steam is operating as if they're the only name out there, and they're not.

Right now Steam takes a 30% cut of everything sold on its store. No ifs and or buts about it. So, if you're a developer, on top of everything else you have to budget for into making a game. You have to know that you're losing a huge percentage of every sale for bandwidth and visibility on a storefront.

We live in the age where bandwidth is dirt cheap and studios put millions of dollars into advertising already. So, there is no way in todays world that people are learning about AAA titles for the first time through Steam. Developers are being taxed just to be in a ""club"", one that more people are fine with not being in.

So, these devs are going to greener pastures, literally, they're keeping more of their hard earned money. Instead of that 30% cut that Steam is taking, I've heard (no source, probably wild speculation) that Epic is taking 12%, on top of that, cutting developers at fat check to lock into an exclusivity agreement. Otherwise, people would still buy it on Steam and the devs still lose out on that extra revenue. On a $60 game, Steam gets $18 and Epic gets $7. It just makes sense to bring home more money.

It's time that Steam starts to rethink their monopolistic practices and stop acting like they're the only name in town. Having a fragmented library isn't the end of the world, but wouldn't it be much nicer to not have to open six different launchers to play six different games?

TL;DR:
Steam is taking a huge cut of sales revenue. Dev's want more of the money to go to them. Epic gives them much better deals. Blame Steam rather than the devs for exclusivity deals that keep more of the money in the devs pockets."
gaming,"I don't fully get it, yes I understand, when a title says its gonna be on one platform and then months before its release they suddenly say ""oh hey we are not gonna be on your platform of choicer anymore see ya!"" especially when they were already accepting pre-orders its just bad practice...aside from that what is the massive deal? Isn't epic store free to download and use....i mean com'on, you have console exclusives and those are not getting as big of an attack as epic store gets, at least you don't need to go out and buy a 200-400 console just to play an epic store game unlike a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 or Spider-man, or Smash Bros. and if you are wanting the game for multiplayer well now not only do you have to buy the console and then buy the game now have to buy a online subscription just to play online. Now for the record I have Epic games Launcher, I do prefer steam and hardly ever use epic launcher at all aside from the free games the offer twice a month with no stings attached as of yet *knocks on wood*....but to me i just want to play the freaking game and enjoy it."

If the big argument is for developers to get more money because of the lower cut taken by Epic. And you have *publishers* (not developers) making deals with Epic for exclusives (2k with borderlands and outerworlds). Adding in the recent troubles with the Infinity Ward CEO and the money management issues brought out in the wake of that (CEOs taking making MICH more than the employees, devs getting rushed, etc.).Are the savings/earning really going to make it the developers? The company over all is going to make more money sure, but are the actual developers going to see any of that? 

To be fair there are no reports of that happening at 2K/Gear Box but it seems to be a wide spread issue in the gaming dev world right now.

My opinion: no way in hell. The executives are going to get a nice bonus because they made a good decision financially to jump to the epic launcher. Time will tell but my money, from a slightly biased perspective, is that devs are going to get nothing more and gamers will be stuck with a launcher, that for now is trash (no sauce but I remember reading about supposed improvements to the epic launcher coming soon)."

I'm like, cool, but I also have at least thirty to forty hours worth of sidequests and collectables still to go so I don't plan on paying for more when I already have a full plate. It seems strange to me to pick up DLC for games when there's still a ton of things to do in the vanilla version.

Ultimately, I rarely buy ANY DLC at all. I usually get my fill playing though the base game. Recently, I was nearing the end of Witcher 3 and so I bought one of the dlc's. Big mistake as I got sidetracked and never ended up finishing Witcher 3 and haven't bothered even booting it up since. Chances are, I won't ever be back even though I had fun.

So, if you do buy DLC when you haven't ""completed"" or ""finished"" a game, why is that? Shouldn't you just save your money for something else while you play through vanilla? "

gaming,"There is a 30% monopoly price agreement among Google play, Apple store, and Steam. 

Game companies in general are already a niche market and they struggle here and there. They don't want to lose 30% of the profit from their game to a seller.

So Borderlands 3 chose to exclusive release to a company that doesn't cost as much to release their game. This creates a competitive market and may make Steam lower their 30% cost.

Game companies make more money, game companies get to make more games, and you should be blaming steam if you really want to blame someone.

If Steam doesn't lower their cost, more and more companies will move to epic launcher because it makes them more money. Everyone will buy from epic launcher if they really want to play the games.

This is a game company saying screw you to steam for their overpriced setup. "

In honesty, Epic Games is giving the creators a lager share of the profits than steam would. Epic gives an 88% share of the games profits compared to Steam that gives 70%. Just from looking at that wouldn’t you as a fan want the developers and team to get the money they deserve for the amazing work they put in on a game? 

I get that some people will say that Epic store doesn’t have anything unique like trading cards on Steam. Personally, the trading cards can be forgotten if it means that the creators make more money. 

At the end of it all just be happy we are getting a new Borderlands. I have waited 7 years for this game and I will be playin this game on launch day. I cannot explain how excited I am for this game!

gaming,"So since the news came out more or less today that Borderlands 3 will be an Epic first release i had some thoughts about it. First of all i'd like to adress that English is not my first language so sorry for some mistakes here'n there and second i have to say that the Epic Games launcher is not that bad after all, personally i never had issues with it, i never got hacked nor was my credit card used or what not. 

Now we get to why the news today made me re-think my plan on buying Borderlands 3. 
As stated above im fine with Epic Games' launcher what really grinds my gears is how out of place the game will be on there. I mean we got no Achivments, no community hub, no forums etc. Plus im sure 80% of all borderlands 3 Players are in the possetion of the other 3 Games on Steam so why are they not releasing it on there in the first place? Steam is the house of one of if not the biggest online gameing community out there and for a community game like Borderlands 3 it's just perfect. 

I'm still looking foreward to the Game and i know that i will probably buy it anyways.. it just won't be the same feeling as it would be on Steam "
gaming,"I don't know about you guys but gaming the past few years has lost its touch with me. I have been gaming since I was about 3 years old playing and falling in love with every game I got my hands on, even the ones that were hated because to be truly honest, I really do love gaming. But lately I have found myself sitting more and more looking at the games in my steam library mindlessly and switching on then switching back off 5 minutes later my consoles. Maybe I should get a switch and try more Nintendo games as I haven't played many since years back with the 3DS. Any suggestions? Maybe hidden gems or popular games I've never given a go? I'm open to all suggestions no matter the price. I have also thought about the fact I don't really have a gaming crew anymore, I used to play the likes of Arma, Space Engineers and all sorts of weird and wonderful games with the same group of friends but we've seemed to have drifted away so maybe some people want to group up? Play a couple games of something? That would be cool. Thanks"

What is a good FPS similar BO2 or BO3 that has a lot of players? For reference, the last games I played were Halo 2 (or maybe 3) and BO2 of Xbox 360. So I don't really know what's new or what's good. 

I prefer just normal deathmatches and basic games, nothing with too much strategy. I also prefer realistic games with semi-realistic weapons (like BO2). Lastly, it would be ideal if the title is also available on Xbox One so I can use a controller I'm familiar with. 

Any suggestions?"

gaming,"I'm a bit of an old git (38M), and I've recently got back into gaming by purchasing a Rift and a RTX2080i (and all the crap necessary for my Alienware 17R3).  Not mega-serious about it before there's a PC vs Console war or people start hating on me for my setup.

Anyway, I bought what I thought were the latest games.  Battlefield V, Apex, Anthem etc, and because I only jump into each about once a week or sometimes less often because of - you know - having to make money to pay for this stuff, I am constantly amazed/appalled by the fact that every time I try and launch a game I have to wait a stupid amount of time for the latest ""update"".

I know from my nephew who used to play Destiny a lot that the most infuriating thing was that he would have to download the latest DLC (or as I used to call them ""expansion packs"") but I thought he was just moaning because he had a crappy Internet connection and was being unreasonable, but I completely get where he's coming from.

So as a result, I can't just think ""I'll just have a few hours on \[insert game here\] tonight"", I have to remote into my laptop from work at about lunchtime and start the download for whatever I want to play.  I have a decent (for the UK) Internet connection so I'm not waiting hours, but unless I've got a leased line straight into EA or Steam or whoever, it still takes a while to come down.

WHAT ARE THEY UPDATING?!?! I was playing it just the other day?  Unless the Nazis in Battlefield suddenly had a discussion with their superiors and changed their uniform via some time-travel device I don't know about, I have to download a shitload of new textures, I don't get why I'm stopped from playing the game.

Doom II never asked me to wait 20 minutes to play it, and that was on a 486DX4-100!

By giving devs more of their game's sales, Epic is promoting better development and making it easier for smaller indie studios to compete.

gaming,"Competition is important, especially in the gaming market. Steam has had 99% of the market share in regards to digital game distribution for the past 15+ years. No one has really came as a competitor to them. Now that we have EpicGames making the EGS (Epic Game Store), we are finally starting to see some. The only issue to this is that the platform is far from ready in regards to a feature, stability and usability standpoint. Let me dive a little deeper and explain.

&amp;#x200B;

When you compare what Steam and the EGS have in common, its not that much. They both distribute games, have a friends list, will give refunds, and... ummm... well crap. This is the main issue people are having with the EGS. Its lack of features. Now personally, I believe that EpicGames can make a really great alternative to Steam in the future, but as of right now with all the missing features, its just not something I feel is ready. Its like early access titles, but for an entire distribution platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to put some salt in the wound as well, EpicGames as time of writing would rather spend their money on having publishers release on the EGS first, rather then hiring developers to work on the platform its self to add these essential features that all game distribution/community platforms should have. It honestly feels like an insult to any community when developers try to force its users to work with something that isn't ready. If EpicGames released the EGS with far more features and was more stable, this kind of backlash that they are getting right now, would be far less.

&amp;#x200B;

As PC gamers, we have had steam forever. We have an expectation as to what other platforms should have. When those expectations aren't met and something like this happens, reactions go south and chaos rises. I fear for EpicGames that with all this controversy, that by the time essential features do start rolling out for the EGS, it will be to late and people will ignore the platform as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

These past few games that have been or are releasing on the EGS have been planned months in advance. These publishers/studios most likely had no idea how far behind the EGS was compared to steam. They were offered a paycheck and the promise of better revenue splitting on the hopes that Epic would be able to make a great platform on release. I ask that future game developers/publishers see that game exclusivity is far from a good idea and future game releases should come to all platforms (on release) and not just a select few. We all have our preferences as to what we want to use. Whether that's teamspeak or discord, amazon or ebay, etc. We like to have our options open and that's how it should be across the board. Including for video games.

&amp;#x200B;

Personal Piece;

I wrote this after seeing all the controversy around the Borderlands 3 announcement that it will be a 6-month exclusive on the EGS. I was from from happy to see this and was hoping it would be available on all platforms on release. I have friends that like the EGS, but personally I feel its lacking features so I don't use it. I have no issue with EpicGames and I appreciate that they are trying to make competition in the game distribution space. Their recent decisions however in regards as to how to gain new users has really left a sour taste in my mouth and I know i'm not the only one with that feeling. My only hope is that Epic will realize that their platform is not ready and revoke the exclusivity deal with these game publishers/studios. Allow the gaming community to decide which platform we want to use for our games. If EpicGames makes a good platform that benefits everyone, naturally people will switch. Trying to force us to use a platform that isnt ready, is an insult and makes EpicGames look worse every time they do something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know what other issues people have with the EGS. I am well aware of the security breaches, the issue with them reading steam data without permission and so forth, however if I am missing something, please let me know in the comments. I want to have a discussion with the community, epic games and steam about why the gaming community is having this controversy.

But it's starting to just look pathetic, to me. I mean.. people review bombed Darksiders, because of Metro: Exodus ending up on EPIC first.

---

Despite how you feel, and despite what you may think.. review bombing clearly FANTASTIC games, is not the way you get your message across. 

People have preached forever ""vote with your wallets"" and ""don't pre-order"". But there was no tangible way for these people to prove their movement among the masses. 

Now that people seemingly have some way they can get their voices heard, by review bombing.. it's just showing an echo chamber filled with incivility. People buying games, bombing the review. Just to review bomb them?

---

I get the point. I understand the motion. I am not against the Steam vs EPIC ordeal. 

But these reviews exist for consumers to decide whether or not the title may be worth a buy. Maybe as a gift for their kid, family member, friends. Maybe just parents trying to see if a game is suitable for their kids or not, before buying it for them.

Just my thoughts, anyways. Please don't turn this into an uncivil match of throwing insults around. There is no point. I'm simply just saying if people want to revolt, then there needs to be a plan.

Basically I'm wondering if it's possible to avoid G2A Plus at checkout. I can see that you can turn the 7-day trial offer 'Off' but I've seen some people saying that they were still charged the 2 euro after 7 days regardless. I REALLY don't want to have to make an account in order to disable it because then I'll probably have to deal with the bullshit inactivity fee or whatever. 

I know I should probably just avoid using the site all together because of how shady it is, but I want a game that was just on sale on steam but is no longer so the prices are still really low on G2A for it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR does setting the G2A Plus 7 day trial button to 'off' during check out actually prevent you from being charged for it."

There's a lot of talk in the gaming community about things gamers shouldn't do, in order to stop incentivising companies to do bad things. Now let's be honest, THIS HAS NEVER WORKED. Companies have, if anything, monetized games as a media platform more than ever in the past few years. Why should we let them? 

I say that people who love games should get out and actually call your government representative and get the ball rolling on having these manipulative and anti-consumer practises banned outright on a state level.

If we can't do that, do you really think one person not preordering one game one time with really do anything? 

PS: My list is nowhere near complete. If you feel the games industry is doing something shady, feel free to add.

Except just recently. About a month or so ago, I noticed an issue with my controller just... not reading inputs anymore. I first had the issue playing through the first Tomb Raider game, where the camera would suddenly swoop to the right or left after a second or two after moving the camera. 

Now, it has gotten worse, but I'm not sure why? Should I just say screw it and get another controller? "

Getting my super fancy 4K tv with HDR I notice the slim kicks out a pretty image, but it irks me that I could get a nicer image with a pro. But at the same time I'm concerned with Sony announcing a bigger badder system right around the corner. 

TLDR, should I wait it out till the 5 or get a regular pro to replace my stolen pride and joy?

So I have a pair of beats studio wireless headphones which I wanted to use with ps4. As the ps4 does not support Bluetooth headphones natively, I looked and found this dongle which claims to work with all headphones. 

Has anyone bought these or tried these and most importantly can anyone tell me if the mic works for the beats wireless. Thanks!

Conan Exiles is listed as 38 GB on the store, but it really totals 76GB. 

This wouldn't be much of an issue but plenty of people have data caps. It would be nice to see the real, updated size without having to start the download first. More so if you're purchasing a game, if you plan to drop some money on a game you should have the right to know exactly how much you're going to need to download otherwise you could end up paying even more for the digital version of the game because you exceed your data cap.

&amp;#x200B;

I was playing GTA Online the other night and out of nowhere I got a message saying ""The database is corrupted, please restart the PS4"". Before I even had a moment to process this, the message went off my screen and everything was back to normal, or so I thought. A few minutes later, my entire console just froze, and then shut down. The light didn't blink on the console as it normally does, it just completely shut down. I turned it back on and it started checking the system status, then it said the message that I wrote in the title of this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any measures that I could take before I initialize my system?? And what could have been the cause for this? I do know that when I went to install the 6.51 update file earlier in the week, that the console just kept on flashing the white light, and I had to manually power it off as it was frozen.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PS4,"People might dislike Conan Exiles, but the atmosphere, the aesthetics and the vibes this game has, are 100% Conan, and true to the universe Rober Howard created. So, by playing I remembered how much I wanted a Conan game. I played the one on PS3, and tbh I liked it, minus a few things that annoyed me, but since then we didn't have anything single player.

Conan's universe is one of the most elaborate, well-written and interesting universes I have ever seen in my life, and it feels bad to know that we might not have a Conan game like this. It could be from open world to stage-based, from an RPG to pure action, and it could still be exemplar if they managed the lore, the scenario and the feeling the right way.

I hope I am not the only one who is a sucker for Conan (and Kull as well) here. I wish the newer generations would discover how amazing the whole universe is."

The paddles are 2 inward and the controller feels slightly smaller than a normal dualshock. Plus my custom paint started chipping almost immediately, with the grip of the joysticks already destroyed in 3 months. The under buttons on the C40 are beautiful and don't add any extra effort to use like the scuf does. I've seen some reviews, but I wanted to know what some of you guys thought.

PS4,"I really feel like they're focusing on gimmicks with VR. I do not enjoy waggling my controller around and pretending it's my hand in front of my characters face. I do not enjoy games designed to be third person having an awkward first person mode shoved in. I certainly don't enjoy the low quality game jam style assets these games have.

I just want normal games where the camera fills my entire field of view, and I don't enjoy this feature being packed as an entirely separate game. I don't see why it's so difficult for games like Gravity Rush or Spider-Man to allow the third person camera to be the ""head"" inside of the VR helmet, allowing me to look around while still controlling the game normally. I know there'd have to be some visual compromises since the scene is rendering twice, and I'm completely fine with that.

And now people are speculating that Ape Escape is going to be brought back as a VR game. That would actually infuriate me, even as a PS VR owner, because I know they wouldn't make it like Ape Escape. They'd just make yet another VR demo to add onto the pile and go right back to the IP being dead. 

VR has been a thing for years and we're still in the tech demo phase. No one is being tricked into thinking they're really Iron Man flying through the sky. The illusion is not being made by having me spin the controller and pretending it's my arm. Just let us play normal games. VR would be best as another display option, not an independent games platform."

It recently refused to boot, and started getting the error code  **CE**\-**36329**\-**3,** which is a software issue.

I've also tried rebuilding the database but still moves slowly and doesn't open games and apps. I eventually wiped the hard drive and started from scratch. It boots sometimes, and still moves too slow to do anything. Even selecting a user can take a minute to two to get to the home screen with multiple freezes. I still get the error above as well.

After doing everything I can think of on the hard drive, I feel like it may be something else. If anyone has any input, please let me know. My next option is to try a completely new hard drive, but I didn't want to spend the money if there's no hope.

PS4,3dRudder controller annouced for PSVR
PS4,"I'll preface this by saying I know I'm probably beating a dead horse at this point, however, my frustration has led me to post this. I've had my console for just over a year (~16 months). Less than a year after getting it (roughly 10 1/2 or 11 months), the left analog stick on my original DS4 started to act up. Initially, L3 stopped responding unless I really put some force into it. Now I'm not the kind of person to abuse things that I've paid good money for, like throwing controllers around. I figured that maybe it was due to my aggressive play style in FPS games, almost always sprinting and rushing around. Then, after a bit of research, I found that this was a common issue with the DS4 controllers. Two or three weeks after I first noticed issue with L3, I noticed that the left stick started to drift or ghost straight up when I wasn't touching it. Not long after that I noticed that whenever I would hit or hold down L2 to aim down sight in CoD, the drift would really intensify and I'd start walking forward without any physical input on the LS. In November of last year, about 1 month or so after problems started, I replaced the controller with a new one, another Version 2 of the DS4. Fast forward to this past weekend, less than 5 months after buying a new one, the left stick started to drift again. This time, I did not have any issues with L3 or interference when holding L2. Again, I haven't one thrown my controller, though it has falling onto the floor a few times from no more than ~2 feet. I just replaced it yesterday, but I'm understandably worried that I'm going to have to replace it in the future, too. I also plan on sending in the second controller for a warranty claim in hopes that it'll be replaced or repaired. I guess the reason I'm posting this, other than to vent, is to voice how ridiculous it is that a console/controller almost 6 years into its life cycle has such a widespread problem. I've had three or four friends in the same situation that I'm in. I really do love the console, but this kind of issue would make me less likely to recommend the console to someone. For reference, I bought my XBOX 360 Slim in 2011 and I still have the original controller it came with that still works. Sorry for ranting, but I felt that I couldn't just ignore the issue anymore."

PS4,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I know remote play is a fairly old feature, but I find it super convenient when it works, which is not super often (or at least not super simple). 

&amp;#x200B;

So my brother and I were playing at home and both had to leave for work, so I whipped out my laptop, launched remote play, logged into his account (we were playing on his console) and registered it manually on the same WiFi network. Connected, streamed correctly, left for work. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I got to work and tried it, it kept searching and couldn't find it. It wasn't a registration or network speed error, and I'm pretty sure the NAT type (2) is not the problem either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Registered manually on home wifi, can't find it over the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Was I supposed to register over the internet (by being on a different network, like my hotspot) to make sure that it was registering correctly over the internet? It seems pretty crazy that the best way to make sure you can play away from your PlayStation is to set it up while away from your PlayStation.

I currently have a pc and i was thinking of building a new one for my girlfriend so we can play co-op (we are huge fans of borderlands), but since i cant do that now without chinese government spying on my sh.t so i decided to get a console instead of building a pc. Now i have eliminated xbox variants because i have absolutely no interest in any of the xbox exclusives, and getting one or two consoles JUST to play borderlands 3 would suck, and i wanna play uncharted 4 god of war spider man etc so i decided to go with a ps4 variant. But the question remains, should i get 2x Ps4 + 1x 32"" monitor and just use the one i have now as the second screen so we each get our own screen or 1x ps4 pro and maybe a 43"" or 49"" tv? Both setups cost roughly the same. Can the original ps4 handle borderlands 3 @1080p60fps? Would split screen effect performance? Will graphics be worse on og ps4? Can pro possibly run it at 4k?

So I have used a Sony USB Wireless Adaptor to connect my Dualshock 4 to my PC (Steam Big Picture) with windows 8 for months now without a hitch. Now, randomly I got an error popup saying: 

**""The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and windows does not recognize it.""**

And now I can't get it to work again, I've tried different USB ports as well, but to no avail.  
I've also tried using other USB devices in said ports without any problems, which I assume means that the Sony USB Wireless Adaptor is somehow broken.

2. I have also looked into purchasing a new one, but it is not available to purchase anywhere. Has it been discontinued?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit older, so here's a trailer for anyone who's never heard of Fahrenheit:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H095eoc4K-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H095eoc4K-0)

PS4,"This sounds really weird, but it just happened to me. My avatar is that mysterious Witch avatar (I still have no idea where it's from) and my languages are set to German, English (US), English (UK). That's how my profile normally looks like, right? But like ten minutes ago I noticed my avatar was a default smiling one and my languages were set to only German. I thought restarting the console would fix it, but it didn't and I manually had to put it like it was before. So I am thinking someone used my account. But I didn't notice anything else. No new messages, no weird communities or anything, and my PS4 is still set to primary. So, who would log on to another person's account, just to change the avatar and the languages. Not to mention I would have probably realized it since I was online the entire time. But then it must have been a bug, right? But I never heard of a bug that changes some parts of your profile and nothing else, I googled it too. Sorry if I sound weird, I'm a little tired and English is not my first language. "
PS4,"Hey,

Anyone able to offer some help with an internet issue I have with my PS4 Pro. It's currently on 5Ghz WiFi, strong connection and speeds of around 40mb,however every time I boot up and play an online game, either first or second round will result in me DCing and no network access on my console.

What's odd about it, is that as soon as I Test Connection in settings, it takes a few moments to pass the first few points, then loads fine and I'll have no other issues the rest of the day. It only seems to happen after first booting up and playing a game, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.

It's highly frustrating, currently playing Dead By Daylight, and if i have a great first game, my progress is lost and I've ruined a game. It doesn't seem like a network issue as everything runs fine on other devices and for the rest of the time, it just seems to be the very first online game I play that it happens.

I am at a complete loss as to what could cause something so... Unique. Has anyone experienced anything similar?  For reference, my Pro is always left in Rest Mode, but I don't think this is what's causing the issue as it'll download updates without problems, and Media Apps run perfectly fine. "
PS4,Hey guys so I'm currently trying to complete the quest alduins bane I've been sitting here for a few minutes and alduin still hasnt arrived I've tried uninstalling the reinstalled the game like some people have said to do but that didnt work does anyone know how to get past this bug if you do I would be very grateful to hear of it
PS4,"Hey guys, has anyone ever experienced the speaker on the ds4 not turning off? I have the volume set all the way to 0 on the sound and devices menu, but sound is still coming out of the controller.

I bought a new controller off Amazon (the berry color limited edition) and see that it's a newer model ds4.

Does anyone know of a way to force it off?"
PS4," 

So my PS4 had been booting up slowly but I never really thought of it as a big issue. It recently refused to boot, and started getting the error code **CE**\-**36329**\-**3,** which is a software issue. I ended up doing the initialize ps4 option and on startup, the ps4 still ran incredibly slow, sometimes shutting itself down since it couldn't load. I've also tried rebuilding the database but still moves slowly and doesn't open games and apps. I eventually wiped the hard drive and started from scratch. It boots sometimes, and still moves too slow to do anything. Even selecting a user can take a minute to two to get to the home screen with multiple freezes. I still get the error above as well.

After doing everything I can think of on the hard drive, I feel like it may be something else. If anyone has any input, please let me know. My next option is to try a completely new hard drive, but I didn't want to spend the money if there's no hope.

Thanks!"

Most of the games that both consoles have I already own on Xbox so this would be just PS4 exclusives.  I would not use it for TV or any other of it's uses.

So should I buy a Pro for just those handful of games or would any model work?  If the performance is dramatically better I would opt for the pro...

Also are there any other exclusive games from this generation that I should buy?"

PS4,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that will live in my mind for many years to come which for me seems to be a rare occasion these days, even The Last of Us hasn’t had as big an impact as this game has, I’ve been pacing myself and working through this game the past 6 weekends and it’s truly been something special. I was even a person who found RDR 1 to be overrated but man, there’s something about RDR 2. I’ve NEVER been attatched or loved a character as much as I have Arthur, he’s modest, honest, with good morals all while being funny and a badass. The atmosphere is out of this world espescially when you’re in Saint Denis around night time, this game is a masterclass and achievement in video games. I truly can’t even explain how I feel about this game it’s grabbed my heart the way nothing else has, the storytelling, the deliberate slow true to life animations that make it feel like a movie, the character development, everything about it has made me fall in love. Honestly the biggest 3 moments of my 24 years of gaming go first game I ever played&gt; playing through all of Resident Evil 7 in VR&gt; Red Dead Redemption 2. I could go on and on but I just wanted to share how proud of Rockstar and how truly honoured I am to play this game."

PS4,"I was playing in the menu during a single player sessions and I went into settings &gt; general and made myself an admin. From there, I pressed start for the main menu and I now had an option for an admin mode. From here you can increase your level to the max, spawn weapons, gear, buildings and even enemy bosses. It’s fun because you can mess around with the games mechanics.
But, instead it allows you  to earn trophies for leveling up to 60, earning a weapon and, defeating a few different bosses. You can also use the admin teleportation to get trophies for reaching new locations. And God mode can be turned on so you can earn a trophy for falling. 
This can all be done the moment you load into a new game."
PS4,"So all I ever heard about The Messenger before it came to PS4 was absolute praise for the game,  I can't recall hearing anything bad about it.  I have heard people say it is up there with Deadcells, Celeste and Hollow Knight.  But then it came to PS4 and I see nothing about it at all, no ones talking about it and hardly anyone even owns it.   on PSNP there is about 200 owners between NA and EU.  Yes I know PSNP isn't all the owners but it gives a good idea of how well the game was received.

What I am wondering basically is if there are any issues with the PS4 version that is holding it back?  I was very interested but it came out right when Sekiro came out but now I am finished Sekiro and wouldn't mind jumping in as long as there isn't FPS issues or input lag.

I did this and it is saying ""The Update File Is corrupted (SU-30645-8)"". I then tried to go to the safe mode directory by holding down the power button and I  pressed ""Rebuild Database"" as I heard it worked for someone. It did not work, saying the same error message again. The last thing I did was to go to ""Update System Software"" from the directory  and clicked ""Update from USB Storage Device"". Again, it did not work.

I have two controllers, both are damaged in different ways. On one of them all four face buttons are sticky, I've already replaced the buttons on it in the past but that did not fix the issue.

On the second, something is wrong with the right analogue stick. It seems that whenever I move the right stick to the left it doesn't sense me moving it all the way, so for example in Division 2 the camera will move very slowly as if I was only holding it half way to the left. If I pull the stick upwards the bug does not occur any more, however I can't really play games without pressing R3.

Any suggestions on how I could fix these? Especially the second one, I feel like I just have to clean the first one better while I have it open."

PS4,"I just bought a PS4 Pro. I have connected it via lan cable to my old PS4, trying to do the “transfer data from another PS4“ process.

I’m having a heckuva time trying to follow the instructions I’m finding at URLs like this:

https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/settings/transfer.html

Reading top to bottom, those instructions seem to say that I have to log onto PlayStation Network with both my old and my new machine at the same time, which I’m reading elsewhere is impossible.

Worse than that, I can’t even seem to stay logged in to both PS4 is with the same username. I get a message saying that my username “has signed in to PlayStation network with another PS4,” and it literally signs me out of the machine.

Other times, it seems like I have had both machines logged in at the same time, and I have been able to get far enough through the wizard together a message: “No PS4 found.”

I’ve connected the two machines to each other, using two different LAN cables, and made sure they’re both on the same wireless network (both 2.4 GHz), and they both have the same system software, and anything else I have found as I Googled around for “transfer data from another PS4“ and “no PS4 found.”

I’m not against throwing in the towel.  After all, I have backed up all my saved games to the cloud, and my trophies as well, and I can download them all back down, and reinstall my games one at a time. 

But I hate to just concede that my brand new machine can’t do the very first thing I ask it to.

 And I’m especially baffled by the fact that I can’t understand the most fundamental concepts of whether to Dave’s can be logged onto PS4 is at the same time, as well as being logged onto PSN at the same time, as well as whether that’s what the short instructions at manuals.playstation.net are telling me what I need to do.

If anyone has faced the same problem and figured out a solution, I would be very open to hearing about it.

I think i have to make my account primary on their system, and their account primary on mine to share games correct?  So...if they log in with their account it would show all of my games.  However - would i be able to copy their save files from my account on my ps4 over to the new system so they didnt lose progress on like Lego Marvel Avengers, or Lego Jurassic World, or Monster Hunter world?  kinda confused how this all works.

PS4,"i tried googling this, and you get answers that yes you can move game to external drive, but no answer if reversing it is possible."
PS4,So I am about to press the button and buying PlayStation plus but I had a quick question. You know these monthly games that you get. I was wondering if I could still access them even after my membership finished or is it ps4 + exclusive?
PS4,"I can connect to PSN and the internet. The internet browser works fine. When I test my connection everything says its working. But whenever I try to join a party, or play an online game, it simply doesn't work. Error code (NW-31194-8) I can still send messages, im connected to PSN. I tried forwarding ports with a static PS4 IP, nothing, no difference. PUnP/DMZ arent supported by my modems interface so I cant try those. Tried different ethernet cords and plugs on the modem, no dice.

Ive tried changing the security of my internet, from WPA2 to WPA, WEP-128, WEP-64, and OPEN. With minor success. On these other security types, when connected over wifi, my PS4 works, technically, but it has horribly variable connection speed, ranging from 5-30 download. Basically unplayable. On LAN with ANY security settings, it doesnt work at all (how does that make sense?). Also on LAN, i get variable speed from 500 download (what my internet should be) all the way down to 60. Ive tried various MTU settings, to no avail.

The internet works perfectly on every device but my PS4. Ive called my internet provider, Mediacom, and all they could tell me was that since every other device works perfectly it must be something on sonys end. Tried calling them and the poor guy couldnt make any sense of why i couldnt play online. 

My modem is, I think, an XTREAM technicolor.

PS4,"Recently gave in and switched from Xbox to PS4, so far here’s what I’ve got in the library; 

Sekiro
The Division 2
God of War
RDR2
ESO
Horizon Zero Dawn (completed, absolutely LOVE IT!)

I enjoy an adventure, but nothing too crammed... I enjoy grinding out quests that aren’t too repetitive &amp; love characters with personalities. I have only played out one game to its end credits, and that was Horizon Zero Dawn that I absolutely fell in love with. 

I’m not picky on the genre by any means, as long as it keeps me intrigued throughout most my time playing! 

Thank you in advance...

I have tried the reset button on the back of the controller too but it did nothing.

Games I have spent a lot of time with as well as score out of 10 of how much I enjoyed the game:

Division 2 (been playing a ton, starting to get burned out) (8.5/10)
AC Odyssey/Origins (enjoyed Odyssey more) (9/10/ 7.5/10)
Warframe (8.75/10)
MHW (9/10)
Destiny 2 (9/10)
Uncharted series (7.5/10)
God of War (9.9/10) (no game is perfect, this is the closest I've found)
RD2 (8/10) (absolutely incredible game and world but the gameplay/ gunplay is so wonky to me that it hurts it's ranking)

I'm sure I forgot plenty but basically a lot of the standard AAA games now that I write the list out. Just been getting bored with many games lately. I definitely prefer PVE over PVP but I'm cool w single player games as well. 

I know this is super vague so will be happy to answer any questions or what not

I've clicked no because everything about that sentence sounds bad, but when I click no, the whole process just restarts,try's to load, says plug in controller, plug in USB, and finally the delete all data sentence, will this actually delete all data?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you're all doing well this weekend! I'm having some trouble with my sister's Persona 5 save file, and was hoping someone might be able to help. Apologies if this is the wrong sub.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister's put about 130 hours into Persona 5, and recently some personal stuff happened in her life that wound up with her PS4 profile being removed from the PS4 her save data was on. LUCKILY, she had the foresight to put her save data onto a USB key. I've got that, and loaded it into my PS4 and signed in with her account and imported the data... It says there's about 10.3 Mb of save data present - but on loading Persona 5, there are no available save slots to load from.

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone technically advanced enough to check what's wrong with her file, and maybe even give some advice on fixing it? Here's a link-- [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r6n1gv2a2p1kvfg/AACpbkXZ9jR5sOCfx7qc7HF6a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r6n1gv2a2p1kvfg/AACpbkXZ9jR5sOCfx7qc7HF6a?dl=0)

Then I went to the store page to download. When I opened Sekiro page, I was taken back to the PS4 main screen. Tried downloading from phone, it says ""waiting for other downloads to finish"", and I was downloading nothing. Tried with other games: library, PS store and mobile download worked. Then I asked for my roommate to try to enter Sekiro PS store page on my non-primary, and it crashed the same way.

PS4,"I downloaded Conan Exiles when it was a PS+ title on Tuesday. I hop on a PvE server to just enjoy some peaceful co-op type experience. I've spent the last 4 nights building out a (what seemed to me as a newbie) a decent starting base. Spent a hefty amount of time farming to make a two story 4x6 home. Furnace, black Smith bench, armour bench, tanning station, bed, and a few odds and ends. 

There's no sources of iron closer to the starting oasis, so I decided to make the journey further up north. I end up making another two story 4x6 similar to the other so I can freely harvest iron and some hides. The area I was in had a cliff well above with more iron, but has spiders to contend with to get to it. So I decide to spend a few hours harvesting resources to build a tower of stairs up to the cliff to making harvesting quick, easy, and spider free. 

After spending the better part of 6 hours of harvesting iron bars and hides, I decide to head back down to my first base to process things and make some weapons/armour. I ran into another player close to my first base who had sense built a pretty hefty base/fort for himself nearby. After a few minutes I get a clan invite and think ""well they obviously know what they are doing if they built this large base in the few hours I've been gone"". I accept and go into my base. 

As soon as I walk toward my chest to start to unload my inventory, I'm immediately kicked from the clan and locked inside my own base...oh wait, I'm sorry, his base. That's right, when you join a clan everything you own that isn't on you is the clans. Both of my bases I've spent days on, all my farmed items in the chest, everything. To top it off I'm locked inside the dwelling with an inventory full of iron bars and hides. The only choice I have is to wait until I die of hunger/thirst....and now I'm respawned at the starting area and my dead body is in the house which can't have my items on my dead body recovered. This is absolutely ridiculous a current game has a blatant griefing system with no recourse.

TLDR: Don't join a clan, you will lose everything you own that isn't on your person. "

Talked to my manager friend and she told me all the gamestops she knew only got 2 copies each and no one is getting shipments in. In fact the preorder has reactived on the site but not for the store

Seriously whats up with that. A weird sales tactic?"
PS4,Oh cool!

PS4,How do i fix this it happens evrytime
PS4,"Yesterday I bought a used copy and I couldn't even install it. So I went back to GameStop and traded it out for a different used copy. The first copy had cracks in the very center of the disc around the hole. Very small. Now the second copy also has the same, just a few more plus scratches on the disc But the second copy I was able to install the game and started up. I had no problem playing the new sequel but every time I start borderlands 2 it crashes and says my game is corrupted. So I put my PS4 in safe mode and rebuilt the database. A lot of people online said this helps with corrupted games but I tried to reinstall it and now It said the disc is dirty and I was not able to eject the disc for my PS4. I restarted my PS4 and I got it out, looked at my disc and nothing wrong with it but the scratches and tiny crack around the center hole. The GameStop employee said that the cracks have nothing to do with the game being able to run. Every other game that I play on my PS4 works no problem at all. Maybe it's just my PS4 telling me that I need to put another 100 hours on Red Dead. 

Any ideas. It's a PS4 pro. One year old.

 However, I suck at this. What would be the best way to do this, as I'm sucking at it with both the d-pad and control stick. Or would there be a button combination if I remap the buttons? I've googled this atleast 20 different ways and I still can't figure it out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

PS4,"I just want to vent about an otherwise terrific game. 

A few hours into starting the game, I experienced the random encounter in which this guy challenges ""a true American gunslinger"" into a little contest of shooting glass bottles from far away. I took him up on his $5 bet, trying my best to keep up with his shooting (again, just started the game). I won the contest and held L2 hoping to trigger some farewell dialogue thanking him for his sportsmanship and Arthur decides to **fucking point his pistol at him.** 

My challenger (who I hoped to part with on good terms) understandably matched my mistaken sign of aggression by whipping his revolver around his hip and shooting a few bullets into me. I hoped that I could somehow neutralize the situation, explaining that Arthur's higher-dimensional puppeteer pressed the wrong button at the wrong moment, but alas, I could not do so and had to gun the aspiring gunslinger down.

*What the fuck, Rockstar.* Why the hell would you map friendly actions and aggressive actions **on the same button.** I hope I can adjust the controls to keep those actions separate (or that Rockstar rolls out an update to change their egregious control scheme) because I can't keep playing this game if it means shooting down friendly passerbys without having any intention to harm them.

PS4,"This is probably a really dumb question, but it would be greatly appreciated if someone has an answer. 

I have already beaten final fantasy 15 and episodes gladio, prompto, and ignis a while ago. Recently, my goal was to start a completely new game of final fantasy 15 because I just purchased the royal pack and I wanted to change the title screen back to the original for this playthrough. So, I deleted my save files for ffxv, but not for the dlc episodes (I backed up everything on the cloud just in case). When starting the new game, I still had all my dlc content, except for the rewards I had gotten through the dlc episodes. 

So, my question is do I just have to delete the save files for the dlc episodes and complete them again to get the episode rewards in my new game playthrough (which is perfectly fine with me), or do I have to completely uninstall and reinstall the game and dlc episodes, and then beat the dlc again? I just want to know before dedicating time to recompleting the dlc episodes, only to find out that I missed out on the in-game rewards because I missed a crucial step.

Thanks again for any answers. "

Plug everything back and working again.

**PS4 error Ce 33986-9 error code** is an error if you may not reach the PSN server. It can be the Playstation server is undergoing maintenance, if it will wait till the server is up however if your internet connection has a problem. There are lots to check for. Please see below for the guides.

Firstly, please usually shut down your **PS4 and unplug it.**

Then, shut down and unplug your router and modem for a minimum of thirty to one min.

After this, power on all device and check out to see if you’ll connect.

If you may not connect take a look at your internet speed by accessing [***speedtest.net***](https://www.speedtest.net/) using your laptop or your mobile phone.

If the output of the speed test net is equal or nearly equal to your subscription, your PS4 association has the problem. Otherwise, your ISP is that the cause, if it’s the ISP call them or attempt another day.

* Try to connect through another network setup, if you’re using coax cable attempt using local area network or the other way around.
* If both are having the error, connect on to the modem, then reset your modem to revive its default setting and take a look at once more.
* However, if one in all the setups is running smoothly, please see below.
* For local area network problem, hunt for a spot with a much better local area network signal.
* For ethernet cable problem, replace the cable. You may also attempt using an alternative router or modem ports.

**NP-31950-8 error code** have you got the **NP-31950-8 problem** “oh shit” even I was facing this problem now..! so, I thought I would like to share with you how I solved the problem ..!

fixps4error will tell all exact problem..! do visit our site when you get any problem on your [***ps4 error’s***](https://fixps4error.com/). I wish you will understand all the issues of the ps4..! if you want to say anything do comment down..1 I will answer your question..!

## Here we go to solve NP-31950-8 error code

* You get this problem even because of network connection time out during the PSN.
* Internet connection test by going to \[Settings\] &gt; \[Network\] &gt; \[Test Internet Connection\] to confirm you can connect to the network.

And even if you are not able to connect, try by using resetting your local network connection, by powering off your ps4 and wait for 5 minutes and turn it on.

If even that helped you then update your ps4 firmware. And do contact your router manufacturer and internet service provider if you are required…! or do try later because the server may be having high traffic.

I was on a wired connection, but I got the ***NP-31950-8 error code*** after 5 – 25 minutes being online in-game. Even the PS4 Party connection would drop, so it was not related to the game itself.

In the end, I discovered that my new wired cable CAT5E should be supporting 1000MBIT, but it was only supporting 100MBIT. This was because it was wired wrong.

I changed the [*internet cable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_Internet_access), saw that I am now on 1000MBIT and I have no more connection issues. then I checked the 1000MBIT support via the switch port lights AND via the router “connected devices.

The **CE-34788-0 error code** on PS4 is a fairly common problem for owners of this console from Sony, what this error is and how to get rid of it.Immediately you need to say that the question itself is minor and is solved very quietly, so you do not have to spend a considerable amount of time on it.  
📷

Thus, the CE-34788-0 PS4 Error Code on the PS4 occurs when the user tries to update the firmware version using USB storage, on which the new **firmware is downloaded**, downloaded from the official Sony website.

The problem is the[ *firmware version*](http://www.icom.co.jp/world/support/download/firm/) you are trying to use to upgrade your PS4.

The cause of the CE-34788-0 PS4 Error Code on PS4 is, and you will surely be surprised by it. You downloaded the wrong version of the firmware needed for the upgrade to USB storage.

## Error CE-34788-0 on PS4

Go back to the [***official Sony website,***](https://www.playstation.com/en-in/get-help/ps4-system-software/) in the PS4 system software download section, and carefully,

📷

Remember which link you used when downloading the **PS4UPDATE.PUP** file (firmware).The thing is that there are two specific firmware versions for each [***PS4 update case***](https://fixps4error.com/how-to-ps4-update-download/).

Only One version is used to update the PS4 with old firmware version installed on it.

The second version is used by those users who have introduced a new hard disk in PS4,and they need to install the PS4 system software fully.

***CE-34788-0 PS4 Error Code*** on PS4 could appear if you downloaded the wrong firmware version for yourself.

You are a user who wants to update his console on the original HDD,use the big blue button at the very top of the page.

If you’re going to install a new version of the firmware on the PS4 console with a replaced hard disk – use the firmware from

the new system software installation section located at the very bottom of the page this firmware will be approximately 900 megabytes

PS4,"I love the DS4! I think it leaves the competition in the dust... But can it be better? Of course it can! I'd love to see some brave new features in the next generation... 

All I can come up with:

* Dedicated battery level display (I find the existing one confusing, as I'm never sure if it's battery or something else until I'm actually told onscreen)
* An actual display... like a tiny one right where the touchpad is... ? Then again, maybe not...?? Could be some interesting use cases, and screens are very cheap these days...
* Force feedback triggers (R1, R2).. I think this could be really great for shooters and racers. Imagine a shooter where the gun jams, or you're not allowed the fire, so the trigger is locked solid. Different guns could have a different trigger feel. Or a racing game where the brakes fail, or pulse when you slam them.
* Some type of scroll wheel.. for navigation perhaps, but also a sort of 'volume' knob of sorts for different in game controls. throttle, cruise control, etc.

PS4,"Has anyone else had this problem? My Ps4 Pro has randomly started doing this. When I boot it up and get to the home screen the console isn't connected to the internet. It will connect itself after 5 minutes or so, or I have to manually go in to the network settings and connect there. When I reconnect the console doesn't ask for the Wi-Fi password so it still recognises my Wi-Fi as linked.

I did a few google searches and some people recommended rebuilding the ps4 database in safe mode, which I've done. That only solved the solution for about a day though, then it reverted back to doing it.

So my main question is should I try to fix them or just buy new ones"

My TV is saying no signal when plugged into the TV in my lounge. This is despite is working perfectly upstairs on a monitor and it is definitely on the right source etc?

It is a nifty feature though, sorta reminiscent of the Wiimotes in fact."

PS4,"Hello everyone,

I'll try and keep this short, but I am having an issue with my PS4 and I'm not really sure what else to do. If you have any ideas or tips, that would be greatly appreciated.


Background on my PS4: I picked up a 1TB PS4 during Black Friday 2017 (1.5 years ago). I am not an avid gamer, but I will put a few hours a week into playing (mostly Rocket League) while also playing a couple other games here and there (GoW, Battlefield, etc.)


The Problem: Right when Apex came out, my buddy told me to download it. I wasn't a fan of Fortnite, but found this game to be really enjoyable. I was only able to play it for the first couple of days, before the game constantly started crashing on me. Sometimes it would bring up a blue screen with a general error code (CE-34878-0) but other times it would just completely shut off my PS4.


I wasn't too worried, because by most accounts a lot of people were having issues with the game due to its popularity. Though over the next few weeks, most people were able to play the game fairly smoothly, while I can't even get to the main menu of the game (let alone inside a game) without it crashing on me. 


Now, while I enjoyed this game, I wasn't completely heart broken 
since I probably wouldn't play the game all that often anyway. The problem is that more and more of my games are beginning to do this. My roommate tried playing For Honor when it was free on PSPlus, but half the time he would get the error (though he could play it at times unlike Apex which never works) and now we have been trying to play Conan Exiles, and once again the PS4 is crashing. The only common link I can think of, is that games I have payed money for (Rocket League, Battlefield, TES Online, GoW, etc.) have worked fine, whereas games I get for free (Apex, Conan, For Honor) don't work. But, I'm not sure why that would matter. That is just the only link I can think of. Also, I haven't bought a game since Apex came out. So maybe if I bought a game now it wouldn't actually work. 


Anyway... I have called Sony but haven't gotten a ton of help. We tried deleted the game and reinstalling it, connecting to a LAN cable instead of WiFi, rebuilding the database for the games, factory restarting the PS4, and then just last night, initialized the PS4 where we re-downloaded the system software onto the system. None of this has helped at all. Every time it still says that the game data has been corrupted. Sony seems to think it is the game's fault, EA thinks it is Sony's fault. 


Y'all are my last line of help. Has anyone seen or heard of anything like this happening? Any help would be greatly appreciated! "

The way this ended up happening is that I was cleaning the PS4 because of dust, and I also went to clean the laser in the disk drive. But the thing is, I forgot that there was already a disk in there, as I had not used it in a while. So as I unscrewed to mechanism that held the disk, the disk fell out. I thought nothing of it, I put it away and continued cleaning. I finished, put it back together, and went to watch hulu. A couple of hours later, I want to play a disc game, and I can't put the disk in the drive. And now I don't know what to do. I've tried searching google and YouTube to no avail. Anyone got an answer?"

Unplugged and even switched mics (i have 2) still hasn’t worked.

PS4,"So.....my PS4 just died, I have the CUH-1001A, a few days before its demise the fans were super loud, it sounded like a plane taking off, then yesterday I get home from work and the system is quiet (yes I left it running), I turn on the TV and it says ""No Signal"". The system shows a blinking blue light when booting and a steady white light afterwards, which indicates normal operation, which is why I figure the GPU is dead. Anyway, my friend sells me his PS4 Pro the same day, I hook it up, everything works so now I'm trying to recover an insane amount of saved data which I never uploaded to the cloud from the old PS4. Check this out:

While the new and function PS4 is still running, I try to boot up the broken PS4 (the loud fans are no longer loud, probably dead), all of a sudden I get signed out from the PS Network on the functional PS4...which means the broken system successfully booted AND signed into PS Network, it just cant display video. \*Sigh\*

I thought maybe my HDMI cable was loose so I unplugged it and plugged it back in, that restored the sound but was still at a black screen. I unplugged it again to see if maybe the pins or the end of the cable were broken but they weren’t. I even took the HDMI cable out of my Xbox to see if that would fix it and it didn’t. Then I tried the strategy of holding the power button down for 7 seconds to adjust the resolution and the screen still won’t display it.

There’s almost no way it could’ve been damaged, it’s been sitting on my desk unmoved since January and has worked completely fine up until today.

This is the second PS4 I’ve owned in 2.5 years that’s randomly stopped working for no reason, the first one I had would just crash as soon as I loaded up a game. Is there a way to fix this or is the PS4 just the Ford Pinto of video game consoles?"

PS4,"I remember when I was maybe 11 or 12 years old of playing Vagrant Story with a friend on his PSOne. He couldn't shut up about how it was the greatest RPG ever and Squaresoft was full of genius and whatever. He was full of hyperbole, but as I played the game at his house, I couldn't help but agree that it was amazing. Years later when I got my first job and started my PS2 collection of games, I was certain that there would be a Vagrant Story 2 waiting for me to play. But it never came. Like Parasite Eve the IP died off with the PSOne and I never learned what happened to it. I did see Final Fantasy XII having a ton of references to it, and the PS3 had it in the PSN, I think?, but otherwise nothing.

That it died was strange. It received a 40/40 from Famitsu, sold 100.000 copies within the first 20 days of its release despite going against Chrono Cross and Legend of Mana being launched very close to its release (both sequels to some of the greatest SNES RPGs and beloved IPs at the time) and was basically well loved by everyone I ever talked to. 

So why did it died? Do anyone knows why it didn't go forward as an IP? I looked it up and the same [IGN article](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2000/06/16/squares-summer-lineup-off-to-a-hot-start) that says that it sold 100k copies within 20 days of the release says that a Squaresoft source told IGN that if it sold 500k copies they would go forward with a sequel. Which I find kind of strange because people did sequels to games that sold a lot less than that. But anyways, didn't it hit that mark? How does a game as good as that simply disappear? "

&amp;#x200B;

Devil May Cry 4 came out and I kept getting the ""PS4 is hot"" messages. I couldn't even play Red Dead 2 without hearing the fan on super turbo the whole time. Same thing with any AAA release. Launch day Pro. I cleaned the fan over the top lid plenty of times.

This year recently, my system would just turn off while customizing matches in WWE2k19 and would just die from overheating right when Dead By Daylight starts. It would restart and repair the hard drive and waste ten minutes everytime. That damn fan was on turbo for any game over 10gb. I couldn't just buy dlc for a game and not play it. It was time to try the thermal paste thing everyone was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on amazon. Spent under 20 bucks to get thermal paste, rubbing alcohol, and that special screwdriver.

&amp;#x200B;

Took about an hour and a youtube video. Cleaned it and applied some pasted. I played everything the last 2 hours without hearing the fan once. It was a miracle. Seriously. I never heard Red Dead so clearly. It's like i bought a new PS4Plus or something. I haven't felt this great about gaming in a while. Seriously. Not hearing that fan is the best.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're scared to do the thermal paste, just get that screwdriver and take it apart. The heatsink by the fan was CAKED UP with major dust in that corner. I feel just cleaning that helped a lot. So go for it. It's worth it.

I haven't been able to reproduce it on any other app or from another video source besides the PS4, and cleaning the ports and swapping HDMI cables hasn't changed anything, which makes me think it's almost certainly not a hardware issue.

PS4,"My brother has been interested in getting a second PS4 for his daughter and was trying to look into game sharing between systems and searched online with mixed results on information. There are just a few point he wanted cleared up.

1. How exactly does it work? We found multiple explanations but most of them make it sound overly complicated. I was under the impression if your account wasn’t activate as the primary PS4 then the games wouldn’t work. But searching online makes it sound otherwise. Just, again, most directions are overly complicated. 

2. Would it work where the same game could be played? So if my brother purchased say Battlefront 2 digitally and found a way to out it on his daughters PS4. Could they then both play the same game at the same time?

3. Would my brothers PlayStation plus work with her account as well? He’d like to avoid having to buy multiple plus memberships if possible.

4. Is this ok to do? When searching some said it was fine and other said you could get banned. So I’m hoping to get some clarification on that part.

Both ps4’s would be in the same household running off the same internet. I just was checking here for him to see if someone here could give us some clear uncomplicated information if possible. Thank you for any help you can provide."

PS4,"Man I'm absolutely loving playing really good single player games again. 

I've spent the last 5 years playing competitive PC games such as LoL, Overwatch, csgo, etc. I love those games, and they can be very rewarding (and frustrating) and definitely give a dopamine rush, but I have really missed playing good single player games. 

I just bought a PS4 and am looking forward to playing all the excellent PS4 exclusives this gen. I had a ps2 as a kid and loved that console, but this PS4 gaming experience is great so far. It's a nice change of pace from the PC games that I was playing. I love competition, but at the end of the day those games are a very repetitive experience. 

I feel like I'm experiencing so much more by going through this single player games."
PS4,"Just wanted to see if anyone knew that if I backed up my games from a pro and then tried to restore them onto a normal ps4 if that would work.

PS4,"So Gamestop has a pretty sweet deal for a $200 trade-in credit on your PS4 Original or Slim.  I am thinking this is an opportune time to finally upgrade to a PS4 Pro (and yes, I do have a Samsung UHD 4K TV).  Honestly, I am not a graphics hoe and more curious about performance on the Pro than the eye candy upgrade.  Currently, my PS4 Slim's dashboard is sluggish and the loading times are also questionable.  Does the PS4 Pro noticeably boost up performance (or is it merely a 4k resolution console)?    


And I know this has been asked ad nauseum, but are the enhanced 4k boost in graphics worth the upgrade?  Like, would I notice a significant difference playing Black Ops 4, Horizon Zero Dawn or Gran Turismo Sport?"

PS4,"I bought a new controller but it's different from my older one. Both are V2. The new one's analogs are a bit sticky. My old DS2 and DS3 got sticky, too but it was after using them for years... The real difference is though the buttons. All my DualShocks over the past 20 years had glossy buttons so did my previous DS4V2 and this new one has matte buttons. It's still not the biggest difference. The new one has smaller buttons. ALL OF THEM are smaller. Here is a picture (black is the new):
https://m.imgur.com/a/RGt7qp4
You can see that it has way bigger gaps between the housing and the buttons. This causes different feel to pushing them. If I push them on the side they don't have that 'clicky' feeling. Aaaaaand. That's all... probably.
So I wonder if this is a fake one or Sony just lowered their standards near the end of the generation.
The best way to check would be if someone could show me a controller from a newly bought PS4. Maybe from the RDR2 Bundle cause that probably has the newest controllers packed in.
Thanks"
PS4,"I bought the game a long time ago and played it every now and then, always enjoying it. But I recently decided to actually finish the game, and I can’t believe more people don’t know about it or just didn’t think it was worth buying. But let me tell you. The game is a 2D platformer, where you collect all sorts of weapons, spells, traps, etc. and slowly kill all of the Greek Gods. It’s like an indie God Of War, but with an almost Dark Souls type of gameplay (The combat is simple but there are tons of weapons to pick from and tons of armor as well. But It’s similar to DS in that your constantly changing up your playstyle to best suit the given situation. Plus there’s tons of secrets to find.) Greek mythology is made up of some pretty brutal and dark stories, and this game shows the darker side to the mythology we all know. Check out a trailer and see if you’d like it! It was also free on PS Plus a while ago so maybe you already own it! "

📷

**Step 3**– Select the “Update System Software” option from the next menu. After doing so, the system will automatically follow the latest firmware for your console. If the newest version of the firmware is not installed on your console, the PS4 software update will automatically be downloaded to your system..

📷

**Step 4**\-Install the latest firmware: After downloading the newest version of the firmware, the notification will be displayed in the upper left corner and above.

PS4,"Back story: we were playing Mc, I fucked up and lost all the loot on a journey I was on, auto save saved Right after it happened, my partner went in and deleted that save (while there were still other saved minutes before as well had weeks/months before left)

After reloading the game, he still had all his stuff on him but we were both re-spawned as if we had died with out beds. So we left the game, restarted the ps, came back and our whole world was gone, go into the “load” page and it doesn’t even show up. 
Go back into storage and our saves from weeks and months ago are there with the thumbnail of our build. 

He did try downloading from PSN the save, and we still had the same results.

We think it bugged out and we are screwed but I’m hoping maybe someone knows a solution/ has had this problem before?"

PS4,"I'm talking about those games that you never imagined that they could exist, since few people could be interested in them.

Here's mine: [Baila Latino](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/baila-latino-ps4/). From the description: ""The first complete latino dance game with 20 of the most famous hit  songs in the world will make you feel the hot Carribbean atmosphere or the sunny beaches of Miami directly in your living room! Among Baila Latino's songs we have Guantanamera, La Macarena, Ai Se Eu Te Pego and Mueve La Colita"". Available on physical and digital versions (29.99 USD).

I believe small studios deserve a chance, so kudos to the developers of this game. But still an unusual game."

PS4,"Hi folks, 

I’ve recently bought a brand new PS4 Slim (500gb) with a couple of games (on disc). Each game freezes/crashes with the error code CE-34878-0. The crash always happens within 20 minutes of playing. 

So, I installed an external Seagate 2tb SSD to save the games to, thinking that would solve the problem. It hasn’t. 

I’ve also rebuilt the database, given the machine a full initialisation and reinstalled the games from scratch (to the external drive). However the games still freeze. 

I’m at a loss as to what could be causing this, so any advice would be appreciated. 

I notice that the game data still saves to the internal HDD while the rest of the game is saved to the external drive. I’m wondering if the 500gm internal storage is causing the problem? 

Thanks! "

PS4,"So I have my account on two PS4's 

I have my main own and then I have my account set as primary on a friend's (and his as primary on mine). Things have been working fine since we set this up a week or two ago but then yesterday all my games were locked on my PS4 - despite being online. I tried restoring licences but still no luck.

We swapped them back around and of course now we have access to our own games but the entire reason we were doing this was to share a game (basically neither of us have much money so we split the cost of MK11).

From what I understand, if my account is set as Primary on his PS4 I should still be able to log in on my PS4 and play my games as long as I'm online. Likewise with his account set as primary on my console I should be able to play his games on my profile.

Anyone got any experience with this?"

by the way is not like i have a lot of time to play games during the week, but would play mostly on weekends.
for the online choice, i would probably just play fifa ultimate team. however i can only build my team in a month. could still just buy the 1-month online subscription in july which is when i have a 1 month break. but i am worried about not being able to control the urge to play till then
on the other hand the 3 games would be detroit, persona and edith. the 3 of them are going for 20 dollars, whick i consider to be a steal considering how high rated are these games"

PS4,"Hey Sony, don’t know if you’ll see this but I was wondering why does Call of Duty need PlayStation Plus?

I downloaded Call of Duty Black Ops Four: Blackout recently. I loaded it up and I was ready to play it. Once I “press x to play” and it says I need PlayStation Plus. I was so upset because I play FortNite all the time and it doesn’t need  PlayStation Plus. And I don’t really have the money to buy PlayStation Plus.

So what I’m trying to say is can you put in the option to play Call of Duty or any other games that need PlayStation Plus away. Yes, I know you need to make money but there are plenty of other ways to get money from customers."

PS4,"I’m moving something to my 2tb external hard drive from the 1tb internal, about 30-something gb. It says a normal time (around five minutes) before suddenly shooting up to around the half hour mark. Tried different games, same kind of thing happened. Never seen this before. I know it can take a while, but not this long, and it usually wouldn’t pull a prank on me by saying it was gonna be a lot quicker. Any ideas?"
PS4,"Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo under investigation in the UK over their subscription services"
PS4,"So recently my PS4 broke down after having it for 5 years. 
The reason ? Due to motherboard failure.
The HDD i have on the PS4 is 2 TB HDD with all my saves, DLCs and game content over the 5 years of playing on it.
There is no issue with the HDD.

So, getting to my question.
Will I be able to swap the 2 TB HDD that I have with all my game content on it with a new PS4 without having to REFORMAT the drive ??"
PS4,"For anyone unaware, controller stick drift is when the controller stick basically does what it wants. In my case, whenever I would press the L2 button, my character would move forward in-game, even though the stick wasn't moved forward physically. Another issue was that when I would push the stick downwards fully, the character would barely move, almost stuttering backwards. The problem doesn't have to be exactly how I described to be considered controller drift, but that's the general premise of it.

To start off, I should say that this doesn't work 100% of the time, but it is a good first try nevertheless before you start disassembling your controller, which could break it irreversibly if you don't know what you're doing and you make a mistake.

Now, the fix is very simple. It is caused by the area in the controller, around the stick being dirty. Residue and dust can cause controller drift.
The first thing you do, is push the stick that is having problems in any direction (left, right, up, down), and suck air from the other side. For example, if you push the stick leftwards, put your mouth up close to the right side of the stick, where the sort of slit is that goes to the inside of the controller, and suck air, hard, for about two seconds. This will clear out the residue that may be inside. Do this for all the sides of the stick. After you've done this, do the same thing again, except this time, blow air into it. This will ensure that the residue is clear.

There are a couple reasons this might not work.
One is, the residue can't be removed by blowing air, which could be because it is sticky, and it has stuck to the inside. In this case, you will have to disassemble the controlled, and use rubbing alcohol with cotton buds/q-tips to clean the harder to get out residue. You can easily look up a tutorial on YouTube on how to take apart the controller.
The second reason, is that the stick is damaged. Don't worry, this doesn't mean you have to buy a new controller. You will have to buy a new part, which is quite cheap, and you can replace the damaged part. You can do this all yourself at home.
I can't be too specific on these last two options since I don't have any experience with doing them because the first method worked for me.

You can find lots of tutorial videos on YouTube showing you how to do the last two options by searching up something like ""dualshock 4 stick dirft fix"".

I wanted to make this post just in case some people were having problems with their controllers and were thinking of buying a new one, when there is no need. Not a lot of people are familiar with the first method I described, and even if this helps one or two people, the 10 minutes it took making this posts was worth it, because by god, is stick drift annoying.

PS4,"You see the title! I’ve had this ps4 since 2014. The WiFi adapter doesn’t work, so it’s always hardwired into the net. It runs slow. Games I’ve DL’d crash somewhat “often”. Running out of memory. 

So should I upgrade or wait it out...?"

PS4,"This might sound conspiracy theorist here but beat with me lol. I’ve always used the standard black DualShock 4 controllers and they have lasted me about 2 years before they start to go up (stick drift). This past summer I bought the newer color variation (navy blue) and here I am about 7 months later and the right stick has already gone up with the worst stick drift I’ve had so far. I know there are tutorials for fixing this blowing into the stick, pressing and moving in a circular motion, I have done these and it fixes it for about an hour but then the stick drift comes back and it’s been throwing off my gameplay. I’ve never had a controller go up this fast and it’s making me think that maybe these color variations are cheaply made. Could just be a coincidence but this is the first time I’ve bought one, the standard black DualShock has always lasted longer for me. Was going to hold out until the alpine green released later this month but I think I’m just going to stick with the standard black from now on. What do you guys think? "

PS4,"The analog stick work fine, but sometimes when I move with the left stick, the right stick also triggers itself (even though it's not moving)
It really is annoying, especially at FPS games where my aim goes completely off. I didn't replaced the sticks. Any help is appreciated. "
PS4,"1st question: Okay so I know that many people have stated online that they can smell their ps4 when it runs.  That's not what I'm wondering.  What I'm wondering is why it has a ""CLEAN"" smell.  Does anyone else think it smells good, as like you just opened a window for fresh air?    


2nd question:  Are there any games designed for adult females? I know that any gender can play any game, but I mean like something that's not as hardcore in the violence-- or even not violent at all lol. "

So: Is the Nathan Drake Collection simply a bundle that contain the three remastered games, or is there some difference between the collection and the separate remasters?

It seems like a stand-alone release, not a bundle that comes with all three remasters, but it's not clear to me what the difference is (I'm used to Xbox where bundles work a little differently). Thanks!"
PS4,"I couldn't connect to the net through my PS pro, other devices were working, so I rebooted router through my router settings and then my screen went black for about 5 seconds, maybe more and the error ce-36329-3 appeared. 

Apparently an error has occurred with sysrem software or something. No idea how the router reset triggered this in my ps4 pro. 

Anyone else experienced this, should I be worried or know what caused this? 

Thanks guys. "

PS4,"Hi all,
I've just started HZD and having a ton of fun. I tend to be the type to explore every inch of the map. Some games tend to reward this, by having the occasional item or point of interest right at the edges of the game map, and some dont. I know not everything of interest is necessarily marked on the map, but should I put much effort into climbing around at the very edges of the map? Is there much there?"
PS4,So I will try to describe my issues im having as best as I can. When I log into remote play via my mac it opens and shows my profile logged in but the wallpaper isnt what i have set and lots of games are missing and not downloaded. When I just turn on my ps4 pro its normal. Why is this? Is it possible that due to me having multiple profiles something has gotten jumbled up? I really dont know whats going and any help is much appreciated.

PS4,"I hope this does not break the rules, I wish some input for a really scary experience. 

So today I was playing a game on my PS4 Pro when all off sudden the game started acting as if someone else was controlling it. 

I thought that this was definitely weird as I was literally unable to use the controller, so I started another one, but the same thing continued, and this time whoever was “controlling” my screen clicked off the app, and moved on my homescreen. At this point I panicked and got the game disc out of my system/ turned PS4 pro off. I returned it back couple times, and each time the same thing continued, and I was unable to use controller, and it acted as if someone else was using it. 

Obviously at this point I used different internet to change my psn password and rebuild database on my ps4 after that.

I also googled if anyone else had this kind of issue, but only came up with one post about 3 year in this sub saying their PS4 was hacked and people taking it it as a joke.

What doesn’t help I met this random guy recently in the game I was playing, and talked with him the other day. He seemed nice first but then started being an asshole and being inappropriate (I am female, and I turned him down..) He asked me also what would I do if I lost game progress etc. and said that his account was so fresh because he changed from Xbox due to getting hacked there... now I don’t know for sure but my theory is that he might have been the one behind this, as I don’t have any problem with other people and I have never ever had this happen before. 

What doesn’t help also couple days ago my email had unsuccessful login attempts for different countries.. and I am also unable to change my email account password associated with the psn (but waiting reply on google.)

I also use 2nd verification security with phone number, but is there anything else I should or can do?

Tl;dr: PS4 pro game started acting like it was controlled by someone else. Couple days ago someone asked me questions about hacking and got mad at me. Suspicious activity also on email and I don’t know what to do."

PS4,"3 months ago

So here’s the rundown -
One day, out of the blue my PS4 consul decided to start this crap.
- powers up fine
- gets you to start screen
- REGARDLESS OF WHICH CONTROLLER IS USED:
- all controllers connected flash white, and then go to amber.​
- all controllers are charged, and fully functional with my other PS4​
- can be connected w/wo cable, and problem still exists.​

Controllers are not the issue
Cables are not the issue
The issue seems to be the PS4 console has lost its ability to pair with anything
Every controller used is in perfect condition, and works fully on other devices
Any idea what the issue is?

It’s more of an annoyance than a serious problem but I was curious if anyone else has seen this or found a solution. "

PS4,"Hi everyone. Apologies for just turning up and asking stuff straight away but I'm a tad stressed and don't know what to do. Basically I fell asleep with the PS4 on last night and left it to autoshutdown. Got back today and out of no where it's seemingly begun a death spiral. It's kind of difficult to explain properly so I'll have to break it up into bits and bobs. I have tried EVERY solution i can find on Google, short of full initilisation. My internet is also nearly 100 down and 10 up, with lapses rare - and for this scale of problem non existent.
- MOST icons that require internet to load hang forever. Game icons are fine, as are icons for deleted games in capture gallery and trophies. However everything else hangs forever, leaving the system to endlessly load junk in the background. Includes All TV/Video icons &amp; ads, most (but not not quite all) friend images, EVERY item in the library, anything and everything on or about the playstation store and whats new area, - it all just hangs. Some of loads if i leave it 15 mins, some of it just gives me corrupted images. 
- My online-only library (bought games that aren't downloaded) randomly clearing out to 0 games, then repopulating, emptying and repopulating again.
- Random things taking an age to load (PS+ page, settings of the internet browser etc).
- PS4 crashing with the three beeps upon any attempted restart or shutdown (I realise this is probably an effect of the infinite loasing but worth mentioning).
- Complicated by the fact very specific online elements, such as upcoming events on Black Ops 4, DO load in. Games and apps also work after they've loaded, but judging from this im not sure that'll last.

Sorry for the wall of text. I've done everything I can and am completely stuck with no spare money to magic it better. If anyone can help I truly owe your arse a blood debt. "

PS4,"A technician came to fix my internet problem by installing a “splitter” up on the telephone pole. 

I go into a game of Fortnite (don’t hate me) and immediately freeze. I launch a couple more games and freeze at some point entirely, I don’t lag I just freeze along with everyone around. Since I’m 2 rooms away from the router, I’m thinking the problem is the splitter. So I move my PS4 to the living room and hook it up via Ethernet cable. I attempt to play with the same result, now I’m thinking it’s maybe Fortnite itself and not an internet problem. I re-download Apex Legends and play a game. Everything is going great without lag when all of a sudden I froze, just great. I (attempt) to play a couple more games with the same results. Now I know for sure it’s not an internet or game problem, what is it that’s making all games unplayable?"
PS4,"I am not completely sure what the source of the problem is. When I am play games, the controller will be unresponsive and the character I am controlling will move a random direction and the buttons will be unresponsive. I tried switching to one of my other 3 controllers and I continue to have the same issues. I typically sit about 5 feet away from the system, if I get any further than that, the controller becomes even more unresponsive at times. My controllers will also randomly disconnect while playing games. 

Is this an issue with my controllers or my system? I got my PS4 on the release date. I am leaning towards it being an issue with my system because it will also turn its self on and try to eject the disc that is inserted."

My roomate seems to be able to play Apex fine but haven't tested recently as hes been playing sekiro. My internet seems to be fine as every time I disconnect all my other devices are still online and I can still browse the web. I also called my ISP and they said no issues on their end.

I enjoyed it too. I think a Syphon Filter reboot in this day and age could be huge. A God of War kind of reboot. Just something big and grand. I'm shocked that Sony abandoned Syphon Filter. It was such a cool franchise with a cool name and a cool logo and it was basically their own metal gear. Out of all of Sonys dead IPS, other than Jak and Daxter I think Syphon Filter has a huge amount of potential to do will in the current day.

pokemon,"I am stupidly excited for this movie.... The moment I saw Pikachu come to life that was it for me, I was on board and hyped as hell. One recent TV spot however left me with a strange ""fear"" for the movie. Nothing terrible or something that would ""ruin"" the movie, just something I hope the movie ""avoids"" over use of.

The recent TV spot in question, Pikachu says ""Oh sweet mother of Arceus,"" after the lead actress scratches his chin. A cute scene and the line is funny and a nice indicator the filmmakers are doing their research and showing that they care.

At the same time though, the line also made me think if their would be other lines similar to this. As in, what their other lines that exist simply to remind the audience that ""this is a movie set in the Pokemon world, remember that now!""

Not that this is inherently a bad thing, it helps build up the world and makes it feel like humans and Pokemon truly Live here. I just feel if overdone it could danger too close to ""Pokemon references the movie.""

Odds are I am overthinking this by a huge margin and I'm sure the movie will be all good or at the very least a fun time."

pokemon,"I have recently been going trough the under used Pokémon with Pokémon showdown, and found some really nice pokemon and moves that I felt like sharing. My favorite right now is snatch, cause of how it can steal any move that is made to heal or buff, including aqua ring and the screen moves like reflect and light screen, and let your Pokémon use it. It has been very helpful to keep my foe from setting up with light screen or using roost when I’m about to take down something powerful. Definitely a niche move, but it has some major priority bonus in battle.
Also, a favorite Pokémon from under used is cofagrigus. It is a tanky pokemon with a fun, unique ability that works amazingly well with a ring target(also under used item) to negate pesky abilities that any physical attacker might have. It has pain split, snatch to startle your opponent and moves like infestation to keep them from swapping out easily. It is a big defense wall and really fun to use.

Also, you don't need to, but you can, if you want, to do other characters as well. I know it's a way too early for this, but I still want to know."
pokemon,Rowlet squishy I made. Finished just in time to take this cute picture!

Sounds rad as hell. Like a new Power Rangers series of a Gundam spin off. Swish is the dumbest sounding thing to me and SS is a little confusing with HGSS. And before someone makes a comparison to the other SS. We know. Glad you went to history class."

pokemon,"Im playing through X for the first time and came across Goomy. I had seen videos on it and its evolutions in the past and thought it was pretty cool. I mean, who would want a blind slug boi with super acid? Then I started using Goomy and I have pulled exactly 7,698 hairs out of my head in frustration. 

The thing levels up ridiculously slow. My pokemon have leveled laps around Goomy because it takes a lifetime to level up. It's also the weakest pokemon on my team. Is has fainted more times than the rest of my pokemon combined. It seems like every battle I send it out it gets KO'd immediately. 

I really hope Sliggoo and Goodra are great, cause Goomy is testing my fleeting patience"
pokemon,I am debating playing through ultra sun again because I picked male. The thing is their trainer customization is not very good. I would only use it for trading back and fourth. I am thinking of putting Larantis outfit on one and nurse on the other. I can get the nurse outfit any time because I have a complete pokedex on my bank. I am also thinking of restarting it so I can egg rng on both games without the 127 magickarp.

pokemon,"Hello everyone!

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

The goal of this event is for you guys to get a chance to rebuild a Pokémon once a week! What do we mean by that? Well we will be looking to find Pokémon who just can't seem to find a niche in their tiers or the current competitive scene and finding ways to revitalize them! This means thinking about new moves, stats, or typings that help give the Pokémon in question a new role.

**This week's Pokémon is Durant**

**#632 Durant** (Japanese アイアント Aiant)

*Iron Ant Pokémon*

*Individuals each play different roles in driving Heatmor, their natural predator, away from their colony. They attack in groups, covering themselves in steel armor to protect themselves from Heatmor.*

**Durant's Base Stats:**

* **HP:** 58
* **Attack:** 109
* **Defense:** 112
* **Sp. Attack:** 48
* **Sp. Defense:** 48
* **Speed:** 109

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/durant/)

**Introduction:**

* ~~Kevin~~ Durant isn't a Pokemon you hear or think of often, but it's actually already a decent Pokemon as is. It has a great typing, a good stat distribution for a physical sweeper, a good ability in Hustle, an amazing movepool... what could possibly go wrong? It's hard to directly counter Durant, but normally, having access to a decent and faster Fire-type or special attacker does the trick. A popular Durant set being used is Hone Claws Steelium-Z, which opts for more speed with Jolly nature.
* Durant starts in gen 5 at the RU tier. It was bumped up to RUBL in gen 6 after the introduction of Fairy-types made Steel-type a viable offensive typing. Otherwise, it didn't gain anything new.
* Durant is still in RUBL today. Durant has a great typing, good stats for a physical sweeper, a good ability to boost physical attack, a good setup move in Hone Claws, and a deadly movepool. It also has a very niche and well-known strategy of Entrainment Truant as a means to cripple opponents, but it's very situational. Durant's flaws are its frail defensive stats; while its typing and physical defense are good, they're mitigated by its poor HP and special defense. Furthermore, any decent special attacker who can outspeed or take a hit has a good chance of knocking Durant out in one blow. Finally, any scarfed/faster Fire-type can deal with Durant no problem if it isn't scarfed itself; Durant's speed is decent, but many OU Pokemon can outspeed and take it down.

**What changes (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings) would you give to Durant to give it a fair shot in the OU meta?**

**In addition to ways to make this Pokémon competitively viable again, feel free to discuss your likes and dislikes about this Pokémon, be they from your playthroughs of the main series or side games, your success or failure with this Pokémon competitively, any cool fan artwork (with the source) featuring this Pokémon that you'd like to share, or anything else!**

**We'd also suggest checking out our** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/pokemon) **each Tuesday for live discussion on these topics as well!**

Voting options for next week's Pokémon will be edited in here and we'll run a one day poll tomorrow before announcing the winner on Thursday. This will then give you some extra time to think of how to revamp the winning Pokémon before the next Rebuild Tuesday rolls around. For today though, [**PM me (/u/SnowPhoenix9999)**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=SnowPhoenix9999&amp;subject=Rebuild+Tuesday+Suggestion) if you have any recommendations for a Pokémon that could use a rebuild!

The wide expanse of space.

&gt;We are lucky enough
to share this lifetime we get.

&gt;We can gain more if we give.
By taking, we only lose.

&gt;Let us make this a new age
where we show our gratitude.

&gt;There's a fragile bud of hope,
blooming in each of our hearts.

&gt;Don't you take that away.
Our dreams are meant to be shared.

&gt;Let it grow. Let it live.
Let us see what it will bring.

&gt;When we share in our love,
we make a beautiful world.

&gt;Search it out, and find the way:
the point where we can all meet.

&gt;The point where we're all the same.
There it lies: the future we seek.

&gt;Start from there, and then we'll forge
a world where all can be free.

&gt;Free to dream, and free to smile.
Free to be who we will be.

&gt;Let's make sure we create...

&gt;A world of our hopes and dreams.

&gt;In our brief lives,
we've managed to meet.
Treasure this gift,
this precious time that we have.

pokemon,"I've seen a lot of mentions about weather lately both from Masuda and from TPC itself (like in the region countdown). It would also makes sense in a region like the UK imo. I know that the weather is the weather and it's something everyone talks about all the time but it's nice to speculate about how it would work in Pokemon. It could be that wild Pokemon change based on the weather , just like in SM we had day and night, I think that would work . It's not the best addition in the world but a nice little one to further give immersion to the player"

pokemon,"Hello everyone! 

Sooo as the title clearly states, I screwed up and I'm looking for some advice.

I'll start by saying that I'm 21yo and I recently bought my very fist Pokémon game (I couldn't have it as a kid, so now that I earn my living I finally could start playing. I'm pointing this out because I made such a stupid mistake). I have Pokémon Gold in the original gameboy color version. I found Ho-Oh, the legendary Pokémon, on top of the Tin Tower and I tried to get it. Ufortunately, I understimated the strenght of one of my rock type Pokémons and managed to exhaust the poor Ho-Oh. I saved afterwards as the real idiot I am (in this old versions you cannot open old savings) and now I cannot find it anymore, so my question is: have I completely fucked up? Is there a way to get again further on the game or should I just forget it and move on? I'm so sad this might mean I cannot complete my fist Pokédex, I really hope you guys can help me out and give me some advice on how to get it back. Thank you in advance!"

pokemon,"I was brainstorming with friends, and with the thematic of sword and shield, what if the new gimmick might be the use of movements in a defensive way? 


let me explain myself:

what about you now could use your moves type to use as protection, IE: your pokemon is GRASS and you are goin to be damaged by FIRE, instead of switch pokemon you use a WATER move in defensive action (Priority, now you are water type just to get the attack)

sure, the pokemon only can use types to defend itself by moves that can learn


I think that don't have some real use maybe, but was just an idea, you could bring ideas of how it could be improved to be bett"
pokemon,"[This](https://youtu.be/D9SPozgRNnQ) is the video in question.

The concept in general is 10/10 and I love it. 

There are a few changes I'd personally make, however:

* Growing Apricorns for use as Pokéballs should be an option so that killing other Trainers' Pokémon isn't an absolute necessity. They should take time to grow, however.
* Have True Pacifist and Genocide routes like Undertale. *(Addressing this right now because I fully expect it to be brought up: I know some people hated that game for one reason or another, but this isn't about the game itself, so don't reject the idea outright purely based on that, okay?)* In a Pokémon game where you can actually kill Pokémon, players who have the restraint and patience to go through their entire playthrough and *not* do it deserve a reward, and it only makes sense for the story to change if the player just starts murder-hoboing the region.
* You are only limited to six Pokémon at a time. I don't mean just in your party, I mean in general. There is no PC storage system.
* In the event that you fail your run and you have to start over, it should be implied that your soul lives on in your new character. Encountering the Pokémon you used to own in the wild should sometimes cause them to recognize you (chance of this happening depends on the bond you had with them with your previous character). If another Trainer catches one of your previous Pokémon, there should be a way of getting your Pokémon back from them (winning the battle, then forcing the Trainer to give it to you?).
* If possible, maybe structure the game like Breath of the Wild. In the sense that you can attempt to take the throne at any time, but your chances improve the more Generals you defeat before attempting to take on the King. Or maybe...Breath of the Wild meets Crackdown? 4 Members of the Royal Guard, each with 2 Generals underneath them?


I'll probably think of more later. That said, I really want to know what you guys think. I'd love to see this made as a fangame, even better as an official game."

I want to have more pokemon to battle with, but Im at a point in the story where the enemy pokemon are all lv45+, which makes it near impossible to actually level up the 3 members in the 30s through combat. Switch leveling is also a pain, and doesnt give near as much exp as just normal combat would. 

Any advice on how to fix this frustrating issue?"

The first one can be found in Rustboro City, where you can trade a Ralts for a Seedot in a house next to the Gym. The nickname of this Seedot is, as above, 'Dots'.

When entering a Contest, one of your opponents can also be a trainer using a Seedot. This Seedot is also nicknamed 'Dots', which you can see on the wiki page here https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Contest_opponents_(Generation_III)

My rather specific question here is do you think this is a case of the localising team forgetting they had already nicknamed a Seedot 'Dots' already? Does the Japanese nickname for this tradeable Seedot, differ to the contest opponent Seedot in the original version?

If anyone knows the Japanese nicknames for the tradeable Seedot in Rustboro City, and the contest opponent Seedot's nickname in the Japanese version of the game, I would love to know if they are the same!

If they ARE nicknamed the same in both games... then what does this imply? 

If anyone can help with this Seedot mystery, I would appreciate your help :)"

pokemon,"I keep on hearing about how people hacked or abused glitches to obtain a Cresselia in the early Diamond and Pearl days. 

This is confusing because it is common knowledge that Cresselia can be legitimately obtained after obtaining the national dex and is not confined to an event.

So why did people exploit or hack the game to obtain Cresselia?"

pokemon,"So my dream started like this. I was on a bus with my friends. It was Christmas for some reason, and there was a lot of snow everywhere (wasn't snowing then). We were on a safari, trying to catch a good look at some exotic animals. We spot a couple of monkeys, a deer, and a couple of other animals I don't remember right now. We're moving along slowly, admiring the cute animals and taking pictures of them, and I swore some of the monkeys waved at us. I don't remember what got me here, but the next thing I know is I'm still on the bus but it's spring. The nature around is even more beautiful, with a lot of birds in the air and a more animals up and about. I saw a 4-legged animal that caught my attention, but I only saw it from behind, against the sun. It had a familiar silhouette, and then I realized that it's my favorite Pokémon Swampert! And then I thought about all the ""animals"" and ""birds"" I saw before, and realized that they were all Pokémon! The monkeys were Aipoms, the deer was a Stantler, the birds were Pidgeys, etc. I was actually on a tour in Safari Zone! I remember dreaming that I was riding a Tauros and having an eating contest with Snorlax. The last thing I remember was getting punched by a Hitmonchan which made me wake up. Stupid Hitmonchan. 

Anyways, if anyone else had similar dreams feel free to share. I'm always up for a Pokémon story."

1- Pikachu's voice:
We always saw him as a cute little animal who made a soft, cute sound... but now he sounds like a 40 year old man who is on a mission 

2- too much handholding... this game is only meant for kids and preteens... you have to spot the obvious stuff... it makes the game too easy and not challenging at all... which defeats the purpose of a ""game""

3- I dont feel like I'm playing a game... 
I feel like im just pressing a selection of buttons until one of them turns out to be correct,

4- its slow and gets boring because of that... if you do something wrong, you have to go through the long and painful cutscenes over and over...


Of course i cant judge a game without fully playing it... but thats the purpose if a demo... so you can know what the game will be like, i would love to hear your opinions"

pokemon,My opinion on the pseudos
pokemon,My mom made and decorated Pokémon cookies!
pokemon,"For me, it's **Stantler.** 

&amp;#x200B;

It's stupid because it just doesn't look right...the chubby bulldog-like face, the round tail that almost looks like a swollen butt cheek, the weirdly shaped antlers (though I kind of like the antlers), etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, reindeer are one of my most favorite animals after dinosaurs and tigers/wolves. And Stantler fulfills the role of the reindeer Pokemon very well if you ask me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deerling/Sawsbuck look much cooler/better overall, but they're just regular deer, not ""reindeer."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, I absolutely love Christmas, and Stantler just reminds me so much of Christmas. The Shiny form also helps, since it's green, the color of elves, and has a deep red nose. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I find the Pokedex descriptions of it quite interesting, especially ones where it mentions Stantler distorting reality or aiding in sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Stantler could've been much better if only given a slight buff to stats and a Psychic Typing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the GSC sprites of Stantler are easily my favorites. The darker brown and bluish nose/antler orbs made it look much more intimidating and badass to me than the later sprites."

pokemon,"I caught a Ghastly a few minutes ago and was trying to think of a good thoughtful nickname for him since his evolutionary line is one of my top three favorites. Obviously he wouldn’t be Ra or something like him, and something like Anubis would make more sense. But Dusknoir is more like Anubis, since Dusknoir leads lost souls to rest (is that correct?). Also Lucario looks a ton like Anubis, but I don’t think he actually does anything like Anubis. So Gengar can’t be Anubis. I’m not super well versed in Egyptian mythology, and I tried to find a thread like this online but couldn’t find one. Anyways, my question is do any of you have more knowledge of Egyptian gods than me? I’d love to name as many Pokémon as I can after the gods that they represent the best.

pokemon,"I think that if Serena were to go to Alola, first she would see the pokemon school and check it out, then she gets a tour. When she gets to Kukui's class, she sees Ash with Mallow Lana and Lillie. She gets a bit jealous and tries to hide, but fails and when Ash sees Serena he welcomes her. Serena eventually joins Kukui's class and everyone loves her sylveon. The next day after school everyone meets at the beach and Serena does one of those special shows she did in XY. She eventually in class learns about Z-Moves and she is interested. She then goes to Hala to try to win a pokemon battle. She loses, but in around 3 days she tries again and wins. When she gets her Z-ring and Z-crystal Lillie and Mallow congratulate her, the next day after school, goes onto the beach again with pancham to do a Z-move, and other people from melemele island that were on the beach saw her Z-move, and she becomes very popular among the island.

I'm mostly asking because I'd like to keep a Dragonair on my team, but I'd also like to know how it compares to just using a Dragonite."

Type: Steel
Category: Special
Damage: 140
Effect: Does major damage but reduces user's Hit Points by 50%
The entries are needing to be no more than 8 characters long using Katakana, Hiragana or English and people have until May 10th 2019 to enter. The overall winner will receive both Pokémon Sword &amp; Pokémon Shield while 20 runners up will get one copy of the game

So this is the first bit of new news we have gotten for SWSH since the reveal and seems like an interesting move.  Could be one of the Legendaries Sigs or could be something else we don't know but news is news at least."

pokemon,"I love Pokémon. I really do. A world populated by animals that have internal powers and love using their internal powers for sport the way huskies love to run. I love that there’s a mouse that creates lighting, a bird that’s part cloud, a small lil reptile that slowly grows a tree on its back as it gets older. That’s dope and it really feels like a world where these magnificent creatures replace animals. But then Pokémon like Machoke, Gardevoir, Alakazam, Blastoise, etc completely throw it off for me. Why are they humanoid? Are they supposed to be animals or not? Why do they have manmade-looking parts like clothes, wrestling belts, and cannons? Pokémon seem to be divided between animals and psuedo humans, not to mention the assortment of sentient objects, and it somewhat throws me off. It’s not even a matter of running out of ideas, since Gen 1 included a lot of Pokémon like this, and I’d argue that it kind of makes it difficult to enjoy the world of the games sometimes."

pokemon,"I have been replaying Pokemon XD lately and one of the things you can do in that game is do battle simulations. Basically, it's a battle puzzle mode. You are put into a certain situation in a battle and you must do certain things in order to win. While on their own, they just a nice little distraction from the main game, it got me thinking....

What if we had the ability to create our own Battle SIMS and share them online? I believe this would add a nice bit of extra content to the game, especially considering that it can result in some brilliant player created content. 

I would design it so the player can only create Battle SIMS using the Pokemon and items they have (they can also set ongoing situations like what the weather is, what the current health for each Pokemon is, etc.). Like Mario Maker's levels, the creator must be able to beat their own SIM before posting it online. I do think the one problem these user created SIMS might have are those that rely on RNG (beat the opponent by getting a critical hit with Zap Cannon while the opponent uses Air Slash with a King's Rock!).

Players could also be rewarded for playing and creating SIMS. While beating a SIM might grant a small reward such as berries, shards, or simply prize money, if someone makes a Battle SIM that becomes very popular, they can get bigger rewards such as stat boosting items, Big Nuggets, and of course, free Master Balls. 

So, what do you think of this idea? Would it be cool to bring back Battle SIMS and allow players to create and share their own? What ridiculous Battle SIMS would you create?"

pokemon,Pretty accurate adaptation if you ask me
pokemon,"We all know about the times when you get an unlucky crit that wipes out a precious Pokemon of yours (Especially via Nuzlocke), the clutch moments in competitive battling where you barely survive a powerful attack, and so on. With 7 generations of Pokemon, there are a large variety of moves, items, abilities, and species that can make the difference between a win and a loss. My question is: What is the highest and lowest possible damage a Pokemon can make with a single attack, both in legal and illegal terms. To define illegal, I mean Pokemon having moves or abilities that normally are impossible to recieve, such as Wonder Guard on a Spiritomb, or Necrozma's signature move - Photon Geyser - on a Caterpie. I will update this with any important findings. But to start, I will find the highest-damage moves for Physical/Special attack, and their respective type's strongest Pokemon in said stat (Overall, and in terms of learning it).

&amp;#x200B;

The formula to calculate damage is also included, based on Bulbapedia. The variables are as follows:

* Level - The attacking Pokemon's level
* A - The attacking Pokemon's Physical or Special Attack stat (Ignore negative stat changes for a crit), typically from the max/min stat with the respecive nature.
* D - The defending Pomemon's Physical or Special Defense (Crit specs apply too, as well as nature)
* Power - The chosen move's power listed in it's description.
* Modifier = Targets \* Weather \* ~~Badges~~ \* Critical \* Random \* STAB \* Type \* Burn \* Other
   * Targets - If hits more than one target, equal to .75, otherwise 1. (Will default this to 1, in the case of Single Battles)
   * Weather - 1.5 to Water type moves in Rain or Fire type moves in Sunlight, 0.5 to Water type moves in Sunlight and Fire type moves in Rain. 
   * (Badge is only applied in Generation 2, so omitted)
   * Critical - 1.5 if a critical hit, otherwise 1 (Crits dealt 2x until Gen 6)
   * Random - Any value between .85 and 1.00 (We'll use the max/min respectively)
   * STAB - Same Type Attack Bonus; if the move is the same type as the Pokemon, it equals 1.5 (2 with Adaptability), otherwise 1.
   * Type - The effectiveness of the move. 0 for No Effect, 0.25 for Quad Resist, 0.5 for Normal Resist, 1 for Neutral, 2 for Normal Weakness, 4 for Quad Weakness. (Some moves like Forest's Curse can extend beyond this, resulting in 6x or .125x)
   * Burn - 0.5 to Physical Attack if they are burned, don't have Guts, and don't use Facade. 1 otherwise.
   * Other - Any other multipliers that are less frequent, like items. Examples include
      * Expert Belt: \~1.2 for Super-Effective attacks (Held by attacker)
      * Life Orb: \~1.3 for attacker
      * Chillan and other Type-Resist Berries: 0.5 for the type it affects.
      * Fluffy: .5 for non-Fire, contact moves. 2 for non-contact, Fire moves.
      * Multiscale/Shadow Shield: .5 if defender is at max health
      * Filter/Prism Armor/Solid Rock: .75 for Super-Effective attacks (On defender). Tinted Lens works similar, equal to 2 if Not Very Effective (On attacker)
      * Astonish/Body Slam/Dragon Rush/Extrasensory/Flying Press/Heat Crash/Heavy Slam/Needle Arm/Phantom Force/Stomp: 2 if the target used Minimize previously.
      * Earthquake/Magnitude: 2 if the target is underground (Via Dig). Surf and Whirlpool are the same with Dive.
      * Z-Moves: .025 if the target is protected.
      * Aurora Veil/Light Screen/Reflect: 0.5 for non-crit moves and if the user does not have Infiltrator. (Aurora Veil does not stack with the other two. Light Screen for Special, Reflect for Physical)."

pokemon,"There is some way (legitimate as illegitimate) to restore states/versions with data from a valid (legitimate) Poké Bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago the SD card of my (Old) 3DS XL got corrupted and I had to format it losing a very important savegame. The Pokémon Ruby Omega game (2014) where I had transferred all my Pokémon from my original Pokémon Ruby, FireRed, Emerald, Pearl, SoulSilver, Black (1) and Y Pokémon video games editions. It was also a long and tedious process to transfer from generation to generation to my Pokémon Ruby Omega.

&amp;#x200B;

 For this task I did used Nintendo's Pokémon Bank at the time. I lost 12+ years of data and childhood memories. I wanted to know if you guys (or if there's a way I can do by myself) had a chance to restore a previous state/version of my Pokémon Bank account from when I had all my Pokémon there. It would be very important and valuable for me to recover them.

&amp;#x200B;

 I even made a [long post](https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/as5alc/ive_lost_12_years_of_pok%C3%A9mon/) just to receive some emotional support few weeks ago.

pokemon,"Growing up I used to love playing Pokemon, and I would play it literally at any point during the day when I had time available. It has sort of stick to me ever since, and I still feel very emotional about it. I’ve also been wanting to build a very specific fitness app, one that lets you play podcasts while you lift and automatically shifts to music when you rest. I realised you can get through a whole episode in a workout if you combine all the time spent lifting. So since I’m such a Pokemon nerd I try to bring in as much influence from that world as possible. You start with a basic avatar, and it levels up and evolves the more you train. I also plan to add a rival that challenges you to lift.

pokemon,My reaction to the new Detective Pikachu commercial
pokemon,"So I was about to make this post suggesting a Breath of Wild themed Pokemon Game before finding out about Pokemon Sword/Shield.

Though this game dips into 3D well, I feel like a different game with more freedom and less of the same mechanics could be pretty cool, a more sandbox version without a story you HAVE to do.

In this freedom version of Pokemon, you could visit all the previous continents (or start in any known), or islands, regions where the majority of Pokemon originated, and though there might be others kinds found there, primarily for each region, the Pokemon appearing would be of that region.

With it being open to the many previous continents, you could collect badges for each continent, and hold championships that declare you tops in each region before moving onto the next.

With that, the levels would have to scale with progress, but maybe it could take the average level of your party Pokemon for that part. (perhaps make level not top out at lv.100)

Another feature that could be great in this different type of Pokemon game would be the freedom to just go to another region before finishing the current.

Imagine going to Kanto, getting 2 badges, then going to get one in Johto, then stop by Alola for a few.

The story arc bleeding into the progression of badges to fighting the final champions is a bit overdone now, even though they desperately try to keep it fresh.

Additionally to those mechanics changes, Legendary Pokemon could appear in the wild less like an event, and more like the ""shiny"" Pokemon mechanic of the wild. They would still be really hard to catch, and might catch you unaware and unprepared, but if defeated to fainting could show up again in the wild until caught.

Breeding could be elevated past the ""walk-to-hatch"" mechanic. Instead, it could be that the egg hatches and remains with the parents until ready to be taken out. I mean, why would you make a baby fight right away? While in the family center, you could interact with them and play with the baby Pokemon.

This is another interesting flex to the mechanics, but I doubt it would be popular: Karma level

Sure, this is a game for kids, though many adults are sure to play is as well since it's just been around for soooo long.

Imagine not being stifled by one Master ball to a game. If it cost a ton of mulah, and it lowered your karma level, you could just go along and keep using it to play a less childish version of the game.

With this comes possibility for Pokemon to wear multiple items, while lowering your karma level and their happiness level. If happiness zeros out, they could run away from anxiety, a tomodachi effect without death. Imagine stumbling upon your own Pokemon in the wild after the happiness zeros out. There could be a way to still coax the pokmon to come back to you, or it could be only aggressive toward you. There is much possible emotions and untapped potential in this area of the game, but yes, for ""kids"" would avoid such things.

I know Pokemon is a large universe, but a game like this could take it to the next level, if GameFreak and Nintendo would ever allow such leaps. This could be just another idea among millions like it. I'm sure others have suggested these changes, or similar, by other media than written word.

Do you have any other ideas that Pokemon could benefit from? Comment below, if you'd like."

pokemon,"Since Ghetsis is a heartless evil bastard who doesn't care about others no way he'd be able to use mega evolution so I have a couple ideas for how he could use it when we eventually get gen 5 remakes or sequels.


First option

Since team plasma had some scientist working for them they could have created a device that can force mega evolution without Friendship or a Mega stone which ghetsis would use on his Hydreigon.

Since Ghetsis would be able to mega evolve his Hydreigon without a mega stone it can hold another item like a Life orb.

Mega evolved Pokemon holding a Life orb would be a nightmare to deal with which would basically be cheating on his part which he already did since his Hydreigon is underleveled.

Second option this one would only work for a remake.

They pull an Adaptational heroism  which would make Ghetsis less evil than his original self since remakes take place in an alternate timeline as shown in the Delta episode in Oras so as a result he would care about his Pokemon enough to use mega evolution.

pokemon,"With Gen 8 just around the corner, obviously a lot of new Pokemon are inevitable in Sword and Shield. That being said, every generation's set of Pokemon have included clear generational patterns: an early-game mammal, an early-game bird, a Pikaclone, two fossil lines (usually), and a pseudo-legendary. Let's run down a few of these patterns and what I personally would like from each:

&amp;#x200B;

Early-game mammal:

I don't expect much from this other than that it will likely be a Normal-type and not particularly memorable. I don't think it will be good competitively either considering almost none of them are very good, except for Diggersby and Linoone.

Regional bird:

This is going to have a lot to live up to. We've had a lot of great ones both battle-wise and design-wise over the years, namely Staraptor, Swellow, and Talonflame who all have cool designs and great perks in the competitive scene in at least some tier. Hopefully it at least has an interesting gimmick like Toucannon and Noctowl do, and ends up being better than Unfezant (LOL). I've heard some people wanting it to be a Steel/Flying type, which would be interesting: Pelipper and Talonflame are the only early-game birds so far that haven't been part Normal-type, and the early-game bird having a fantastic defensive type and maybe being defensively oriented would be cool (but would have to stand out from Skarmory and Celesteela to be good).

Fossils:

We're likely to get a pair of these in Galar. Since Galar is based a bit on the UK, hopefully we get two new dinosaurs: if we're going UK based, the Ichytosaur and the Plesiosaurus are two dinosaurs that haven't been Pokemon-ified yet, so they'd make magnificent fossil Pokemon. 

Pseudo-legendary:

Most of the ones over the generations have been Dragon-type, except Tyranitar and Metagross. Honestly, I'd like to see Galar take a deviation from the Dragon-type and introduce a different typed pseudo-legendary: I'd personally love an Ice-type pseudo, especially since Northern Galar where the late-game stuff is appears to be very cold and mountainous, making a fitting climate for an Ice-type pseudo-legendary line to be introduced. Perhaps have it benefit from hail as well, such as with Slush Rush, making it a fantastic offensive sweeper that hits hard and has a great offensive movepool (which is something the Ice-type needs badly: a well built offensive Pokemon with a good movepool). In any case, I am greatly looking forward to the next pseudo-legendary: they are always well designed, powerful, and interesting and it'll be really cool to see what Sword and Shield's pseudo will offer.

Pikaclone:

I just want this to be cute if nothing else. These almost always suck in battle, though Togedemaru wasn't total garbage at least and is good both in-game SM/USM and in lower tier play, so who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, feel free to discuss what you all want from each of the generational patterns: I'm interested in seeing what ideas you guys have for the patterns. We'll see how these turn out once Sword and Shield actually come out and as more information rolls in over time, but I do hope the new Pokemon end up being very interesting."

pokemon,"I've been thinking about doing a Steel monotype run in Pokemon Moon version, and while I have 5 mons out of 6, I can't seem to nail down what the 6th should be.

So many choices to be made, so few spots. 4 members of the team are absolute musts, so that means the one mon I'm willing to trade out is Mawile. Any ideas? Thanks in advance."

This is something we should be talking about. These people, who have power and influence in the community, are abusing their positions to groom and sexually exploit minors. Pokemon is a game with a very wide age range, which makes this even more dangerous. You have adult fans who are able to take advantage of their shared interests to make advances towards minors, and, as seen in the videos, have been able to pretty much manipulate them into a relationship.

It baffles me that this sub isn’t discussing this. This is a real world issue that can tear the community apart. Sure, it may not affect you directly, but how the fuck am I supposed to get my little brother to become a part of a community that allows Pedophiles to thrive???

Sorry for the long rant, I’m just really frustrated with this whole situation. Hopefully this sheds some light into this darker side of the community, and raises awareness to the real messed up stuff that goes on here.

Tl;Dr: Poketubers are using their positions of influence in a community full of minors to groom and sexually exploit minors; aka Pedophilia."

I am -this- close to calling and abusing them for this obvious mistake in booking. Like I am insulted. The pokemon community should be insulted. Hell its even rated requiring parental guidance and I aint getting out of bed before the crack of noon for my kids to see it with me."

pokemon,"This might be a bit of a novel so there will be a TLDR at the end but here goes,

So I was going through all my old stuff and I began to find all my old Pokémon games. I bought a refurbished Ds lite so I could look at all my old saves and maybe play some of them again. I started a new save of soul silver as it was my favourite (obviously) but I was finding it a bit easy. I came to the realisation that this game was made for children and would probably not be particularly enjoyable, so I looked on the internet to see what I could do to make the game more interesting. I learned about nuzlockes, unitype teams, and many others, but the thought of doing a catchem all really intrigued me.

I realised that there were lots of Pokémon that I seemed to remember being unobtainable so I looked on the internet but the more I dug the smaller the list got. I was a reallll Pokémon fanatic when I was a kid and literally bought all the merchandise, games, spjnoffs, etc that I could get my hands on, even the stuff that was made before I was born! (I was born in 2001). I found my old copy of Pokémon ranger which ticks manaphy off the list, and after digging my old Wii out I found out I still have Pokémon ranch, which I was ecstatic about! So that ticks off phione and mew I'm pretty sure, although I'm not sure if you can transfer Pokémon from the ds to the Wii and vice versa since they tuned off the WiFi for those devices. I also have a gamecube, and a copy of Pokémon colesium with the ruby and sapphire disc still in tact. 

I also have pretty much have multiples of every Pokémon game that can be transferred all the way to the latest versions although past black and white I stopped properly playing so think I have some of the versions but not all. I have a gameboy, 2 Ds consoles,  (once of which has a broken top screen but is still usable to trade) and a 3ds 

I don't know 100% what Pokémon are completely and utterly unobtainable legitimately. Through research it seems as though dyoxics and maybe some others would be but if any experts could advise it would be immensely appreciated as I'm just a kid who stopped playing years ago but is looking to tackle this monumental task.

I'm also contemplating streaming the whole experience or putting the videos on YouTube as a step by step guide on how to do it with a file for Pokémon ranch that hopefully I could rip from my Wii so others could download it and get mew.

Sorry for the book but many thanks in advance to any of your answers!

Walnut 

TL;DR Please advise on any Pokémon that are 100% unobtainable through any legitimate means that would prohibit me from doing a complete catchem all without glitches or hacks"

pokemon,"For real. Gen 4's line-up is also really good and I have extra nostalgia for it since it was not only my first Pokemon game but also probably my first ""real"" videogame that wasn't some edutainment thing, but honestly, Gen 7 blows it out of the park.

Instead of telling you how great it is, lemme give some of my favorite examples

**The Tapus:** The most thematically cohesive, competitively viable secondary legendary group since the Legendary Dogs. They feel so organic and fitting for Alola itself, and they revitalized a forgotten gimmick from Gen 6 and exploited it to be monsters in battle.

**The Ultra Beasts:** All of them. All of them are weird, freaky and unique: Game Freak took the alien concept to heart and went balls to the wall with these guys' designs and I love it.

**Silvally:** Another great concept with equally compelling lore and role in the story. Now, if only they didn't screw up the balancing part and made him actually good.

**Kommo-o:** The best pseudo-legendary. Compared to stuff like Salamence and Garchomp, Kommo-o has a more regal and dignified sort of cool: he looks a wise teacher, training the next generation of young fighters in his spare time. Also: Dragon. Fighting. He's actually my second favorite Pokemon of all time behind...

**Drampa:** The perfect Pokemon. The ultimate combination of endless charm, endearing, adorable lore and sheer badassery. Normal/Dragon was a type that people had speculated the possibilities of for years prior to SM's release, and they totally nailed it. And while his other faults may hold him down, it won't ever be not hilarious how this old man dragon has raw special strength that surpasses the likes of Latios, Tapu Lele, Magearna, Hydreigon and both of the Gen 6 mascot legends. ~~Infidels~~ Other people may call him weird or too goofy, but he'll always be my special boy to the point where my biggest fear for Sword and Shield is that Game Freak will make something that surpasses him. 

But even discounting the ultimate lifeform, Gen 7's dex is still incredible. Do you agree with me, or do you think other generations have had a better dex?"

pokemon,"I thought that “I Choose You” was supposed to be some kind of cinematic reboot, but then “The Power of Us” kind of stands all alone (which was kind of disappointing, considering the title is OBVIOUSLY a call-back to the title of the second movie, “The Power of One”), and now the next animated film is going to be a remake of the first movie, which - unless they alter some portion of it to tie in with either ICY or TPOU - puts that movie on its own/in the previous continuity.

I know that the movies don’t always have an EXACT point in the anime’s continuity, but they’ve always been vaguely related to each other, and so the films themselves have a kind of continuity (at the very least when it comes to supporting characters and Ash’s current team). I was on board for a cinematic reboot of the anime while the TV show did its own funky little Sun &amp; Moon thing, but now is that not even happening?

Are we stuck in a bunch of weird one-off limbo as long as we’re in the Alola region/Gen 7?

I’m excited for the next movie, but I just feel like I’m being tossed random ideas and projects. I miss the cohesiveness I used to feel from the anime.

Best thing is: there were some Pokemon games.

Fire Red, Gold, Ruby and Emerald.

I used to play the Crystal Version, when I was a kid, so thought starting with Fire Red as a remake of the first Generation would be smart and I had a lot of fun with it. Now I'm almost finished (training for the second run on the Elite Four) and got to wonder what a good order to move on would be.

Gold? - As I said I've played Crystal before.

Or should I skip to Ruby or Emerald?

As there are no mechanics f.i. like breeding-mechnic in Fire Red... are there many mechanics in Ruby/Emerald that would make it hard, if I don't play Gold again?

Also there is even a GBC that my brother in law has left.... is it possible to trade pokemon between GBC and GBA? I would love to put my Charizard/Mewtwo/Jolteon to my next team."

pokemon,"I’m only wondering because I’ve been binge watching the Sinnoh episodes, and one such episode I came across was Stopped in the Name of Love. In the episode, Dawns Piplup refuses to evolve because he didn’t want to change and thought Dawn wouldn’t accept him, so Dawn got Nurse Joy to let him touch an Everstone. Okay, that’s all well and good. But say for arguments sake Piplup or Dawn changed their minds somewhere down the line and decided Piplup should become a Prinplup. Can he do that? Is there any way to reverse it or is he forever destined to be a Piplup? 

In the games, the effects of an Everstone aren’t permanent, since you just give it to your Pokémon to hold, and they aren’t single use. If you give it to your Magnemite because you want it to learn a certain move, but decide later on you want a Magneton but not a Muk, you just take the Everstone away and give it to your Grimer. 

The anime does ignore certain aspects of the games, like the concept of levels or the concepts of PPs. With levels, yes, a Pokémon can become stronger and with PPs they might tire during a fight, but since Pokémon fighting is like a sport, it differs. What I mean is, yes, Pikachu is powerful as a Pokémon and if the concept of levels existed in the games he’d be level 100, but since with sports you have to spend so much time training, he takes a long enough break between regions that he loses his strength. Meanwhile in the games, you can have a level 100 charizard and it won’t lose its power. 

I’m only asking because yes, what if something happens like a Pokémon touches an Everstone but doesn’t know it is such? Is that Pokémon SOL? Do you just touch it with another Everstone?"

On Mewtwo's shoulders two joints sit, which clearly extend further into those appendages, as shown later. Why are they there? What are they for? How's it better looking compared to the original? I leave iz to you to decide, my dear Trainers. Let's move on to the next oddity.

Not only is this armor strange, to say the least, it's also very frail. First of all, these strips are a joke. As you can see in the Original and in that lovely concept art they used to be pretty bulky. And it is very reasonable, as in this Universe we have flying lizards, that can melt everything with thier fire, Goddesses (or Gods, it's up to you) of Time, Space and Gravity and Out of Bounce creatures, that are living black holes. We also don't want Mewtwo to take of his armor that easily, so an extra durability to those strips is vital. In the remake, however, they decided to put the set together with backpack belts... It's a very bad expense item, Giovanni, to make budget cuts on. Well, at least now ""we truely know"" why Mewtwo didn't found the escape problematic.

The last detail (so far) which sucks (from safety point on you... Not only, really, but mostly it, of course) is the chest plate. As you can see, in the Original it fully coveres Mewtwo's bone plate. Again, this is very nice, as the armor, according to the Japanese version, is meant to protect Mewtwo's body (as well as suppress his powers, but it's not important for now), and, you know, keeping your chest safe is something to care about. The original armor set accomplishes its main tasks way better than the redesigned one.

The latter has a couple of undoubtedly cool new details. Mewtwo holds his knuckles as shields now, which wasn't the case in the original. And they put a bit more colorful spots here and there. 

Well, that all for now. Feel free to leave your ideas in the comments! See you!"

But they often feel very same-y, and easy when players can blast through them with a single Pokemon with a type advantage.

___

**Normal / Fighting Duo Gym**

*Team Badge*

A 2v2 double battle gym encouraging players to catch a second Pokemon.

Potentially someone in the town could give them a choice of three eggs containing rare Pokemon, each hatching a baby Pokemon, and players may use that as their sidekick.

If the game wanted to encourage players to use more Pokemon early, this could be the first badge.
____________________________________________________________________________

**Dark / Bug Gym**

*Swarm Badge*

Swarm theme where you fight six Pokemon 1v2, against a three pairs of stronger main opponents and weaker supportive opponents.

Supporters are of previous evolutions, and they focus on debuffs and conditions like poison, paralysis, and string shot. The main ones may Dig.
______________________________________________________

**Dragon / Ghost Gym**

*Brave Badge*

Double team Pokemon in 2v1 battles where they receive a stat buff or levels, the opposite of the Swarm Gym.
_____________________________________________________________

**Grass / Fire / Water Gym**

*Weather Badge*

Rotation battle against 6 Pokemon where the weather constantly alternates between Harsh Sunlight and Rain.

Enemy Grass pokemon will favor abilities that benefit from harsh sunlight while it lasts.

Castform probably makes an appearance.

________________________________________________________________

**Ground/ Rock Gym**

*Megaton Badge*

Triple battle with a constant Sandstorm effect. The enemies will use some defensive strategies, like Dig and defense boosts, but they won’t all be protecting at the same time.
________________________________________________________________

**Ice / Flying**

*Peak Badge*

Standard single battle format, with two rival gym leaders cooperating.

First you fight ice types with a Hail effect, and then it is replaced by an enemy Tailwind effect when the flying trainer’s three Pokemon are reached.
__________________________________________________________

**Steel / Electric**

Copper Badge

Double battle in a hazardous arena with Electric Terrain and a passive Stealth Rocks effect.
_______________________________________________________________

**Fairy / Psychic**

*Cheer Badge*

Standard single battle where Trainer items are banned, but players can choose one of three random items to use every two turns.
These vary between weak potions, full heals, and stat boosters."

But imagine how much more it could have been. Imagine you, Hilbert, and N all coming together at last. Imagine a battle with the new strongest NPC; a callback to the historic battle with Red. And finally, the three of you resurrect the world's most powerful hero.

I really love the franchise for so many things it has done. It's *because* I love it so much, that I want to see it improve and fill its incredible, partially untapped potential. Over the past few months I've been gathering some ideas for an alternative take on the Pokemon world, how things could work in it, and how gameplay could change to be more nuanced and enjoyable, at least from my point of view. Maybe some of you would like the ideas as well, maybe not. I thought I'd share them either way, if at least for the sake of having them written down somewhere rather than just flowing ambiguously in my mind, prone to be forgotten. All civil discussion is absolutely welcomed, and ideas for improvement are more than encouraged.

**Small disclaimer:** a lot of the ideas I'm going to put forth might make it seem like I'm deliberately striving for a more ""realistic"" version of the world of Pokemon, but that is not my intention. I do not wish to pull away from its wonder and supernatural elements. Rather, I want to make those aspects more consistent to their theme, more believable, more lively. For the sake of explaining my ideas, I'm going to refer to the potential alternative take of the world of Pokemon in my mind as ""the potential world"", and to the current franchise's world of Pokemon as ""the current world"". When I write ""partner Pokemon"", I don't refer to the specific 'monogamous' bond between a trainer and their 'main' Pokemon, but rather, to any bond between a trainer and any one of their Pokemon.

# Overall Franchise

Save for a few minor spin-off entries&gt;! (which receive substantially less funding and have less production value than main series games)!&lt; and mini-games in the main series, the main role of Pokemon in the human character's journey is to be trained for battle, and to battle. While combat is definitely a very compelling system for video games, and has worked phenomenally for the franchise thus far, **why is it the only prominent style of gameplay that receives the spotlight?**

Already in the lore of the current world, Pokemon are depicted as potentially helpful for many other fields of activity in life, and even as pets or life partners merely for company. I'm sure many of us, whether only as kids or even as adults, wish Pokemon were real and were integrated in our lives in many ways. I think the Pokemon world is lush with potential for more types of video game series of different genres. **So many more fields of life, types of competition, and gameplay styles could be explored and enjoyed in video games with Pokemon beyond just combat,** in my opinion. Games focusing on research, breeding, nature exploration, large scale ecology, sports, social life, point and click adventures, talent competitions, crafting, the list of options goes on... Pokemon could be an amazing theme for educational games, too. We already have in front of us a prime example for a Pokemon media piece of enormous production value that seems like it's going to be a worldwide success - Detective Pikachu (the movie).

If there's any company that has the resources and the creativity to produce outstanding games, it's Nintendo, and fortunately for Nintendo, it already has one of the most popular franchises to do it with, in Pokemon. What's more, we've already seen Nintendo provide intellectual property rights to other developers in order to create interesting and successful titles.

Within the main series games, in terms of competitive combat capabilities, **only a very small portion of all Pokemon are represented well enough**. Different areas of life and gameplay styles could give **equal attention to a much wider variety of Pokemon** who shine in different fields and for different purposes.

# Lore

When examining wild Pokemon in their natural habitat, everything seems pretty much equivalent to the way the animal kingdom operates in our world. On the other hand, there are a few key points that have been bothering me about **the way Pokemon, as the equivalents of animals in the current world, are integrated into the lives of trainers.**

&amp;#x200B;

\- For a start, let's tackle the notion that in the current Pokemon world, trainers can, in a sense, force a certain Pokemon to be trained by them and to participate in battles for them, if they wanted badly enough to capture said Pokemon, even if that Pokemon is not fully willing.&gt;! (Rare exceptions exist) !&lt;In other words, in many cases, **trainers choose their Pokemon one-sidedly**, and the only choice the Pokemon has in the matter is whether or not they're fine with their new life. This also suggests that the trainer necessarily has a certain level of authority over its Pokemon, hence the title ""trainer"", rather than ""partner"". I find that **this value conflicts directly with the message that the Pokemon franchise attempts to deliver**, namely that humans and Pokemon should be friends, work together, and enrich each other's lives.

**What if, in the potential world, Pokemon and humans had to choose each other mutually in order to have a symbiotic bond and to cooperate?** Pokemon could have different values that determine how compatible each one is to the human who interacts with it. Different criteria to determine that **percentage of compatibility** at random, could be: species, nature, gender, level, evolution stage, the human's appearance, other Pokemon already accompanying the human... followed by more values that have yet to be introduced to the series, such as: degree of interest in battles &gt;!(or any other field of life the human wishes to apply the Pokemon to)!&lt;, the human's personality, etc. Players will have to accept that their character, just like any other human, is not automatically entitled to have a successful bond with every Pokemon they encounter. Moreover, the human's treatment to Pokemon that they've already teamed up with, could affect the Pokemon's willingness to stay with them in the future. We already know of Pokemon within the lore who explicitly don't tolerate trainer maltreatment to them, such as Ninetales.

**Moreover, people wouldn't necessarily need to have a lasting compatible bond with a Pokemon just in order to research it and learn more about it (for example, registering it in their Pokedex)**. Learning new data on a Pokemon for the Pokedex could happen from short, friendly encounters with it, perhaps in a symbiotic exchange.

This also alleviates the issue of Legendary Pokemon &gt;!\- beings of one of their kind (rare exceptions exist) -!&lt; being captured by just one trainer throughout the entirety of the world, and staying captured. **Legendary Pokemon could act true to their title and remain abnormally elusive and mysterious, letting only those they deem 'worthy' (not necessarily in terms of power) to have contact with them and learn more about them, perhaps even partner up with them for a short period of time.** It could take multiple encounters or a very special favor towards a Legendary Pokemon in order for it to allow a human to register it in their Pokedex. In terms of game design, they could act more so as critical ""NPCs"" than as standard partner-material Pokemon.

I believe much **more nuanced and immersive stories** can be crafted and told in such a world, and as a bonus, the **personal connections** between people (the players) and their Pokemon could feel much more **meaningful**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Ever since childhood, I've been bothered by the question **""what does a Pokemon experience when inside a Pokeball?""**. As far as I'm aware, the answer to this question has never been canonically provided by official game designers of the franchise, and so the fans have formulated many theories over the years. While I find some of those theories interesting, **I think the issue is not with that question, but rather, with the concept of the Pokeball itself; storing a sentient creature within a small, mobile container that stores it as ethereal-looking energy**. I assume this concept has been introduced to the franchise in order to make it thematically possible to have any Pokemon, regardless of its size or mobility capabilities, be able to tag along with you anywhere. 

But **what if (in the potential world) some Pokemon were not meant to follow their partners everywhere, and instead would spend most of their time living in their natural habitat, and be summoned to their partners only when needed or wanted?**

Once again, this could allow for more nuanced storytelling, and more interesting design choices. Players would be faced with more reasonable and immersive dilemmas when considering what Pokemon they might want to have around them (physically, conscious) during everyday life &gt;!(if the Pokemon are willing, of course)!&lt;, and what Pokemon should probably stay in their natural habitat for the most part. **The Pokeball could be the device that summons and returns the Pokemon back and forth from their habitat,** rather than a device that keeps them away in unknown limbo.

&amp;#x200B;

# Mechanics

&amp;#x200B;

\- So far, in the main series games, **the story and the adventure has almost always been driven by human characters, and most prominently by the played character and their ambitions.** As it stands right now in the current games, as soon as a Pokemon is captured by a trainer, they're basically subjected to their trainer's goals and directions, and don't initiate any story beats. I think there's a ton of missing potential here. **Pokemon could have their own wants, ambitions, and so on, and therefore create new side quests and unforeseen goals for the human characters.** This would transform Pokemon from somewhat mindless subordinates &gt;!(at least that's the feeling I've been getting)!&lt; into full-fledged interesting characters in and of themselves, and enrich the sense of purpose within the games with more to do and achieve. **Each Pokemon could have a short quest line unique to it, that involves learning more about it, to provide more data for the Pokedex.** Quests could inter-connect with other Pokemon's quests in order to create a web of content that would only end once the Pokedex is absolutely complete. Beyond **adding a lot of unique content to the game**, this also ensures that **players experience a lot more Pokemon species that they wouldn't have otherwise**, effectively creating a more balanced stage for popularity among a wider variety of Pokemon designs.

Side note - I think the idea that some Pokemon, such as the starter Pikachu and Eevee in Pokemon Yellow and Pokemon Let's Go, don't want to evolve at all, is interesting, **and I think it should be explored more.** I see it as an example for a random variable that some Pokemon could have, albeit very rarely in the wild.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This might be a controversial one. There are a few systems in the game that seem to me to do **certain injustices to the educational and emotional values the Pokemon franchise stands for,** and I think they could be handled a lot better. IVs, the hard level cap, some species being naturally stronger than others, etc., are all culprits.

Imagine having a **soft level cap with exponentially decreasing returns, rather than a hard cap**, which would allow you to invest as much time and effort as you wish into any Pokemon you like in order to keep making it stronger and stronger, even if by minuscule gains. That kind of post-soft-cap training could be boosted by the Pokemon's happiness values, and even supplement stats to fill in for non-perfect IVs. **This could allow trainers to keep going with the Pokemon they've gotten attached to, rather than ditch them and breed excessively for perfect specimen. Moreover, players who really love certain Pokemon species that don't naturally excel in battle, could show their love for their Pokemon by training it diligently to rise above other naturally stronger by nature, via merit.** Obviously not all Pokemon species are born equal, but in my opinion, all Pokemon species should have the ability to compete and be relevant, with enough effort.&gt;! (Goku, a low class warrior, trained a tremendous amount and managed to surpass Vegeta, an elite warrior, who probably didn't train as much. Rest assured my Ambipom will one day be able to beat your Salamence!)!&lt;

  
\- Right now in the main series games, **it's possible to keep feeding revives to a Pokemon and spray it with potions for as long as the trainer's supply doesn't run out**. This has always seemed a bit weird to me, especially considering it defeats the purpose of some of the challenges that the games have to offer.&gt;! (looking at you, Elite Four.)!&lt; It also seems somewhat absurd to me that **you can train a Pokemon relentlessly and make it grow very unnaturally quickly, if you simply grind through its levels and visit a Pokemon Center to heal it quickly every few minutes.**

I think it would be an interesting addition to the rules of the game if there was **a limit on how much you can heal a Pokemon by unnatural means before it has to rest**.&gt;! (no, the move ""Rest"" doesn't count.) !&lt;This could encourage players to train more than six Pokemon and have more than one team for the purpose of battles&gt;! (Oddish or Bellsprout... Why not both?!)!&lt;, and **provide a more naturally paced progression curve to the game.**

Side note - also a certain limit on Rare Candy feeding.  


\- **The main series games have stayed rather linear ever since the beginning**. Nintendo has proven that they know how to take a successful video game series, tear its long-practiced formula apart, and create something new and beautiful without many artificial progression boundaries. I think **an open world with level-scaling content could do the franchise wonders**. So far the strength of a trainer in the main series games **has been measured merely by the level of the Pokemon in their possession**. If progression was measured by **trainer experience and level** instead, scaling the content's level and difficulty to accommodate them should not be an issue. What's more, it'll open doors to **interesting mechanics and tools based on trainer experience**, and give the game more depth as a result. If the player is free to choose their character's starting location in the world, and where to venture off to, **countless different unique experiences could be told between players, provide more reasons to play the entire game multiple times, and enrich the fanbase with wonder.** 

Side note - Pokemon is a game series that has always promoted the idea of **playing with and against friends**. In fact, a lot of players would attest that their most memorable and enjoyable moments with the franchise were when they played together with others. However, so far there hasn't been a solid thematic way to present such interactions besides through rather dull menus and animations. **An open world would be excellent ground** for players to play in co-op (each from their own console) and perhaps even encounter other online players at random to interact, trade, and battle with. &gt;!(all level-scaled to each other via passive level matchmaking)!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lastly, I'm honestly baffled that we still have to ask for **multiple save files** at this point. This would allow for players to experiment with different approaches in their play styles, and more importantly, give family members and close friends the ability to dabble with the game without having to delete any progress. Maybe Pokemon Sword and Shield will surprise us with this one. I like to stay optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR section! Summary of all key suggestions:

**General:**

**1.** Games with a wider variety of life areas, activities, genres and gameplay features that let all Pokemon shine.

**Lore:**

**2.** Free, symbiotic partnerships and compatibility between Pokemon and humans, rather than one-sided capture decisions and trainer authority over Pokemon. Registering data for the Pokedex can happen without partnering up with a Pokemon, too. Legendary Pokemon are much more elusive and mysterious, and don't partner up for long.

**3.** Pokemon living in their habitats after becoming partners with a human, unless willing and capable of living alongside the human in everyday life. Pokeballs serve as summoning devices rather than as unknown limbo portable containers.

**Mechanics:**

4. Pokemon having personalities, ambitions, preferences, etc., and provide side quests based on their species. 

5. An infinite soft level cap with decreasing returns, to allow low IV Pokemon and species that are not naturally superior in combat to compete based on merit and diligence.

6. A limit on constant use of healing items and Pokemon Centers, letting Pokemon rest naturally once in a while. Also a limit on Rare Candy feeding.

7. An open world with level-scaling progression and very light online multiplayer experience.

8. Multiple save files, pLeASe

pokemon,"This is a story I came up with and I like there could be some grammar errors I'm to lazy to check but here we go. (I got inspired from some poketubers too cough \*Aura Guardian\* Cough)

 

So it all began with an egg, a pokemon egg that is and from that egg came on dragon, too this day no one knows what the name of that dragon was. But as the dragon grew of age so did civilization. The king of this civilization was a greedy man and he wanted the dragon for himself to give to his twin sons. This king was the king of what is now the unova region. It took him 15 years to find the dragon and even then he had to fight the rest of the dragons. Stage one was Dragonite and Salamance, the king took his noblest of pokemon with him. 1 escavialer, 1 bravery, 1 metang, 1 stoutland, and 1 Bertic. The king was to confident and only used his metang in stage 1 and nearly feel in defeat. Stage 2 was 1 Flygon and 1 Garchomp, the 2 kings of the desert used the sandstorm to there advantage. The king used his stoutland that knew ice fang to take out flygon and fell in defeat to garchomp and garchomp disappeared deep into the cave. Garchomp wounded went to the holy dragon and he was furious and grew into a rage. Stage 3 was to the kings shock a kingdra and altaria using the rain to there advantage. The king used his escavialer in this fight and escavialer took both kingdra and altaria but itself in the process, The king had 2 more stages and only had 2 pokemon left he used Braveary in stage 4 which was just 1 druddigon but this druddigon was special because it knew draco meteor and bravery was lucky and escaped it and took it out. Stage 5 the final stage, the king used his Braveary and his beartic. But to the kings surprise there was 3 pokemon hydreigon, haxorus,and Garchomp. But right at the end of the battle it was only haxorus left and he was very weak. The almighty dragon appeared and get haxorus a side to heal and he took out bravery in one hit. It was a very intense battle with the king having to use all his revival herbs and with only beartic left the battle was over both were very weak and the dragon fell in defeat and beartic collapsed on top of the dragon. Suddenly the holy dragon began to burst with light and the became the king’s it went right in to the kings master ball. Back at the castle the king’s twins began to fight over the dragon and who got to keep it when they both left for a journey. With all the chaos the  dragon split into 3 different parts Zekrom, Reshiram, and kyurem as the leftovers. So the brothers kept on dragon and the king kept kyurem and as the time went on the 3 dragons formed the Unova region as we know and love it today."

I'm personally really hoping generation 8 doesn't follow suit in that regard and instead, in comparison to gen 7, has the vast majority of the pokémon evolving at least once.

Despite having some obvious gems, generation 7 felt a bit rushed/incomplete with an unprecedented 14 single stage pokémon in the new dex making it feel like they didn't complete what they started. It's pretty anti-climactic in a series with evolution being the core mechanical theme, it's even more dampening to have an already small generation with a large sum of evolutionless lines. It seems to me that if they'd spent a little more time giving a handful of those 14 single stage Pokémon 1 or 2 additional stages in their line the dex total would've come much closer to 100 and would have felt much more like it could fill a new region than it did.﻿

On top of the 14 normal non-evolving pokémon, there's also about 13 legends/mythicals(excluding ultrabeasts from the count, except for the ones in the grey area.) that make the dex essentially even more shallow from a playthrough standpoint when building a realistic team. This leaves generation 7 with something like 75 Pokémon in total including legends, 62 Pokémon with legends subtracted, 48 Pokémon that belong to actual evolving lines, and only a meager 20 evolutionary lines to choose from in the whole pokédex or 34 ""lines"" with the non-evolving Pokémon added to that number. So, yeah, comparatively very shallow to the games prior to the 3DS era?

Anyways, my intention isn't to just dunk on anyone's personal favorite generation or be inflammatory. Gen 7 did a handful of really cool things and has offered a few pokémon that I consider all-time favorites. Ultimately no generation is perfect and I've always been very open and satisfied through the generations until now. I just haven't really been able to shake this feeling about Alola's dex. I really love Pokémon and it shows through both praise and sometimes passionate criticism, because obviously we all want the qualities we fell for to build and reach new potentials.﻿ People sometimes tend not to want to have these kinds of conversations, but it's not like I think it's a throw away generation or anything.

Thoughts?"
pokemon,"One major change that came about from Generation VII was the removal of HMs. No longer do we have to scratch our heads on how to spread these obstructive hard-to-erase moves around just to progress through the game, and overall I'm glad they're gone. However, it came at the cost of making a group of otherwise terrible Pokemon even more terrible, and I am of course talking about Utility mons. After Gen I and prior to Gen VII, Utility mons were actually pretty reliable. Instead of wasting a move slot for a useless move like Cut and Rock Smash on your favorite Pokemon, you could use your sixth slot to dump as many HMs on Utility mons as you can. Thus, this allows your Nidokings and Espeons to run whichever moves they wanted. And because these Utility mons often evolve early and have a fast learn set, they were decent partners in the early game for your starter. Plus, they often had other useful tricks like having the Pick Up ability (Meowth/Zigzagoon), learning strong status moves (Paras), or being able to learn False Swipe to make catching other Pokemon easier. Gen III and Gen IV was the pinnacle of the Utility Mon, with Zigzagoon, Lotad, Meowth, Tropius, and Bidoof making it in so many players' teams. As the series went on, stronger and stronger mons have been appearing in early game like Sawk and Honedge on top of less HMs being required for progression, so Utility Mons took a notable dip in usefulness. Now in Gen VII when HMs don't exist, Utility Mons have hit rock bottom. Why bother with Yungoose in Route 1 when Alola-Grimer is just one route away? Or Magnemite? Or Furfrou? 

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me sad to see such a big list of Pokemon go from sorta useful to not playable at all, so I wanna see what you guys think can be done to bring Utility Mons back without HM moves."

Arena Trap prevents you from running away or switching out, Destiny Bond kills you off if you fail to one shot him, and Mirror Coat one shots you if you give a huge special blow to him. So far he only appears in two locations with a low encounter rate, which are Mewtwo cave (FR &amp; LG) and Battle Pyramid (Emerald). In Mewtwo cave he gave me a lot of trouble to reach Mewtwo, sometimes I was forced to quit when all my high level pokemon fainted to Destiny Bond or Mirror Coat, but it was manageable; in Battle Pyrimad, however, this guy was a major obstable that caused me stuck in top floors. How am I supposed to deal with him?"

His body looks like a head with his feet being pincers and his ears antenna. The tan circle looks like a giant single eye. I just kind of ignored his actual eyes and mouth as a kid.

Also, why wouldn’t a slug evolve into a ferret? In the world of Pokémon anything could happen and my 10 year old self was willing to believe!

To this day I still can’t unsee the slug I grew up with. Sentret will forever be a cyclops slug to me.

pokemon,"The announcement that they are building a Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan is rife with speculation. So far, we only know that they are going to have a Mario Kart ride, but of course, potential Pokémon rides are the real draw here. Back in 2005 there was a real Pokémon theme park in Japan (and in 2006, one in Taiwan), the rides at that could give us some ideas. I'm hoping they have a whole dedicated Pokémon Land as part of the Nintendo World; if Nintendo World is big enough it shouldn't be too much of an issue? There are also plans to open up Nintendo Worlds at Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. I believe Universal Studios Singapore is in talks to make one as well."

pokemon,"I know a lot of people look down upon the story of Pokémon X/Y, especially when compared to the two gens it is sandwiched between, but hear me out here. Out of the last three gens, the story of X/Y actually had the most emotional impact on me. There’s a lot of potential here- I love the backstory of the Great War 3,000 years ago and how the remnants manage to play their part today. This homeless looming man you met turns out to be the great king from 3,000 years ago. The innocent looking stones near Geosenge Town turn out to be the graves of Pokémon from the war. The literal ultimate weapon from 3,000 years ago erupts from the ground of Geosenge Town and threatens to kill everyone. And the cutscene where AZ talks about Floette almost brought me to tears because the storytelling was so beautifully presented.

The problem with all of this is that it is barely foreshadowed throughout the game so all of these plot twists and reveals just come out of nowhere and lack a true punch. Team Flare just seems like a bunch of bumbling idiots so the declaration that the world is about to end just seems ridiculous. You literally only meet AZ once before the climax, and there’s not much focus on this Great Pokémon War until the climax itself. There’s almost zero focus on Geosenge Town or the stones until the climax.

If the writers decided to have AZ interact with you more often and focus a little more on the mysteries of Kalos’s past and Geosenge Town throughout the story, the end effect could have been much better. This would allow you to contemplate all these mysteries and their connection before the climax, making the reveal of the actual significance of these things much more impactful. AZ’s capture seems meaningless to us if we don’t know his character. Had he really interacted with us this entire game and endeared himself to us it could’ve felt a lot different. In addition, Lysandre needs a complete makeover. It’s cool to play the “evil team leader is someone you never suspected the whole time” card for once, but then they dressed Lysandre so obviously that it made the entire story feel comical.

Honestly, I wish they hadn’t messed up the lead up to the climax in X/Y so much because there’s a lot of substance there that could’ve felt impactful to people had the build up been done better. What are your thoughts?"

pokemon,"Girl at University looks like Bulbasaur, what do y’all think?"
pokemon,"So basically I just want to say furret is the best pokemon and heres are some facts: 

 Furret is a long and slim-bodied Pokémon with brown and cream-colored fur, strongly resembling a ferret. It has two brown lines on each cheek and cream-tipped ears. The back of its head has brown coloration that loosely frames its eyes and terminates into the first of four medium-sized brown rings that range from the middle of its torso to near the end of its tail, making it impossible to tell where its tail actually begins. Its stubby paws all have pink paw pads; its forepaws end in brown while its hind paws are cream. Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs, but prefers to move on all fours. Despite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile. Its speed allows it to catch prey like rattata. It tends to burrow deep in the ground of meadows and other grasslands. Its narrow burrows are well-suited for Furret's slim body, being very difficult for other Pokémon to enter; they also become more maze-like the deeper they go, making it even harder to find its nest. A mother Furret curls itself around its offspring to help them sleep."

pokemon,"Alright if regional forms come back then we have an odd issue, kind of. Now before this we have to assume a few things.

1) They'll probably use only gen 2 pokemon

2) They'll probably ignore the ones that get evolutions later on or get megas

3) They probably won't go for legendaries either, for obvious reasons.

4) If any gen 2 mons are ride pokemon there they probably won't be selected.

Now I want to say that if we look back at what happened with alolan forms they went for pokemon that did not get later evolutions, megas, or were ride pokémon. Now with gen 2 we don't have to worry about the 4th assumption, of they keep the riders the same, however the odd thing about them is the amount. It'll either be 12 or 18. 

Now why do I think this? Well 18/151 is aproxmiately 12 percent, and given that you can't have half a pokemon we're gonna stick with that 12 percent. Now if they keep the same percentage, then it'll be 12 gatalian forms, but if they keep the same amount then it's 18. Honestly I have a feeling they'll go with the lower number just because it's game freak.

My question for y'all is what 12 Johto pokémon are gonna get that Galaxian treatment?"

I’ve never used any of these Pokémon and am unsure of how useful each will be on my team. So far Pikipek was pretty frail, Hawlucha has been a hard hitter, and Cutiefly has been alright stats wise but also very cute (a big factor in team making). Which one should I keep and will contribute as a strong team member? For reference I plan on having a Dewpider and an undecided electric type (suggestions welcome) and I already have a Litten and Zorua."
pokemon,"First up, I want to say I, along with my Mom and Sister when she isn't at College, live with my Grandparents. Also, this may make you cry. Anyway, I want to say it was late 2015 when my Grandparents got a new dog, she was a Chihuahua and Pomeranian mix and she wasn't even a month old when they got her I say. We decided to name her Xena (Zena). I, along wrong the rest of my family loved that puppy soo much. Anyway, it was the Summer of 2016, like the June or July months, that she got really sick. My Grandma brought her to the vet and than they said she just probably not feeling well. She than brought her to another vet after a while. I don't remember how she found out, either the vet told her or she heard it while trying to call the vet on the pre recorded messages that play. Anyway, it turns out that her liver was failing. It turns out that she ate 3 small pieces of a Sago Palm Tree Branch a couple weeks I want to say before we found out. Now, any part of a Sago Palm Tree is extremely deadly to animals, no matter if the Sago Palm Tree is dead or alive. Anyway, so Xena was at the vet for a week or 2 and they tried everything to bring her enzymes levels back because the Sago Palm Tree destroyed her liver. After a week or two, she just got worse. So we decided to bring her back home. A day or two later after we brought her home, she began throwing up black stuff and that night, we all slept in the living room with her. During those 1 or 2 days after we brought her back home, we tried to give her the medicine that the vets gave us to give to her, but she just puked them back up. Anyway, the day after she started throwing up the black stuff, she got really really bad. She was all bloated, her fur was all messed up, her eyes were yellow, she was peeing all over the house (she was house trained) and than she began puking blood. My Grandparents didn't want her to suffer anymore so they brought her to the vet to put her to sleep. I was so sad by her death. You see, I have had dogs for most of my life and I love dogs soo much. So her death hit me very hard. A week or two or a month after her death, I was still hurting from her death. I loved that puppy. She wasn't even a year old when she had to be put to sleep, she was only around 9 months old. Than, Rockruff, who was known as Iwanko, back than, was revealed or leaked through CoroCoro. It was night time and my Mom and Sis was sitting in the living room with me, just chilling, and than I checked Sereibi. And guessed what? They have posted the Coro Coro scans of Iwanko. I looked at this Pokemon and thought ""Oh my goodness, this looks a lot like Xena!"" And it did! Same for color, fluffy tail! I instantly fell in love with this Pokemon. And I would even say that this Pokemon helped me cope through Xena's death. Heck, when Pokemon Sun came out, I used a Rockruff on my first team for that game and guess what I named it? Xena. I love Rockruff soo much and if I could, I would buy every Rockruff merch that they have. Rockruff is one of my most favorite Pokemon of all time, up there with Bisharp and Eevee. Rockruff is probably my 2nd favorite, with Bisharp being my number one favorite and Eevee being my 3rd favorite. And I want to say this as well, if any of you have Sago Palm Trees at your house and have pets or you know anyone who have Sago Palm Trees and pets, please remove the Sago Palm Trees. Those plants are extremely dangerous and deadly to Animals, any part of the plant, no matter if the plant is dead or alive. So yeah, this is why Rockruff means a lot to me. Thank you for reading this, I been wanting to tell everyone why Rockruff means a lot to me. We now have a new puppy who is a Chihuahua Australian Shepherd mix and her name is Chloe. We got her like a month or 2 after Xena died and we still have her."

I hope they bring this back with the next Xbox.

xboxone,"So a bit of background for this(not needed necessarily so if you just want the current problem skip to second paragraph) about two or three months ago the left bumper on my Xbox one elite controller was a little loose so I watched a video and learned how to correctly disassemble the controller, and then tried to solve the problem myself. Long story short, the lip had basically snapped off, how I don’t know but after doing some research I found that it was normal for this to happen. I had already had my controller running strong for a couple years so sure I didn’t mind purchasing a 20 or so dollar new left AND right bumper. 

Fast forward a few months and now there seems to be a problem with my RB. In the middle of an overwatch game I clicked RB and then after that it acted as though I was holding the button down even though I wasn’t touching it. Again watched some videos and read some reddit posts and tried the suggested stuff and nothing worked.  So currently the things I know are

1. My controller is already disassembled and plugged into my computer

2. I have a “emulator” I guess you could call it, but it’s showing when each button is being pressed 

3. My RB has no actual Piece that people typically call the Bumper attached to it right now//// It’s just the “Right Bumper Switch”

4. I can still click the RB Switch and it makes the normal sound a RB would make even though when it should “depress” it does not. 


So to recap, the “Right Bumper Switch” is the only part that is in the general area of the right bumper and even though it looks the exact same height as the perfectly good LB, my computer still reads it as being held in. I can still click the RB button and it makes a sound but obviously it doesn’t change how it looks on the computer since it is still being pushed."
xboxone,"Hi,

I don’t post much so sorry if this is wrong format. Just an issue I cannot find a solution for here or on Microsoft’s site 

I am having an issue with Xbox Live Gold. I recently used a 14 day Gold Trial I received with purchase of my Xbox One to purchase a game with a discount. 

I also wanted to be able to download Star Wars battlefront 2 ( the original Xbox) as it is free with Gold for a few more days and I hear you can play the non Xbox 1 games you get with gold even after your subscription ends (please correct me if mistaken). It shows up being 9.99 rather than free, while it let me download the Xbox one games that are free no issue. 

If it’s an issue with the trial period not being a real subscription that is fine, and I would like to get a one month subscription then to get that game, but there is no way for me to buy a Gold subscription at this point. On a browser or on the Xbox it sends me to manage subscriptions rather than buy, and there is no subscriptions to renew or buy on that page and sends me back to the other page so it’s a endless loop. 

Any advice? Thank you all!"
xboxone,"I hypothetically would like Game Pass if they didn't make such an obvious effort to trap you.

My CC expired, which lead to my account cancelling. Microsoft starts riding me about owing them money. Ok, that seems like a weird system where I pay upfront but owe you money. Still, I get that you allow some time after the payment date passed but the only way for me to pay for that is to pay for another month? After which I'm signed on as a subscription.

I tried to take advantage of the 3 months for $1 but your system literally railroaded me into signing back on full price. I thought maybe they would just take the lapsed month and then apply the discount. Nope.

Can anyone tell me how to cancel the subscription to game pass on your xbox? Honestly, try to find it. Compare how easy it is to subscribe to game pass and how hard it is to cancel and tell me that isn't shady business practice.

I get that all of this has probably been justified in fine print, but I can't help but feel like I've been duped. I've been pretty loyal to xbox for a long time now, but this all leaves a really gross taste in my mouth.

Sorry for the complaining but I had to get it off my chest."

xboxone,"So this may seem dumb, but if a follower is inactive (haven’t been in a party with them in a long time, haven’t viewed their profile for a long time, haven’t sent them a message in a long time, etc.) does Xbox automatically remove them as a follower. One of my friends who followed me on xbox no longer follows me after roughly two months. I don’t see any reason why he would unfollow me, so can you tell if there’s such a thing called “inactive” followers on Xbox? If so, does Xbox remove them?"

With the help of my friend u/VladaBender and his 3D printer I've managed to pull this off.

The story is that ever since Halo CE me and my brother never had the chance to play it split-screen because we played the PC version. Also we never managed to complete the game on Legendary. But now, since The MCC was around we managed to find some time during last Christmas (We are both at University) to try and complete the game on Legendary split-screen. After many deaths, frustrations and a lot of laughter we pulled it off and had a blast doing it. Since tomorrow is his birthday i figured I'd make this gift as a symbol of us finally beating the game together on the ""Iconic"" Halo difficulty.

xboxone,At 3am this morning I was playing my Xbox One and there were bad thunderstorms where I'm at right now.  There was a power surge that reset my xbox and completely fried my TV.  So I went and bought an Element ELEFW328 TV this afternoon and had to do the display settings reset for my xbox to show up.  Anytime I try switching the display resolution from 640x480 to 720p the TV says no signal.  I have already switched the display to HDMI instead of the Auto like I have read in previous threads but no luck.  Is there solution to this problem?

xboxone,"I've been playing the updated MCC with my friend for the past week and we were doing Halo 2 on legendary co-op to get all the skulls and terminals, basically everything we could get in one go. So we get like 3 missions in and I could hear his TV faintly over the mic and he was getting achievements left and right and I figured I had already had them. Afterwards I checked and some I did have from when I played it a while ago but I didn't have the terminal ones and I never got credit for the ones we got recently. I decided to go back through the first mission just to see if doing it again would grant me the achievement and I went through the mission getting this terminal but after about 7 attempts I gave up. For whatever reason my Xbox just refuses to recognize me meeting the criteria for these achievements. Actually any achievement for that matter. None for par score or anything that we did. The medals that I got while playing aren't even counting towards my achievement to get 20,000 medals. It's as if earning achievements is disabled or something. 

Has this happened to anyone else and is there a way to fix it?

Just for reference I have tried deleting and re-downloading my profile as well as hard resetting. No dice."
xboxone,"So far, I think we can expect the following arrangement in terms of release schedule. 

&amp;#x200B;

August 2019 (late): Ori sequel (i'd put money on an early 2019 holiday season release date)  \*speculation\*

September 13: BL3. 

September 2019: Destiny Annual Pass 2019

October 2019: Gears of War 5 (Gears 5)

November 15, 2019: Star Wars Jedi 

November 2019: Watch Dogs 3 (or another open world game Ubi game)

November 2019: new Modern Warfare game with MW2 remastered in bundled set

&amp;#x200B;

I think you can expect nothing from Square Enix. I think you can expect nothing from Capcom. I think Xbox will remain pretty quiet in terms of actual new games. At least I hope they do. I mean, they'll announce games at E3 sure but I think we can safely assume Gears will be the big huge game for this year and maybe its sister projects. The only wild card for this year I think is Sony, who could \*potentially\* release TLOU 2. Though, I doubt it. I keep seeing them do mo cap sessions (even as recently as this week). I doubt they're ready to release anything. Of all their games, it seems like the one that's farthest along (that hasn't come out already). Plus their 2018 was super jam-packed (3 exclusives between spidey god of war and detroit) and they've already kind of announced release plans for days gone and concrete genie and vr projects."
xboxone,"So, I've been having an issue for a while now with my One S.  Most Xbox 360 games constantly have pixels flashing constantly across the screen, and the occasional xbone game will have random flashes of green/red/ yellow.  I've tried changing monitors, and Microsoft has never been able to identify an issue.  Is there anyone out there that has experienced this issue and managed to fix it?"
xboxone,"So for the passed few weeks my xbox has been dying in a very weird way, firstly the console started to lag when doing anything. Now I get corrupt game files leading to whatever I'm playing crashing or just not loading at all, it asks me to wipe saved games files everyday (I have multiple times now) and the performance of the console is slowly getting worse! If I restart the console it takes about 10 minutes for it to actually turn off and restart and hard resetting sometimes takes me to the start up error giving me the options to update console, restart, and factory reset. After restarting my console and being taken to that screen 8 times in a row i decided to factory reset the console in the hopes of fixing the issue! It hasn't.   
If anyone has any idea as to what is going on and how to fix it that information would be much appreciated as I cant find anything online and I'd rather not take it in or send it off to get fixed/replaced.  


Thanks."

xboxone,"Hey reddit. This is my first text post so please excuse the horrible formatting and whatever else may be wrong here. This may be common knowledge for many of you but I noticed a quick workaround that will allow you to use a wireless USB headset for the xbox one, so here it is for those of you that don't know. 

Requirements: Windows 10 PC with internet connection and Xbox app.

Step 1: Boot up your console. Once on the home page, open up the Xbox desktop application on your pc. Your account must be linked.

Step 2: On the main page of the desktop app, Microsoft has added the ability to stream content from your Xbox one to your pc. Disconnect your controller and reconnect it to your pc. 

Step 3: Click on ""Stream my Xbox one"", make sure your wireless USB headset is connected to your Xbox one and there you go, you can now speak in chat and hear game audio through your headset. 

It's not exactly IDEAL, you are going to lose some quality in sound, but if you're in a pinch and need a quick fix, i hope this can help some of you!"

xboxone,"I have for a few months been experiencing internet drops on my Xbox One X. I never experienced this kind of internet on my standard Xbox for 4 years. The way it disconnects is that it will disconnect from the internet (entirely, stopping downloads, music and online games) for only a second, but it still is enough to kick you out of whatever you were doing.       
         
This happens whether you go wireless, wired, NAT strict, moderate or open, etc. It's a core bug that I have seen many people try to fix over the last few months.      
      
Maybe someone found a fix. In that case, please tell me how. This is driving me nuts. I can't even enjoy a relaxing online game anymore at the risk of randomly disconnecting. And when it starts disconnecting, it will disconnect several times an hour if it wants to.

xboxone,"Hi there!

Few weeks ago i bought Xbox One. It's my first console so i can ask noob questions. The first game i played was AC Rogue Remastered. In Xbox app and on console i don't see played time and progress for countable achievements.

For example, i need to destroy 100 icebergs. Xbox Live shows 0% progress, but i know, that i have already destroyed near 30 icebergs. But if i get 100 icebergs, achievement will unlock (0% --&gt; 100% without intermediate value).

I see this problem only on AC Remastered and Watch Dogs 2. But it's working well for Battlefield 1 and AC Unity.

Anyone have such error? How can i solve it?

xboxone,"I want to leave my Xbox on overnight so something can continue on a game while I'm sleeping, but the controller will eventually cut out so I'll just have five or so hours of paused game.

If I take out the battery pack and plug in a USB cable it won't die from battery, but there's then the issue of inactivity. 

Even if you jam your sticks with a rubber band or something it still detects that you're not doing anything different so still dies. I think it's the same story on GTA Online: even if you keep your character moving around in circles you'll get kicked because nothing else is happening. Albeit takes longer to die than just sitting there because you're doing something, but still doesn't stay on.

From what I can see, there's no way of stopping this unless there's some kind of mechanism that constantly moves the sticks back and forth."

xboxone,"Hi everyone. I was playing with my Xbox One S last night perfectly fine and I when I was done, I decided to move my desk to another part of my room. Once I was done setting everything up, I hooked up my Xbox back to my monitor and nothing showed on the screen. It was just black and my monitor would tell me ""Entering Power save mode"". I tried unplugging the HDMI cable + the power cord and checking the monitor but nothing worked. Keep in mind I have a VGA to HDMI adapter which I've never had a problem with before.

&amp;#x200B;

I then moved my Xbox to the TV in my room. I hooked up an HDMI cable, made sure my TV was on the right HDMI and then it was just black. I tried doing a low-resolution display reset where I hold the power button to my Xbox for 5 seconds to turn it off and then I turn it back on by holding the eject button and power button at the same time. The Xbox turned on and I saw the logo on my screen, but everything was extremely low quality and squished. I was told to go to resolution settings to change this, I did, put the resolution on 720 and then 1080p and my screen just went black again.

&amp;#x200B;

I switched the Video mode to DVI and went to change my resolution and the screen looked fixed and everything looked fine but after 10 seconds the screen would just flicker. I'm not sure why this is going on as I have NEVER dropped my Xbox or anything that would cause this to be a hardware issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so frustrated all last night and today and I just want to get back on gaming with my friends before my weekend ends. I would appreciate some help please!"

If you're standing in the street, there's almost no background sound whatsoever. In my opinion, this hurts the atmosphere of the game because the city itself looks absolutely amazing! The lack of vehicles and cars roaming around the city is also something, they definitely could improve. I know that Crackdown 3 is not about having a lively and atmospheric city but if you had Open Worlds that felt lively in other games, you kind of miss it tho.

Does anyone know if the devs are planning to give their beautiful city a bit more life and atmosphere?

xboxone,"I'm a parent who bought my kids and XBOX one S over the holidays and am having some issues with how I have the security set up to prevent my kids from playing, downloading and buying without permission.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Windows user, and as such, I have a Microsoft account that I use to log into my home PC. I used this account to get the Xbox up and running, as well to set up an account for my son. A few months later and I've become a bit aggravated with the certain aspects of the security and permissions. I most definitely may be doing something wrong, but I'm hoping for some guidance that will improve our Quality of Gaming Life.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I really, really, really am uncomfortable with typing in my Windows password on the Xbox in order to grant my kids permission to play games. I have to rely on them not peeking, which is never a good strategy. On top of that, my Windows password is complicated, so the odds of me typing it in correctly using a controller are much lower than I'd like. I understand the requirement for an adult to enter a password, but why can't it be the XBox numerical key that I use to log in as me?  


2) Why do my kids need a numerical secret key to log in as themselves? They should be able to just select whatever avatar is theirs and just start playing. I guess this is because siblings can be dicks, but my kids are still young and mostly like each other.

&amp;#x200B;

3) I really disliked setting up email accounts for my kids to get XBox accounts. Is there a way to avoid that?

&amp;#x200B;

4) This just happened - one of my kids has a friend over to play together. This friend does not have an xbox profile. I signed into my account to give my kid permission to play, and then went upstairs. 2 mins later my kid says I need to punch in my numerical password so the friend can play. I did that, and then it once again asks me for my Windows password. I entered that incorrectly twice before getting it right.....but now I'm frustrated with the redundancy of all of it. 0 to playing games with friends shouldn't take 10 minutes and 4 passwords/keys entered. Any suggestions?  


Thanks for reading. I know this may come off a bit rant-like, but I'm hoping you all can give me some suggestions to improve things."

xboxone,"Stick drift is a known issue with a lot of controllers. What bugs me is that there is no software solution for this, when it is very likely that one could be created. 


The xbox controller settings app should have a deadzone option. This should be possible on Microsoft's end by wrapping the xbox one controllers inputs around these set values, so it works for every game on xbox without a developer having to do anything. 


Microsoft owns the xbox, the controller, and writes the drivers for xbox controllers. We also know that microsoft is capable of wrapping inputs before a game receives them, since the current app can already remap buttons system-wide. This wouldn't solve ALL stick drift issues, but a vast majority.



Why doesn't this exist? is there a software limitation that I could not think of? Not to put on a tinfoil hat, but is the lack of this setting on purpose to get people to repurchase controllers?

xboxone,'Tomb Raider' Developer Hints More Lara Croft Is Coming
xboxone,Anyone find all 3?  I found the one that was sitting on the chests fairly close to where the hammer puzzle was and the one in the room where you need the chains.  Spent a good 45 minutes looking for the third but no luck.  Google doesn't help either.
xboxone,"Alright guys I’m at a loss here and I was hoping I could get some help before I have to send it in again for third time (first Scorpio bricked 5mon after day 1 purchase and the replacement they sent me had the HDD fail 2wks after receiving it). 

My Scorpio constantly has games crash back to the main menu. The newest tomb raider has been a pain to get through because it would constantly crash during loading, cutscenes, or gameplay. PUBG, rocket league, and kingdom hearts to name a few have also crashed and returned me to home. 

I bought NBA 2k19 today as it was on sale and the game has constantly crashed on startup. When it doesn’t crash on startup it won’t load the menus fully. They either load in completely black with just play game title header at the top, load in with graphics glitched, or they load in and it won’t show any of the tiles to select different game modes. I’ve got it to launch correctly one time, and big surprise the game crashed. 

After a 1hr waste with support they want me to take my Xbox in to a Microsoft store. Closest one is 250mi away, so I’m expected to pay to ship them my now third in the last year broken Scorpio console. 

I’ve done a factory reset on the Xbox as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the problem games. Has anyone else had this issue and managed to remedy it, or am I just screwed on more time and money on this console?"

xboxone,"title bad, not ALL people who use LFG do this, but.. 

I’ve noticed through my years using the LFG feature that lots of users LOVE to put the “mic required” tag in the post. It is understandable with LFG listings such as 
roleplaying
selling virtual items
actual talking/chilling listings

But I see them as well on posts involving 
car shows, 
meetups 
drift/drag/rally sessions in racing games, 

or just big group activities in other games that don’t really rely on communication as much. 

I myself DO have a microphone, and use it, but I do notice that players without mics/headsets tend to be on their best behavior and usually are masters of communication. 

I even went and tried it myself, I usually play about every other day for about 2 1/2 hours or so, so I decided to cut the cord for 2 weeks and see how hard it actually is to find available groups that fit my new handicap. 

I tried a few games such as: Forza Horizon 4, GTA 5, Battlefield 4, Call of Duty, and even Minecraft, where you can literally place signs and communication tends to be easier. 

I could go through each of my experiences with each game, which would take too much time, but what I will say is this:  
•With no way of speaking directly, they have mastered the Xbox keyboard.
•they adapt and have to find ways of communication within game 
•party chat, party chat, party chat.
•For the LFG invite message, I usually have to put in “no mic, but interested” or just don’t include I have no mic and hope they don’t notice. About half the time this works. Which is 25% for each, roughly.
•if they do find out you don’t have a mic, even after being there with them participating in the game avidly for a few minutes, they’ll still kick you.

I’m going to be honest, if you’re a player without a mic for whatever reason, wether it be you can afford it, you’re shy, or lazy; it’s hard. And I can’t imagine how you do it. But for you troopers out there that nod your in game head up and down or side to side every five seconds, props to you for being innovators. 

In conclusion, I hope this sparks some interest in some Xbox users, or even other consoles or PC, to rethink their treatment towards players without mics. 
And for the community of people without mics to arise in the comments. :)"

If money weren’t an issue I’d actually buy a PlayStation just for that game. Not even because it’s so good, but because it’s literally the only baseball game on the market. That just doesn’t make sense to me. (And no, RBI Baseball doesn’t count.)

2K no longer has exclusive rights to the baseball. Their feud with EA is over now. I’ve seen the head of EA in interviews talk about wanting to do it again. MVP Baseball to this day is still the best baseball game ever created. I would be over the moon if they picked this series back up again. The lack of a serious baseball game in the entire lifespan of the Xbox One has been such a slap in the face to Xbox owners who love the game of baseball. 

I just really hope that someone announces one before the next cycle of consoles comes out, otherwise I think a lot more casuals will switch to PlayStation. Microsoft is losing out on so much money by not having one. Whoever creates the next baseball game that’s not console exclusive will outsell The Show, particularly because it won’t be limited to one group of people. Here’s to hoping we get one soon."

xboxone,"With respect to current market cap values, Microsoft (as a company) is valued at 928 billion dollars while Sony is valued at 59.2 billion - literally 15x the size of Sony. So why do I feel like Xbox been the clear ""2nd place"" system for over a decade (that's 10+ years!) when the parent company is one of the greatest tech companies in history and the leading competitor is a fraction of the size?

I've been using the same elite controller since it dropped in 2015, not a single effort has been made to update it or improve on it in any way. The xbox controller itself has not been updated for over 11 years (except for colors, lol). PS has always had a step up on game titles, including exclusivity over pre-launch access, dlc's, and pretty much everything else. Furthermore, when X1X dropped, they promised it would be the most powerful console ever, and although it technically is, PS4 pro dropped an entire year earlier (Ps4 Pro Nov 2016 / X1X Nov 2017) and its not that much weaker - like a mustang vs. a mustang gt or something. It's better by the numbers and on paper, but it's not lights out better the way Neo-Geo was vs. Nintendo Classic back in the day.

I feel like Microsoft has had the means to make Xbox great over the past 10 years, and they simply haven't. The capacity to fund production studios, developers, coders, and whatever else that may have helped gain global marketshare while propelling Xbox atop the gaming sector competition has always been there. But instead, we got Kinect, emojis, and different colors of the same controllers.

Now, Google is entering the space with what could possibly be the beginning of console Armageddon, and Microsoft is proud to introduce us to a Blu-Ray-less, bluetooth-less, SSD-less system that is relatively close in price to the previous system that did have Blu-Ray... and thats supposed to be the next step in forward progression. 

I enjoy gaming, spend good money on hardware and software, but would like to know that the side I am on is at least TRYING to improve the experience vs other platforms. For the past 10+ years, that has not been the case. It's disappointing. My question is... What the fuck?

xboxone,"*Please remember, while these may not be of use to you, many people may not know the below*

**Current Known issues**

* Issues with Youtube video decoding.

Shows as major artifacting / coloured screen freeze. Looks very glitchy. **NO FIX YET**

* Elite controller Grip issues.

This is now a well known issues. There are a few fixes available. Super glue seems to work well, third party replacements are also available. If the controller is in warranty, then sent it back. For the EU there's a standard 2 year warranty, provided by the seller. So see if you can exchange it.

* Lag in games.

First thing, are you on wireless? If so, try a wired solution. If it's too far from your router, powerline adaptors seem to work well. Depending on your router, it might also be worth seeing how busy your wireless channel is. If there's enough interest in this I can provide a lot more details.

* XBOX live status

Currently Green. Easily checked [HERE](https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status)

 * Loud XBOX ONE X

Currently, the only solution to this is to either clean your console, and if that fails, replace your thermal paste. DO NOT attempt this unless your technically competent and feeling brave. This DOES VOID YOUR WARRANTY. The noise does not stop it from working, so unless it's really driving you crazy, I would suggest it's left. If it's still in warranty contact Microsoft support, they may be able to repair or replace it.

** Helpful tips and some commonly asked questions **

* Game Sharing

This is not an official feature, so you will likely not getting any official support. However you and a friend can share games. Instructions can be found [HERE](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gameshare-xbox-one/)

* Game Pass

Game pass allows you access to a large catalogue of games for a monthly fee. These games download to your console, they do not stream. The games available are updated regularly, games are removed and new games added. You are also provided a 20% on games in the catalogue, so they are available if they're removed. All new Microsoft Published games are available on game pass from release date.

* Games with gold.

Every month 3-4 games are available for free on games with gold. You keep these games permanently and are not removed. They are full downloads. 


*If anyone else has further information or useful stuff to add, please comment and I'll add it in as soon as I can*"

I have the One X Scorpio and LG oled E8 which supports dolby atmos and HyperX cloud 2 headset. 

I enabled dolby atmos on my xbox. Bit stream Out, dolby atmos for home theater. And now i have the dolby atmos sign popping up on my tv when xbox is on.

Now I also want that my headset dolby atmos. So i changed my headset settings to Dolby atmos for Headphones.

TV works, but now I can't get sound of my headset. I use the chatpad so I tried connecting it directly to my controller with no success. When I try to change my headset settings I get an error : check your audio receiver.

It worked when I hadn't enabled dolby atmos for home theater...

Is it because of my headset? Or did I do something wrong by enabling Dolby or forget some settings? 

TIA"

I want to to thank Microsoft for actually dealing with a case like this as I know a lot of time must have went into getting sufficient proof.

I recently got my first Xbox One, in fact, it's the first console I've ever owned in my life and I'm trying to get the hang of it, but that's not why I'm here friends.

I know there's a lot of people out there who don't like the game and call it the ""Walking simulator"" so if you're one of those people and have an unused DayZ redeem code for Xbox one I would appreciate getting your offer, perhaps you would be willing to sell it to me for cheap?

When using streaming apps, things are all fine and good. When playing Halo 5 or MCC, things work absolutely perfectly too. However, while playing Forza Horizon 4 or Destiny 2, things get weird. 

In D2, I can load the game and select my character. But when I try to load an activity I get hit with several ""contacting servers"" messages, usually followed by an error code and a kick to orbit. Meanwhile, Forza will keep disconnecting from online services.

When the disconnects happen they are usually joined by my Xbox Live party disconnecting. This only happens in the affected games, it works fine during the non-affected ones.

Like I said, it's a weird problem. Streaming services and some games are fine, other games are unplayable online. Annoyingly, I am only one Destiny 2 Competitive win away from Recluse and Luna's Howl...

Any game I play these days I get completely shut down and absolutely obliterated.

I can’t play the most popular games (Fortnite, for e.g.) as I’m awful at it, and because of this it’s pushed me away from my friends, and they no longer spend as much time with me as we used to.

I got completely destroyed by my friend today when he was playing my main from Overwatch and so was I.  I’ve very rarely ever felt so embarrassed and stupid.

I’m just stuck in a massive predicament.  I want to be able to be with people I can enjoy video games with and not have to be alone most of the time, or play with people I don’t even know in real life.  It’s sad.

xboxone,"I love the Horizon series and I wanted to add 3 to my collection for sometime now. However it’s surprisingly $30 used at GameStop ($26 with a pro membership) with Forza Horizon 2 still going for $20.

And before any jokes about GameStop being the worst place ever, it’s actually the cheapest I’ve found it at a store. With Target, Walmart, Best Buy all asking $40 for it. 

Gears of War 4 came out at the same time and you can get it for under $10. 

This got me thinking, is it good or bad that a game keeps its value? The Horizon series has some amazing music. So licensing issues are inevitable, leading to store delistings. Alan Wake was an example of this I believe. 

While I’m happy my copy of Horizon 4 will hold decent value (obviously not full price but still more than your usual used game) it worries me that games will become harder to play, even if collectors do benefit.

I gotta' say, the spring sale has kind of impressed me so far. Despite playing on Xbox for the past 10 years, I've never really went out of my way to make a ton of digital purchases, short of an expansion here and there, but nothing crazy.

So when I saw some games for crazy cheap in the Spring Sale, I decided to give it a go. But what games would I be an absolutely FOOL not to buy right now, while they're cheap?

I ended up splurging on:

Thief: $3.00

Lords of the Fallen: $4.50ish

Battlefront Hoth Bundle (BF1, BF2): $10.00

Titanfall 2: \~$5

And finally, Mad Max: $5

I play For Honor and Sekiro, so I'm used to in-depth melee combat and this felt fine the way it was. It is kinda of a button masher, but it still requires you to think about what you're doing in order to win.

xboxone,"I'm in the market for an elite controller and everywhere I've gone is out; Best Buy, Costco, Walmart, Gamestop, Target...etc. The online websites for the first two are out as well being those would be my preferred places to get one online for ease of return if it comes in damaged like the one I bought on Ebay last week and already returned. I've tried all the walmarts in my area and all the best buys in my region are out. Is it just bad timing on my part or is it more widespread?"
xboxone,"So I decided to get back into fallout 4 after a few years of inactivity but I keep encountering this issue on my game that makes it so that the audio lags behind a few seconds or even shuts off completely.

My game also freezes for about 10 second to 5 minutes before starting right back up. This is usually accompanied by unloaded chunks and I've can't seem to find a solution to this. Just wondering if anyone experienced anything similar and has a fix."
xboxone,"Im thinking of getting a Keyboard and Mouse for my Xbox One X for Fortnite, because I just can't use controllers for aiming.

Like I understand it won't nearly be as good as a PC but is it still somewhat playable and will it be worth it?"

I fire up my console, hop into a quick 2k game and as soon as I press the right trigger I hear a crunch followed by a loose rattling. Sigh.

xboxone,"Like I just started playing a game tonight, so naturally I need to get the settings right. Many games have ""luminance/nits"" and ""paper white"" and I honestly don't know what the fuck I am supposed to truly do. 

Classically in games, you adjust a slider until a logo ""appears/disappears"" for brightness settings. Easy peasy. And with a few of the early HDR games like Gears 4 and Tomb Raider they also had a simple slider. Fucking dope. 

Now there's paper white...luminance...nits. The descriptions are always like ""oh make it look like paper white."" That's super fucking vague to me. I obviously I can tweak the settings to where it looks like shit. But there is a wide range of settings I can adjust where it still looks ""acceptable."" But I am not understanding what is RIGHT.

Is there a general rule of thumb that I can follow? For the dumbasses like me who just don't get it? Because right now it seems I always have some imperfections. Whether it's washed out, or black crush, or just not good. 

Help me git gud.

PS: I know a lot of games implement it shittly. But just in general, looking for tips here to at least get on the right path. Cause I don't know what the fuck I am looking at with some of these settings."

xboxone,Just happened today. He sounds fine in game chat but in the party he sounds like he is going through a tunnel. This is a new issue??
xboxone,"I've just taken the case off my several year old xbox vacumed it out and wiped it down because it had become a roach fest (my area is notoriuos for roaches) and they were making it turn off by itself, its now working perfectly fine besides not being able to use the sensitive power button and disc tray would it be a bad idea to keep the case off and just buy games digitally? Im also planning on buying an xbox one s later this year and giving this xbox to my brother as a hand me down."
xboxone,As the title says my Xbox One D turned on tonight randomly after I had finished playing it. The console was off for maybe 5~ minutes and I heard the startup chime. The controller was also lit up as if the console had been turned on via controller. I do not have instant on turned on nor do I have my Xbox set to install updates when off. The only thing I can think of is the fact that I have a controller charging dock connected but this still shouldn’t be happening. I typically have a towel over the system to prevent dust from accumulating so I am worried that if it turns on either the towel on it it may overheat. Thoughts?
xboxone,"I’m currently using a parents email, which they use for their work, and is like to use my own email so I can have full optimization of the account and not hinder their work. Thanks in advance."
xboxone,"Earlier today I was checking out the Spring sale and was logged into the Xbox.com domain and not the Microsoft Store. When logged into Xbox.com, I was able to see the games that were on sale and I was able to sort them by price. 

At one point I clicked away from the page I was on and when I tried to get back to it, I had been signed out and could not sign back in. I was eventually able to get back to the games listing but could no longer sort them by anything but the title and the release date. I also noticed that my profile picture would randomly switch between the one I currently use and one that I haven't used in almost a year.

Has anyone else experienced this?
Does anyone know of a way I can filter the sale list by price?

Bonus question: Is there a good reason why the 360 games included in the sale can't be added to your cart and have to be purchased separately with individual transactions per item? Because that's stupid."
xboxone,"I hope this is the best place to put this, I feel like it has the strongest community as far as my options go. So hopefully someone has experienced this issue and has some insight! 

I feel like this is an easily rectifiable issue, but ultimately I ended up with this problem where I was both in party chat AND game chat at the same time. I want to know: how do I turn myself off to Game Chat?

I'm a PC gamer, have been most of my life. I've dabbled in Xbox and PlayStation over the years, and ultimately find myself to stick with the Microsoft end of things.. For a number of different reasons. I do currently own an Xbox One, but still refuse to pay for Xbox Live, because all the features of Live, bar things like free games, all come free when using the Xbox App for Windows 10, primarily the social features. That being said, I haven't spent much time really using it, as most of my games are on Steam.

For as long as I can remember, I've always enjoyed the Xbox racer series like PGR and Forza over the likes of PlayStation's Gran Turismo, since we'll before I owned an Xbox. In recent years, Microsoft has started to include cross compatibility Xbox/Windows abilities, into games including recent Forza's.

**HERE'S THE TEA**

I've spent time using Xbox to play Forza Horizon 3, and more recently Motorsport 7 through my PC. Today I was invited by an old friend to a Party Chat, then off we went to play FM7, and discover the cross compatibility-Ness that we had. I know I'm late to the party, but I'm still fairly new to FM7... I've owned it about 4 days, and have 300ish miles raced in the game, needless to say I'll own up to being Newb when it comes to this particular game. We hopped into a lobby, and I spent my time trying to find my way around.

The entire time, I could hear my Party Chat through my USB headset and Game Chat through my TV (via PC). I didn't think much of it, until we got about 7 races in and I asked my friend an arbitrary question about the game and I heard someone else answer. My heart sank. I had just spent the last 45 minutes catching up with an old friend, and for everyone else in the game, I was THAT a***ole spurting random sh*t in a public lobby without knowing my mic was on for them too.

It got to a point where I was getting rammed off the track, and even someone set their volume so I could hear my own echo. At first, I genuinely felt bad. But as this progressed to a point where I understood what was happening, I asked my buddy if it was possible for everyone else in the lobby to mute me. His finite answer was simply ""yes"". I no longer felt bad for the disruption I had caused to this lobby: we're all newbs at one point in time, and we've all got to make mistakes and figure it out.

So here I am trying to solve my poblem! As much as I no longer truly care about everyone else, I still feel bad because I know how annoying ""That Guy"" can be in a lobby. So again, the question is if it is possible, a setting through Microsoft Windows/Xbox App or through the game itself, that will allow me to mute myself to a Game Chat, but still have a conversation with a Party that I am apart of. If you've read this far, thank for allowing me to vent my adventure.

TL;DR: I was that a***ole in a game lobby that didn't know how to shut my mic up. I was also in a Party Chat and I'd like to stay apart of that. Using Xbox App for Win10 and a wireless USB headset that had only my Party Chat coming through the headset, and Game Chat came through PC speakers, but the poor guys in Game Chat could hear me too and I had no idea until way late. Please help me fix this!!"

xboxone,"Just to fill you in; I know that you don't 'own' games on Gamepass. I know you're streaming the game.

Currently noticed that Shadow of the Tomb Raider's season pass is available on Gamepass. Does that mean I have access to all it's new DLC? The Grand Caiman, The Nightmare etc for Gamepass's 3 month current $1 price? If so, is it always available? Or does that end when it decides to? Cause I believe within the 3 months I'd compelte the DLC and enjoy playing them tbh, which is a great investment rather than paying for a Season Pass.
I know the price differences are night and day, it's just one is timed. I also don't plan on re-playing the DLC anytime soon (maybe let the wifey play/watch me?) 

Even though I already own Shadow of the Tomb Raider, should I invest in the Season Pass at $11.99 CAN ish or should I pay for the current $1 3 Month Gamepass Deal and 'own' the DLC for only 3 months?

For the past year or so, every time I plug the headset into the controller (3.5mm jack), it usually has a bunch of static but works, both the audio and microphone. Recently the microphone started to get worse and worse, sometimes buzzing and pissing off my friends in the party. This headset is super old. However, mid fortnite game, the audio stopped working. And now I plug the 3.5mm jack into the controller, I receive very little static, and absolutely 0 audio. 
I plugged my headset into my iPhone and audio was completely fine. 
I plugged iPhone headphones into the controller to see if the audio worked, there was 0 audio at all.

xboxone,"So I got what I thought was a pretty decent deal £230 for a One S Anthem pack, Forza Horizon 4 and The Division 2. I accidentally added Crackdown 3 to my order for another £20 but that's going back.

Unfortunately the Xbox looked a little tatty, but the console, controller and cables we're all still wrapped so i didn't think anything was wrong. Now that I'm ready to get going I realise the 4 download codes (Anthem Legion of Dawn and 3 1 month trials to Gold, Game pass and EA access) are all missing. Given the condition of the box I think someone bought it, took the codes then returned it.

I'm waiting on a phone call back from the retailer, I'm hoping they can give me the codes via email.

Now that I've set up game pass I realise I don't need Forza either, but it was part of the bundle so I won't be able to return it.

Game pass seems like such an awesome service, excited to be part of it. Do people still buy games? ;)"

After logging out to fix an issue, I realized i didn’t remember a password the 13 year old me set. My fault, I know. Since that moment I’ve been sent on a wild goose chase. I’ve filed every recovery form available, so much so they won’t let me anymore. And as I’m sure some of y’all know, there’s nothing else to do. I’ve even been temporarily blocked for attempting my password too much. They have no one with the authority to help with this issue online or over the phone apparently. I’m hoping that I’m wrong, does anyone have any glimmer of hope to share with me?"

So although his account which the game downloads are on the xbox, I can't sign into his account because I don't have the password to them. Which is fine. I then made my new account which is the home XBOX on the xbox, and all of the games still work without asking me to sign into the seller's account?! can someone explain to me why this is working? I assumed the xbox required me to sign into the account which downloaded the game unless that account is the home xbox so all the users on the xbox can play? Is my xbox glitched?!

games that I have which are working: jurassic world evolution, forza motorsport 7, forza horizon 4, ace kombat 7, ride 2, the grand tour, ace kombat 6, mortal kombat x

with sky whenever i try to play GoT it starts up and plays about 2 seconds of the first advert and then stops playing and im back on the select episode screen. i cant watch any live tv either i just get a blank screen. i was watching skysports last night and everything was working as intended.

&amp;#x200B;

with now tv (which i downloaded and got the 7 day free trial specifically because sky wasnt working) it tries to load the episode, spins the buffer symbol for a few seconds then says ""an error has occurred"". Ive tried the now tv app on my laptop but my laptop is not very high spec and it plays but there is a lot of audio and visual freezing making the show unwatchable. 

&amp;#x200B;

its nothing to do with my connection speed as i checked it with an online speed tester and was getting upwards of 80mbs.

I'm having an issue on my Xbox YouTube app, basically I'll be watching a video when the image will 'freeze' and become distorted and turn grey... Or green. Examples attached - https://imgur.com/gallery/3wblwYw. The audio will continue playing in the background though. This happens very frequently, multiple times during a YouTube binge. It'll 'freeze' for about 4 seconds at a time. 

I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and that hasn't helped. I've done some googling, can't seem to find anyone who has the same problem as me, but surely that can't be true?

Has anyone had this issue? If so is there a solution?"

I replied to another post that was of a similar mind as myself and shortly there after they blocked it saying it will cause more trolling because it's negative. Well I'm not gonna post anything positive about having mixer force installed then locked in place on my xbox. Sorry I think it's dumb to pay to watch unknown people play games. I didn't like it when I was a kid watching my friends play  and I certainly don't like it now as a man-child. I mean adult. So not only did they violate me and/or my rights ;p I'm still stuck with mixer. Anyone know anything about how to stop this or just at the very least get mixer off my xbox. Much appreciated:)

I invested in the recon tech model hoping it would be of better quality, but it started having problems in less than six months. I bought a basic controller after that, which broke in two months. Got them both replaced and the new recon tech broke in three months.

My Xbox tears aside, there was something I couldn't find anywhere on the Microsoft sites concerning the lenght of the recon tech warranty. Now in the box it says it is the standard three months, but the customer service informed me that it now has the same one year warranty as the elite controller.

Just throwing this out there incase someone isn't aware of this."

For example Just Cause 3 or Call of Duty WWII, is it possible to play against against each other or cooperatively?

How about  The Division? Or can you please tell me of some games that would allow me to play over xbox one together with my nephew? He's 13 y.o.

leagueoflegends,"Izma is a support champion that focuses on expanding her reign throughout the map. She’s able to provide temporary support across the map with hives, and nurture nearby allies with her unique honey mechanic.

P - Hive Mentality
Izma gains bonus movespeed when moving around or towards hives. When Izma damages enemy champions near hives, they are applied with Honey for 3 seconds. Allies that damage Honeyed champions heal a small amount, up to a cap.

Q - Nectar Shot
Izma spews a nectar in a line, exploding on the first enemy hit, dealing damage and applying Honey to enemy champions. Allies in range are healed.

W - Bee Construct
Izma creates a Hive at the target location. The Hive slowly releases a swarm of bees over 3 seconds. Hives last for 5 minutes and can be destroyed. Bee swarms deal damage over time to enemy champions. Damage is doubled and  persists for 2 seconds upon leaving the swarm if enemy champion is Honeyed.

E - Signal Order

Passive: Empty hives can be filled by Izma for a health cost.

First cast: Izma sends a signal to a specific hive anywhere on the map.

Second cast: Izma commands that hives swarm to either shield an ally, or attack an enemy. Attacking an enemy causes the swarm to follow that champion for 3 seconds. This empties the targeted hive.

R - Queens Sting
Izma flies forward, grappling the first enemy champion for up to 3 seconds. Izma will sting the champion every second she stays attached to them. On recast, Izma will stop stinging and pick up the enemy, flying them both a set distance towards the nearest hive.

Feedback is appreciated!

Other potential themes for this champion:
- A void queen controlling Zerg-like parasites.
- A shuriman who can command scarabs."

I mean like come on I have been playing this game since 2011 on and off and in the last 2 months I got banned for 2 weeks and now permanently. From 2011 to 2018 no ban whatsoever even tho I had the same attitude which I saw many streamers having (even worse)

What do you guys think?"
leagueoflegends,"Let me get this straight, this is not to take away CLG's success in Spring 2016 and their MSI run, but there was something truly magical about that split that I'm wondering if we're going to ever witness this kind of accomplishment ever again.

When Team Liquid won its first LCS title back in Spring 2018, comments on reddit were jokingly claiming that Steve had bought a LCS title. With their third consecutive win just a few days ago, and with arguably a more stacked roster, this joke comment appears to be grounded in the truth. And this is not exclusive to Team Liquid, teams that have won a LCS title were historically stacked in talent at the time, it's also why Team Solo Mid has so many banners in the studio.

The roster that CLG had in 2016 is different though. Given a bit of context, fans still argue that the roster of Zionspartan - Xmithie - Pobelter - Doublelift - Aphromoo was the strongest roster CLG ever had. Following a disastrous run at Worlds, the organization decided to let go their starter midlaner and  star player ADC in favour of two rookies. When it was announced, it was probably regarded as one of the worst roster move ever conceived. Not only because it was a straight downgrade on paper, but because Doubelift would end up on TSM, a roster that was looking to rebuild at the time, and Pobelter would end up on the new feared team Immortals. (and remember that talent gets you titles).

Yet, everything about their run in 2016 went against expectation. In the regular season they finished second, granting them a playoff bye, ranking above C9, TSM and Liquid. They were also the only team to give a lost to Immortals, who were the clear favourites to win everything. 

Then comes the playoff, which was even more unexpected. In a vacuum, it doesn't seem unlikely that CLG could have won it all. After all, they did finish second in the regular season. However, the team had a hard fought battle against Liquid in 5 games and people were largely criticizing the rookies Stixxay and Huhi. On the other side of the bracket, TSM not only destroyed Cloud9 in four games, but swept Immortals who were one of the strongest roster at the time. Basically, TSM made it look easy and they were the team to beat. For CLG, that struggled against an arguably weaker team, TSM came in the finals as the clear favourite. What we got was an exciting 5 games final with one of the most memorable last teamfight in LCS and a CLG victory.

And so a team that no one believed in, that came from one of the ""worst"" roster move in history of the LCS, managed to win another lcs title back to back and reached the finals at MSI (which was considered one of the best international accomplishment in NA until C9's run at Worlds 2018). Since then, the LCS title has been shared by Team Solomid and Team Liquid who are arguably two powerhouse. Even for the games that went to Silverscrape, the opposing team was also another roster stacked with talent. With the influx of money and import in the league, it is rather unlikely that we'll relive the excitement of Spring 2016. But who knows, maybe a team of true underdog will come around one of these days and surprise the hell out of us."

leagueoflegends," 

Summoners of the Rift,

It is with great pride and excitement that I present to you 20orbe20d, the most fearsome team in League of Legends. Iron 4 shidders and mage support mains beware our gamesense and technical prowess. Since the dawn of season 3 we have been grinding in the bottom ranks of the game to forge our skills in the fires of rando all-chat flame. An endless onslaught of feeding Yasuo and Riven mains with fragile egos has galvanized our bonds as e-teammates and enlightened us to the intricacies of not just the multiplayer online battle arena itself, but the community that plays it day in and day out. 

What is our goal as a team? Simply: to reach for the greatest heights in all of League of Legends competitive ranked play: Gold rank or higher in flex queue. Beyond that? Challenjour. We seek opponents of all shapes and sizes to test our 3rd eye macrogame strategies and refined micromechanics. We can say with confidence we will defeat any band of rag-tag challengers from the League of Legends subreddit, regardless of rank. 

And now, a little about ourselves as players. Our team is 6 members strong, consisting of AlwaysInYourBase, NeverInYourBase, Pee Pee Pants, Poo Poo Pants, KingSeanIII, and ggotitans. All of us are seasoned veterans of the game and fearsome solo/duo players in our own right. We play all kinds of roles including top lane, middle lane, jungler, support, adc, fighter, assassin, marksman, mage support, and many more. All of us are versatile and can cover any role or lane assignment, and some of us even own all the champions, so good luck trying to target ban our most played champs; all of us can be passable on almost any champ in the game. 

You may be thinking this is just a joke, but I assure you it is not. This is a serious challenge to all self-proclaimed League of Legends players out there lurking this subreddit instead of playing the game. We want to play against you and beat you into submission. We will bruise your fragile egos and smash them upon the rocks of the rift like brittle glass. We want to invade your jungles and push your towers. We want a shot at the greatest players of all time like Michael Santana and Voyboy. Give us a chance and we will rock your world. Believe it."
leagueoflegends,FLASHBACK | LEC 2019 Spring Finals
leagueoflegends,"So im a begginer so to say, im a lv.31 so im i know about the game but still im bitvthat good that i know everything that i have to do, but holy shit people are rude in this game. If u die 1 time at the beginning = ur feeding, if ur enemy is a perfect counter and u are not able to maintain lane control = ur a noob, if u dont have 150 cs after 10m = ur the reason for losing, if u die because the enemy flanker is on u the whole time = feeding and so on
I'm I going to have to play against bots till I become a pro or what, there is no place for error on this game."
leagueoflegends,"Thoughts? Duoing can be such a huge advantage in ranked that I feel like it's a little unfair to players who prefer to play solo. Yes I'm aware the enemy team gets a slightly higher average MMR if you're duoing but let's be honest most of the time it's not enough to make a difference, especially if it's something like an ADC/Support of Mid/Jg duo who just run over their respective lane.

Something like +3 bonus LP for solo games would add up over time and give an additional incentive to go solo instead of always duoing with someone for easy wins."

leagueoflegends,"good day guys I uhhh need assistance because i am in fact in a major dilemma. so recently, i picked up akali because i noticed that her ban rate critically decreased and now that she's nerfed to the point of being balanced, I don't have to hold myself back from playing a hero whose style n aesthetic I really fuck with. 

but bro i just,,,i SUCK at akali and it makes no sense because her mechanics are so damn simple like on paper everything is extremely straightforward but she is just SO unforgiving I mean her cooldowns are insane, one slip up and suddenly i'm a 3 course buffet for the enemy team and on top of that she's so weirdly difficult to apply in game? I didn't expect her to be this challenging but it takes so much split second thinking to make her work at maximum efficiency so because I: 1) keep getting my holes resized by every enemy mid laner (my kd ratio is literally 1:2 right now like as I write this) and 2) am not proud enough to hesitate from asking for advice n assistance, **can any Akali mains or pros give me some tips so I can stop being a disappointment of a mid laner :/**"

leagueoflegends,I just ready on the news that Russia passed a law which gives the government the power to cut-off the Russian internet from the 'outside' internet. Does this mean this is the end of EUNE transfers? Just curious about how this turns out for Riot and other gaming companies

leagueoflegends,Riot just confirmed the IG-Skins - Faces weren't changed and still look the same on every champion :/
leagueoflegends,"Head of LCS Riot Chopper talks to Travis about ownership change rules within the context of the Clutch/76ers rumors, hints at LCS improvements for summer split"
leagueoflegends,"Don't get me wrong. Sejuani is a good champ and all, but Riot has changed her so much almost every patch like it's necessary to have her perma picked/banned in the jungle, yes or yes. 

Nidalee is a fun champion that could have some buffs or changes or something. She hasn't received any change since **February 2018** *(a small nerf where they reduced her health regen from 6.008 to 6 (???) and a small bugfix earlier this year)*. Maybe Nidalee doesn't need a buff, maybe I am wrong, but there are other junglers (or non-junglers) that could have their time in the spotlight at least for one time... but we'll never know if they only keep changing the same champions."
leagueoflegends,"I don't get it, Zed is not op, he has counter play, you dodge his q you live, you don't you die. Riven can just face roll and still win because conq procs way too fast on her compared to everyone else, she can build dmg and hp and be unkillable, whilst still dealing tons of AOE dmg in team fights, she's a jack of all trades and she fills those roles too well."
leagueoflegends," They could release it ""Live"" at worlds, No build up or teaser just let it show up out of the blue and shock the world. It wouldn't be that hard to do, and could be done rather simplistically by using the champs in game models and tweaking them to do specific things, Kind of like old school RvB. 

  New skins, Something like Rodie Braum, who's sheild becomes a big ass amp(I can't take credit for this, I saw it mentioned monthes ago, but don't remember by who, so, I it was you lmk I'll credit you) Or Pyrotechnics Annie &amp; Brand, Every good band needs their pyro experts, just ask rammnstein,  not to mention that Pentakill skins sell pretty good, I see at least one of em every 10 matches, Especially Yorick.

leagueoflegends,"Was gold 3 0 lp lost 1 game and got instantly demoted.

leagueoflegends,"The patch notes say it's going to remove Ghostwalkers, Mariner's Vengeance, Backtrack, and bans.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly no one really cares about Ghostwalkers since so few people actually got it, but the other 3 were very good improvements to ARAM.

&amp;#x200B;

Backtrack is exactly what some melee champs needed. Even some ranged champs benefited greatly from the short teleport. Please keep this summoner spell... 

&amp;#x200B;

Mariner's Vengeance really did balance out some more unfavorable games. Makes no sense why poke mages who already have an advantage can still take Zhonyas while ADC and Bruisers don't have an equivalent (and you still die at the end of Mariner's anyways).

&amp;#x200B;

Bans were kind of annoying because it somehow made the lobby stage feel much longer, but honestly it is such a good QoL improvement. Playing against a veigar or fiddle just feels terrible and not fun, even if you out play them. No one wants to constantly avoid a large house half the size of the lane (veigar) or be forced to flash everytime they get trapped it in. 

No one likes to play against Fiddle's bouncing crow shit. You can play around it, but it seriously makes ARAM just feel like unfun when he points and clicks and you have to keep running away from your teammates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention you can ban champions you really don't feel like playing. I've never seen anyone happy to play Kled in ARAM. Having to kill minions or attack towers to get Skarl back is such a waste of time and almost impossible if the enemy has the advantage and doens't let you near minions."

leagueoflegends,Its been a while now and one of the most consistent issues with the game is that the client is uniornically more buggy then the game. It feels as if 1 in 10 games it crashes during the load and you just have to hope you can get back into your game before ur ser behind too much.
leagueoflegends,"So I just read the patch notes and came up with that idea, here's what they changed:

### [Bramble Vest](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/items/)

Grievous Wounds duration increased.

&gt;Making Bramble Vest's Grievous Wounds duration consistent with the effect on other items.

GRIEVOUS WOUNDS DURATION 1 second ⇒ 3 seconds     

&amp;#x200B;

[Thornmail](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/items/)

Grievous Wounds duration increased. 

&gt;Making Thornmail's Grievous Wounds duration consistent with the effect on other items.

GRIEVOUS WOUNDS DURATION 1 second ⇒ 3 seconds    

&amp;#x200B;

So, i think it would be better to just increase the Grievous wounds duration on Thornmail, that way, tanks or bruisers can't just buy bramble vest and punish people for auto attacking them, you would need to buy the whole item.

Math:

30 Seconds with 60% CDR, 20% CDR Ultimate Hunter, 3s off from presence of mind.

30 x 0.6 x 0.8 - 3 = 11.4 seconds

Gnar's rage form lasts 15 seconds which means if gnar can get a takedown after ulting (very likely), he has a 3.6 second window to ult again, increased by 3 seconds for every additional takedown.

I looked in the store and it is unavailable for purchase with or without the bundle. I did some poking around and from what I understand the chroma is only available with the use of a Riot partner program code. I don't quite understand how that system works but if anyone has one of these codes I would love to purchase it off of you, it would mean a lot to my friend and I hope I can find someone who has one.

**Methodology**

I'm staring form 2013 because that when major regional titles started and players who played in Season 1 and 2 Worlds will not be count as rookies. 

For now I'm ignoring all other regions and tournament aside from LCS, LEC, LCK, and LPL titles and if someone played other then these four main ones I'm still counting them as a rookie. Also, if a player is signed to a team but does not get play time on stage I'm still counting them as a rookie (must play less then 25% of the games).

I'm effy with the early Chinese and LCK scenes so if there's mistakes or someone I didn't put let me know.

Also I'm only using [one source](https://lol.gamepedia.com/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki) so things might be wrong."
leagueoflegends,"Not sure if it happens to everyone, but happened to me and to my friend, we joined the game about a month ago, and since then we faced a lot of problems with the client, like the ready check sometimes gives you a decline even if you click accept a hundred times, same thing goes for banning or picking champions, you click not once, not ten times, but a hundred times, and still the ban or the pick doesn't happen. Sometimes someone doesn't ban or pick so the game gets cancelled, I get stuck in the picking phase screen, or even if everyone picks and the game starts, I get stuck in the picking screen and can only join the ongoing match by re launching the game.

So im not sure what is wrong with this game ? Is it the client ? Not hating or anything, in fact i'm loving this game, but I've played 5 different mobas, and not a single one gave me this huge amount of issues."

I'd rather wait 10 more minutes then watch 25minutes of the game helplessly play out that was lost in the first two minutes,while the team stubbornly refuses to surrender. Even though the 7 divison difference player is dying every minute.  


What's the purpose of divisions and climbing if I can still get matched with players I climbed over ages ago. Why can't I que up with them but still get them in my games?  


While we're at it fix your goddamned client,it's atrocious. It's typical Riot to hire a team to do something better,then somehow makes it even MORE effed up then it was. I'm so tired of this, it's like you're Bethesda's biggest idol."

leagueoflegends,"Is there anyway we can check the feedback or statistics of what led to the decision of removing bans from the ARAM queue?

* Was it because fewer people were playing the mode?
* Are the ARAM accounts really outnumbering normal accounts?
* Winrates of champions didn't move at all?
* ""ITS NOT REALLY RANDOOOOOOOOOOM!!!"" was the main thought behind the removal of bans?
* Why not try the bans without the event items?"
leagueoflegends,So why is Riot advertising it as being split between Vietnam and Chinese Taipei? Wtf is Chinese Taipei? I cannot find it on a map...

leagueoflegends,"[http://prntscr.com/ncvtq2](http://prntscr.com/ncvtq2)

I can't play with my friend and have some fun just because I have to get master and diamond tier players in the other team. Really? Like seriously is that really hard to make a good matchmaking system? I am silver, I am trash, I want to have fun, I want to go against players that are the same skill level as me. ( draft game btw )"
leagueoflegends,"No seriously. The only feedback I know of was overwhelmingly positive about the changes to ARAM, bans absolutely included. I didn't see Vel'koz in ANY of my 50\~ games because I perma banned him. Why though? Because I play the majority of immobile melees in ARAM and he is anti-fun to me. They always have their pretty little legendary skins with mastery 7, spamming high damage from over 750 units while my whole team is under their god awful 6 dps turret made of plastic wrap.

&amp;#x200B;

**90% of the bans I encountered in ARAM were to backline ability spammers/zone control mages.** I mean, I wonder why? Who gives a rat's dirty butthole if you ""nerfed"" their damage when it's their complete safety that is the most tilting aspect? These vile champions WANT to end early and so what do you do? You make sure they can end earlier. I see you kept Warmogs in the state that it is in while removing backtrack, hah ""how lovely"". I guess since we can't ban the annoying degenerate champions out of our life anymore, we must resort to what we did before, ""gg ezmode over 9000. Next""

""Ezpz.""

""Yawn. Boring.""

""A summoner has disconnected.'

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't see a single person ragequit since the bans were in place. Not. One. Person. It's so shining obvious that 99.9% of the Riot balance team has an ARAM account with nothing but 0 counterplay champions. You guys really outdid yourself. I don't play anything but ARAM, and the changes were making me play SOOO much more. Now? Shit I might as well uninstall if I get banned for toxicity because I talk mad shit towards teams that can win from 750+ units away without a scratch on their turret."

leagueoflegends,"Recent trend has indicated a major deceleration in content output by the Riot for League of Legends. The two points I mainly want to put forward relate to evolution of systemic changes for the game itself and new champions. 

Mid-season of last year Riot wanted to test a new patch cadence by rapidly shipping meta changing changes back-to-back-to-back. This obviously failed and instead of simply just reverting the patching schedule, Riot has taken the extreme approach of focusing all major changes towards the pre-season; thus breaking the trend of having two major break points of evolution (mid and pre-season).

Sticking to Season 8, we saw major focus on reworking older champions (which is much needed) but at the cost of newer champion releases. However IIRC Season 9 was stated to swing the pendulum back to creating new champions. That been said, the time between releases has been taking too long compared to previous Seasons. This has to be a conscious change but does it what does it indicate? Is it that a lot of resources are now focused on newer titles for Riot? Or is it a calculated move to yield balance between reworks/new champion releases."
leagueoflegends,"Support/Jungle mains are naturally mechanically inferior to a person who mains mid/top/adc, you cannot expect a jungle/support main in D2 to be autofilled to a carry role and expect them to play at a D2 level, you just can't. 

At best they're playing at a low plat level, and it's just not fair to the teammates that have to lug that dead weight around.

TLDR: Autofill is fine, but you can't autofill support/jungle mains to carry roles."
leagueoflegends,"Honestly, [this](https://imgur.com/a/5yBRcSB) bug is the most annoying thing in the game right now, not so much bother since this was just for an aram, but much more annoying if ranked!"
leagueoflegends,"&amp;#x200B;

Since few patches and now the notes from 9.8, we can see buffs for tanks, most of these buffs are related to DAMAGE, and I really don't like the idea where a tank can melt one assassin, mage or carry, do you guys like it?

&amp;#x200B;

I Think, a tank needs to tank and provides utility, never kill someone so easy, and riot still buffs sejuani's damage, for example, why ? Please, tell me why? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do the balance team ever thought give low damage on abilities with high bonus damage on monsters (on jungle champs)?

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't understand that, i'm sorry."
leagueoflegends,So with the new change to Coup De Grace from 7% to 8%. Does it make up for removing the AD and AP bonus from takedowns despite it being very unnoticeable for people who didn’t know or didn’t feel the bonuses in game
leagueoflegends,"Hey, there is an item with a really unique effect called Ohmwrecker.

&amp;#x200B;

This item disabled turrets for 3 seconds but the stats are not even close to being worth buying even on the class that Riot wants it to buy. So why not try the same treatment for Ohmwrecker that has been done to GA.

Currently, I don't even see this item as a cliche or situational pick.

My suggestions is giving Ohmwrecker not as much power as GA. Something along the hybrid lines.

15AP 15AD or 20AD or 20AP as single power stat.

All in all I think a tiny amount of hybrid or single power would make it at least a cliche pick without it being totally overpowered.

I say PBE because it needs testing of course and tuning, but I just want some play with such unique effects to get some variety into my games.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and much success on the rift."

Everything is so split up it's crazy. Before, it was just go to lolesports.com for everything. Articles, VODs, livestreams, you know.

-
Then they abandoned it to attach all the articles to the Nexus subdomain of leagueoflegends.com. It feels out of the ordinary. Like Riot was limited by how Nexus is supposed to look. Lolesports' visual style just does not fit the style of Nexus.

-
And for teams, it gets even worse.

Before, on pre-2019 Lolesports, you could click on a team to see everything about them and their players. Now, in 2019 Lolesports/Nexus, I can't click on them in Lolesports anymore. I have to go over to Nexus in order to look at that kind of stuff. And adding to that, it is terribly obvious that the [team info pages](https://i.imgur.com/ClGNKKT.png) are made of a news article CSS. Take example [this part of the article.](https://i.imgur.com/IPqQs9v.png) It's structured like this.

- Article category (""LCS Teams"")

- Article title (""100 Thieves""

- Blurb (""Official LCS team page for 100 Thieves"")

- Author[s] (""By Lolesports Staff"")

- Time of publication (""2 months ago"")

Basically the same thing with this [Ask Riot article](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/03/ask-riot-loading-screen-chat/), except stylized slightly differently.

-
Some other things that should be noted, but I don't think it deserves more than a mention.

- Going to lolesports.com will redirect you to Nexus.leagueoflegends.

- You cannot return to Leagueoflegends.com from clicking on the LoL insignia on Watch.Lolesports. You need to go to Nexus.Leagueoflegends and then go there. Not saying that the root webpage is worth anything because of how outdated it is, but it should still be accessible.

- You cannot access Nexus.leagueoflegends while watching the embedded livestream on Watch.lolesports. The news button is nonexistent on that webpage.

- [The livestream webpage has a different website icon from the rest of Watch.lolesports.](https://i.imgur.com/IzBifCN.png) The third tab's website icon is Leagueoflegends.com. Not sure why it's still the old insignia.

&gt; 
&gt; Rakan can no longer use his W or his E during his ultimate.
&gt; 
&gt; Every champion hit by his R gives him MS (from 1)

While I am not a support main and don't play Rakan, this to me looks like a massive nerf.

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team)."
leagueoflegends,"I know LPL finals aren't done yet but lets start anyway. Let's keep LMS and wildcard regions out of the conversation FOR NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

This my opinion I am no analyst, I just wrote with I saw.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First lets talk about two teams that went 3-0 in the finals.

&amp;#x200B;

***SK Telecom T1*** and ***G2 Esports***

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***SK Telecom T1*** vs ***Griffin (3-0)***

First lets talk about SKT T1. They faced Griffin in the finals. This was so hyped up by everyone after the last BO3 between them. Before champ select LS and Papa was talking about Sona Taric, Nautilus mid, Evelynn jungle and so on. It was Griffin so of course there was something spicy going to happen.

* SKT didn't ban Sylas the whole series. LCS finals, LEC finals, Sylas was banned from red side each and every game.
* Griffin picked Taliyah Pantheon bot lane in game 1 and 3 before SKT pick their adc. SKT picked Ezreal Barum as an answer.
* SKT played stranded comp, 5v5 team comp all 3 games. SKT withstood the cheese and stranded comp from Griffin.
* Teddy only died 1 time the whole series.
* Faker, Khan and Clid was better than their counterparts and Mata didn't int.

Griffin was dubbed the ""Best team in the world"" by many analysts, coaches and casters. They were the team to beat. Maybe it was draft, maybe it was Griffin nerves or they just choked. But they still 3-0 Griffin that should mean something? right?

Overall I think SKT are the favorites coming in to playoffs. You can argue that Korea as a region is not strong, but remember this is still SKT. Everytime SKT made it to MSI they were in the finals.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  ***G2 Esports*** vs  ***Origen*** ***(3-0)***

This was the rematch after G2 beat  Origen 3-0 in the winners round. Origen took down Fantic in a pretty much one sided 3-1. All in all this series was hyped because its was Origen second chance at G2 and pretty much everyone thought this was going be close, at least competitive. Casters were talking about Sona Taric, Kayle and Ryze, With Perks, caps and Wonder able to flex everything things were sure to get interesting.

* Wunder was just mechanical better than his counterpart.
* G2 didn't play stranded bot lane the whole series ( G1- Sona Taric G2- funnel mid G3 - ap Neeko)
* G2 played Sona Taric in the first game and won with it. Origen was allowed to pick Sona Taric and G2 answered with a funnel comp which destroyed sona tric.
* Perks only died 1 time the whole series with 20 kills.
* G2's all 5 players individually better than Origen's 5.

Game one was close, game 2 Origen was caught in G2 trap and lost very hard, game 3 G2 was not playing against Pro players or players at all.

Origen was out classed and G2 are stylistically the worst match for Origen. Much like SKT vs Griffin there was not enough competition to judge the winner.

I think G2 comes in as 3rd best team. I know many of you will disagree with me. You guys will see why when I talk about players to watch.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is LCS wich was a close series with TL reverse sweeping TSM.

3. ***Team Liquid*** vs ***Team Solo Mid (3-2)***

This was the most hyped LCS finals of all time. Even though TL was the best team at group stage, most people thought that TSM was going to win this. This was expected to be very competitive and a close series.

* In games 1,2 and 5 BrokenBlade was dominating the lane against Impact.
* TL's bot lane duo was better than TSM bot lane.
* Jensen matched up to Bjergsen and didn't let him snowball or roam a lot.
* They played stranded team fighting comp, they lost against the Sona Taric.

Many are saying Impact is the biggest weakness in the team, but I strongly disagree. I think impact played very well, he pick for the team not for lane, he absorb pressure letting Doublelift go nuts in lane.

I think Tl is the 4th best team. I think most of you guys will agree with this.

&amp;#x200B;

LPL still is not done with their finals yet, but I **think** Invictus Gaming is going to win. They would come in as the 2nd best team.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I ranked each player in each role. You guys can disagree and I am happy to reason for others wise but please don't flame me.

leagueoflegends,"This isn't a hate post, I'm expressing my thoughts.

League is an old game. It's been out for 10 years I reckon. We've seen lots of changes over the years, and however questionable some of them were, it has shaped the game into what it is today.
 
However, not everything has changed entirely and some things aged better than others. What this has lead to, is a game that has traces of a set design philosophy that was changed around by 180° and is what it is today.

League took its inspiration from Dota (pls don't fight me on this) and its evident when looking back at the earlier champions and items. League was at heart a game about strategy, outplaying your opponents both with mechanical skill, but also game knowledge and strategy. 

I won't argue wether this was better or ""more fun"" since it's in the past now. What the game is today however, while still keen on knowledge and macro play, relies also heavily on things such as timing, precision of action and reflexes.

It becomes quite clear when you, for instance, compare a champion such as Nasus, with a very simplistic kit with hard cc attached to a single button press, a champion made for scaling simply because of 1 spell to someone such as Camille. She relies on timing for her damage to spike, precision of skill shots, insane dives, utilizing the brief moment of invincibility on her R and other finnesses. 

While, again this can be debated wether it's better or not, the state is that the game has 2 clashing design philosophies. One that provokes reaction times and reflexes and in hindsight gives you everything you need as long as you play good enough, and another that is simplistic and offers a lot with minimal effort, but relies much more on your game knowledge and strategy to succeed. 

This can be seen in the items too. Stuff like energized items, Spear of Shojin, Ohmwrecker (yes it still excists), Hextech items and on the other hand more general items such as IE, Rabadons etc. The item design, following the footsteps of the champion one, sees a mix of the raw power of stats versus something seemingly more niche, but maybe just as effective.

This all leads to League being a very dividing game to play right now. A Nasus cripple destroys Kai'Sa, a champion with 3 times the abilities than Nasus (unless she uses qss ofc), however this has to exist, otherwise Kai'Sa would just stomp him without a second thought. Older champions rely on huge numbers to pull their simplistic kits to relevancy in this age of overstuffed champions. And it leads me to question the direction further on. Will the old designs that are semi healthy for the game stay, or will the developers take a risk in developing the game completely around their current design choices. Simplicity ought to exist, yes, but then again, why pick Annie, when you can take Neeko who has so much more to offer then Annie. I hope Riot takes a brave step forward and nudges the game in one single direction, instead of them not being able to determine what they would do for the future of the game."

leagueoflegends,"Hey - I made this post before, but apparently It got removed because a mod thought I was directing only to Riot, even though I specifically said ""I want to hear y'alls opinion, and if a Rioter happens to read this , tell me if it is possible""

Well, let me precise it even more this time

**I want to hear the opinion of the League of Legend's Player community alongside with any Rioter that may stumble on this post, I want to know if others agree with me on thinking that this gamemode is a good idea, and want to discuss how it would affect League of Legend overall.**

Apart from that, let's begin

# 1v1 Gamemode (I don't have a name for it)

**Map :** Something like Butcher's Bridge : 

* 3 Total Towers : Inhib Tower, Inhib, Two Nexus Towers.
* Respawn timers are 10 to 30% (Levels 1 to 18) Shorter than Summoner's Rift's Respawn Timers
* The Lane is a bit thinner
* There is two openings on the lane in the middle, one on the right and one on the left (Kind of like Twisted Treeline's Vilemaw lane opening, leading to it) But instead of a Vilemaw, the right side one has a Red, and the left side one has a Blue
* After 15 Minutes, the left side opening crumbles, and the right side opening gains size, and instead of a Red, the monster in it becomes a Rift Herald.

**Basic Rules :**

* It is a Ranked only gamemode
* There is no MMR, you are matched against people of your rank  (if possible, of your exact rank, ex: Gold 2) and you win +25 LP per win and lose - 25 LP per loss.
* If on a Win-Streak of 3 games, your next wins grant you +30 LP, if on winstreak of 10 Games, it grants you +45 LP, if on winstreak of 30 + Games, it grants you +50 LP.
* If on a loss-streak of 5 games, your next loss loses you -30 LP, if on a loss streak of 10 games, your next loss loses you -45 LP, if on a loss streak of 30 + Games, your next loss loses you -75 LP

**In-Game Rules :**

* You can recall only twice per death.
* When recalled, instantly heal +80% of your maximum HP and 100% of your mana, reduced to 50% of your max HP on the next recall, as well as 80% of your Mana.
* Walking to base does not regenerate you nor Mana or HP
* Walking to base permits you to buy items
* Game ends when Nexus blows.
* Game ends if one is to pass either 300 CS, or 12 Kills.

**Ranks :** As usual

Bring back smite buffs for each camp with some more interesting interactions and move the oracle buff to rift scuttler or something."
leagueoflegends,"I am not someone to complain about elo hell, I never have complained about elo hell or say my teammates hold me back. I main crit based adcs, finished platinum in season 7 (starting playing off role because crit based adcs were easy and the game got boring doing the same thing over and over), gold in season 8 (never could get past the adc changes back then), and this season I am struggling in gold elo. 

My mechanics have not changed, my csing has not changed, my map awareness has not changed, my game knowledge has not changed either, if anything all of these have gotten better over time.

I'm not blaming my games on my teammates but something has got to be really wrong when every game and I mean every game the two solo lanes and junglers seem to be ""hard inting"". I don't think they're hard inting at all, I think the matchmaking is the issue and they're simply not supposed to be laning against someone that much better than them. It doesn't matter how well I play the early game if every game there is assassins up multiple levels on my mid laners or tanks/duelists pushing the inhibitor tower 15 minutes into the game. I like the fast paced idea of the game as opposed to before a few seasons ago when games went 40 minutes on average but it is not fair that top, jungle, and mid snowball as hard as they do and can end a game within 15-25 minutes.

I am not saying I deserve diamond or even platinum but holy fuck riot what has your matchmaking become"

He/she was heavily argueing that being good at league, and good at anything in general, was nothing about how you compared to others in straight numbers. Being d4 was not good because you are not masters and the amount of skill and gameknowledge required to go from diamond to master+ is very large, which i agreed with. However, i feel like being the top 5% or even top 20% is good. If i were to tell my other non-league playing friends how he could perform, i would definitely have said that he performs well, comparetively.  Please comment what you think. Id love to have a discussion about this

leagueoflegends,I know it's a meme game mode but man it's so frustrating to go in to try and have a chill time and play against ARAM-only accounts. I wish there was some sort of explanation as to why they took bans out.
leagueoflegends,"[Zoe Bug] Her bubble didn't pop while I was taking damage, making it a 2.25 second stun"
leagueoflegends,"I've always thought this ability was one of the best teamfighting/zoning/lockdown tools in the game. It's especially good in ARAM, where you have very few options for engage (you either dive or slowly push forward, making Veigar's cage a higher asset than SR where you have options to flank or use vision to your advantage. 

Now that we're losing bans and we'll have to suffer through this champ once again, I'd like to propose some changes that will introduce some counterplay in order of ""reasonableness"":

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make it a broken circle instead. This gives SOME counterplay outside of flashing, or dancing around in the cage getting creep-blocked and eventually hit by AoE. Make it have one exit. You could even make it so that Veigar could determine the direction of the escape (with a cast helper similar to Taliyah's W). This is on theme for Veigar, who is a parody of a perfectly evil character; it'd make sense that his cage is flawed. Could even be interesting if the cage changes shape with each cast.
2. Keep the mechanics the similar, but make it his ult (seriously). Gated behind a longer cooldown, you could lean into its frustrating components. Maybe have it start off as a larger circle that slowly shrinks, corralling (and annoying) the enemy team in the process. Move his current R to his E, decrease the base damage significantly, increase its ratios, and maybe even make it work on epic monsters. 
3.  Keep the mechanics the same, make anyone inside the cage take bonus damage from Veigar's abilities but reduced damage from everyone else's. What I mean is, lean into the idea that Veigar wants to be the big bad and execute his enemies himself. Right now, he's acting like a CC-support unit in ARAM, locking down enemies, or zoning them for the sake of his team, which seems antithesis to his fantasy. The extreme version of this would be not letting any allies go into the cage at all (maybe even displacing them outside of it after the cast animation similar to Xin ult) and not letting anyone do damage besides Veigar, but that might be going too far. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we have a Ziggs/Zyra bot who fed beyond repair,

then our pantheon feeds aswell and is worthless.

Why the FUCK is this allowed?

&amp;#x200B;

This is like my 10th post on this sub showcasing a game like this, this ALWAYS happens EVERY SINGLE solo Duo game i have played. in 1 way or another.

Im literally on the verge of being done with this fucking game because theres no incentive to get on and play if every single game theres at least 1 person who feeds beyond control.

&amp;#x200B;

And ive noticed that no matter what i do or how i play i cant avoid getting shitty people like this on my team CONSISTENTLY.

it makes this game unfun to play.

&amp;#x200B;

So let me get this straight, I was 10-1 up until the point of where it was teamfight phase, and my duo was 12-2; We literally LOST because 3 of our teammates were feeding to the point where if Me or my Duo were not present, the small jungle fights were lost, turrets, objectives, everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Annnnd I we lose, and i lose rank and so does my duo; annnnd we played better than the enemy team, and our teamamtes.

&amp;#x200B;

The best PART IS!

the enemy team had the never to call me trash and say 'gg ez' as if they dont see how it was a 2v5 ??

&amp;#x200B;

Why the fuck is that allowed anyways?

so i have feeders on my team and i have the best score in the game, but i lose and this person gets to say 'gg ez'.

got it.

I'm done with ranked. I might be done with this game honestly, there snot fucking incentive to put in effort or anything of the sort if im CONSTANTLY met with shit like this.

And im pretty freaking sure that there has been MANY people who have quit this game for similar reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

RIOT does NOTHING (0) about feeders, they do nothing to soften the blow of losing a game where you didn't do ANYTHING that led to the loss, they do nothing about how people can just blatantly be toxic about a fucking game where the the other team has feeders.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep focusing on Esports Riot.. actually nvm I don't care.

Im patiently waiting for the day This game Dies, however long into the future that may be, to the point of where the servers close and everyone loses their accounts.

In my mind, I imagine you should have one champ to always pick if you're first pick,a safe pick like Ahri or Zed that don't have too many counters (unless your teammates are mostly hovering champs that would suggest a more synergistic choice). And then preferably each of the other champs in the pool would be counter picks to your other champs or counter picks to eachother's worst counters.

I'm low ELO, people say champion choice doesn't matter, but when I'm up against Zed in lane, picking a slow, non-roaming type champ like Anivia (her early game anyway) would probably end up fucking me because Zed would roam and pick up 2-3 kills before lvl 6 like, he always does, and any work you do in lane is wasted. I want to avoid situations where the enemy mid can counter whatever I've got through superior roams, or be able to out roam said roamer, or keep him in lane. I notice a significant impact based on who I choose each game. Anyway, what would you choose?"

leagueoflegends,Awell fun whilst it lasted
leagueoflegends,"  

Hello people of reddit. Been a lurker for some time and just wanted to share my experience as a HotS Refugee.

Some background to give context. I player heroes of the storm as basically my only game for over 2 years. I went from Bronze to Diamond in that game and could have climbed to masters if I hadn’t quit after Activision killed the pro scene. 

I played league when Nami was released, probably like 10 games but I don’t remember most of it. I decided to play League on February. My friends helped me along and as I got lvl 30 I went to ranked. 

Here is my experience so far:

* **Toxicity** (everyone’s favorite topic): 

This is known to be a meme on the gaming community that League players are super toxic. But I was really impress in two ways. First not every game is toxic, most games are people calling each other’s mistakes but that’s about it. Which also happened in heroes, most people don’t understand why they are losing so they blame others. Also the fact that the chatbox is not in the middle of your screen by default really helps ignore some of the comments.   

Now I was surprised by other kind of toxicity. In 3 games now people have actively stopped playing just because they are not the ones carrying. I am not talking about losing or getting camped by the jungler. I am talking 3 midlaners (I’m sure is just coincidence) who were even in lane while the other lanes where stomping and didn’t want to play anymore. They didn’t even quit the game, they just stood there at base typing. I have never seen this attitude before, I can understand the “1v9” attitude of ranked, but this people really took it too far. In heroes (maybe because of the nature of the game) people might flame but never stopped playing like that, at least not in my 4k + games. 

* **Knowing how to win:**

This is a problem in heroes but mostly only on Quick Match. Even thn because of Objectives most people in heroes know their way around the map. Like there is an announcer and timer for the next objective and in some maps that is the only way to win. Now in League there is no clear way to win other than “Kill the enemy players”. You really have to consume content, like pro play and youtube, some streamers as well to learn how to win games. With my background of heroes where you are used to having different win conditions in different maps I literally studied concepts that are not taught in game, like priority, vision control or what side of the map to be at any time. Definitely a harder game to get into if you are looking to learn from scratch like I did.

* **Team Compositions:**

I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that team composition don’t matter that much, and most champions don’t counter teammates. In hots a good portion of games is just won at draft based on your team’s draft, also due to the nature of talents instead of items the adaptability once you are in game is a lot less. 

**Content:**

Of course there is so much more content out there, from streamers, to websites that track your stats, to streamers. Is also interesting to see how ranks are more “respected”, like silver players admire gold players and gold admire plat. In heroes if you weren’t Master or Grand Master you were basically trash even to people in bronze. I have also watched a lot my fellow Hots refugees streamers like [BamBam](https://twitch.tv/RealBamBam) and [Turk](https://www.twitch.tv/turk_)

* **My climb:**

With the help of youtube and adapting my Heroes Principles to League I have been able to climb from Bronze 2 to (Currently) Gold 1 as a brand new player to the game. I have gotten stuck a couple of times but trough self-inspection I have fixed some of the issues that were holding me back. I am a Nunu OTP that can sometimes play Kayn playing on the LAN server. If (and when) I hit plat 3 I will be officially on a higher rank than any of my friends have ever been in, most of them played 2 seasons ago and just came back (all but one currently under my rank). 

***TL;DR:*** *I come from hots, I have really enjoyed league as a very different and harder to get into game. Toxicity is definitely a problem that I have never experienced at this level anywhere else. I Love the fact that there is so much League related content out there to be consumed. I climbed from Bronze 2 to Gold 1 using a lot of snowballs.*"

leagueoflegends,Just a thought because we always give shade to riot for buffing champs on patches (or recent patches) before releasing a skin for that champ. It could just be dumb luck but I like to think skin releases are premeditated.
leagueoflegends,"Real question, I hate using and playing against it. I think they honestly should've just readded Fervor as I never had an issue with that.

 Dealing with bruises bursting me with True Damage isn't fun to play against. And I've heard people say it's to counter tanks then why not make it do %HP rather than converting potentially insanely high damage Champs (Riven, Darius, etc) into even more high damage that you can't reduce?"
leagueoflegends,Interesting!
leagueoflegends,"So recently I just started playing again and getting back into grinding league. In the past few seasons I typically floated around Diamond 4-Diamond 2 and climbed there pretty quickly with smurfs normally not having much of a challenge until hitting high plat/low diamond.

I started playing again on a fresh account and I was placed in Silver 4 after going 6-2 in placements. Now the question...

Did something change in matchmaking or the ranked system during this new season? I don't know what it fucking is. Games are challenging as fuck, Gold and Platinum players are playing like Silver/Bronze players. A large majority of players in my game are negative winrates consistently. I don't know what it is? The matchmaking system just seems ruined. Ranked is way harder to climb.. Is there anything specific that happened?"

leagueoflegends,"Nice roblox logo guys, idk why would you make such bad decision."
leagueoflegends,"with tanks you either get a FH which gives no HP, a sunfire which gives no mana/cdr, or with tanky AP champs you just get shit like rylais/liandries/RoA/morellos, all which give no resistences/CDR.

bruisers are snowbally+scale and drown in items and they all give CDR.

vs a full AD team what do you build? sunfire+thnrmail+randuins? YOU GET NO CDR AND AD CHAMPS WILL MELT THROUGH YOUR ARMOR WITH THEIR OVERLOADED ITEMIZATION ANYWAY.

i can play irelia/jax and all that shit, go 14-3 but then i might decide to play a tank and OmFg they just feel like a source of gold income with a shit laning phase and fall off lategame."

I'd like to know your thoughts so please join the survey.

leagueoflegends,Hello all. My friends have finally convinced me to start playing LoL. We've played about 10 games together and no matter what I can't seem to win fights against other champions. Does anyone have any good beginning tips or advice?
leagueoflegends,"*tldr at bottom*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of disappointed with riot after seeing the patch notes for 9.8. 

[""After much discussion and weighing your feedback, bans will not be a permanent feature in ARAM""](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-98-notes/) (scroll to bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't play ARAM much, in fact I think I've only played it 7 or 8 times my entire time playing league of legends, but **when riot allowed bans for aram**, that was one of my only times feeling proud of riot for picking fun over money. Though, I don't play aram, I do know of what happens around and in ARAM, which are accounts solely made or bought just for ARAM that ruin the quality of the game. 

For instance, people will create accounts and only unlock/buy poke champs suck as lux, xerath, etc and cause the gamemode to be completely one sided and void of ""all random"" as it's supposed to be. Once bans were implemented, this allowed players to ban out those champs that these players built their account on and leveled the playing field to ensure that though it may not be ""all random"" on the enemy's side, they weren't allowed to secure the top performers in aram every game. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Now with bans removed,** people that are playing aram have to deal with the same aram made accounts. I get that aram accounts bring in some revenue, regardless of how big or small, but when the 4 top comments of the patch notes, which are usually targeted towards balance changes on summoner's rift, are 

&amp;#x200B;

""Removing bans from ARAM and also buffing fiddlesticks....  
And here I thought ARAM could be fun \^\^ "" - Erikku

""i dont agree with removing ARAM bans. "" - Bearrr

""Best part of ARAM was the bans.... "" - Rustÿ 

""i wish aram bans were kept. "" - Monokuma

"" Please bring bans back. It was the best feature of aram I have ever seen since Proving Grounds.  
And when you will put a featured mode again? After removing new changes, aram will be too boring as usual. "" - ShaPaP

&amp;#x200B;

You should probably reconsider where the ""feedback"" you're receiving is coming from. But I get it, riot's a company. They need all the money they can get.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this doesn't affect me since I don't even play aram, but it's pretty obvious, if you just listen to your community, how unwanted this revocation this. I think if riot still wants to make money without the expense of ruining a game mode that's supposed to be just for fun, then make a ranked aram mode that has no bans for the people that play it just to win, but keep normal aram mode with bans for people that just want to have fun. That way, aram only accounts get to taste their own poison against other aram only accounts, but regular accounts that are just casual aram players can have a game mode to kick back and enjoy the organized chaos of ARAM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Me riot me want money OOOO oooo EEE EEEEE!!! Riot removed bans from arams. Many players that play aram are highly against taking away the bans because it just enables the game mode to be abused."
leagueoflegends,"Seriously its great that he has such an open dialogue with the community and in his interviews with Travis, he openly shared some insight into riots problems the venue and the fan fest cancellation, not shying away from answering the questions ownerships and Clutch or 100T drama and doesn't give the typical cop out responses associated to diversity in the work place I'm glad a guy like Rito Chopper is at the head of the league!

leagueoflegends,"I’ve been playing since season 3. I’ve spent thousands of dollars and hours on my account. In November it was permabanned. Soft toxicity here and there followed by the nail in the coffin of me saying “report the troll” when we had someone inting our lanes. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail saying that I didn’t do anything wrong and all my punishments can be arguable. 

I digress, but I have more problems with League of legends and Riot games than I can count. I refused to play another game on my other account as a protest. 2 weeks ago my friend wanted to play a game so I said why not, I’ll play too. 

I’m hooked again and trying to get back to diamond on my smurf. Why is this game addicting? I’d compare it to smoking. Bad but you do it anyway if you’re addicted."

leagueoflegends,"The reason I got restricted:
First game chat log: Riven is op af

The second game is when I solo qued into a flex game and I died to the top twice (one because of the tank) and the three stacks called me bad then kept asking me to join the discord (they asked at least 10 times), and after I said no to them, they started to say “are you sacred? Why are you so scared?” (At least 8 times) And I answered them “why would I be sacred?” Then they started to pinging me whatever I did. And of course I said some bad words, but just imagine anyone who got placed into those games, who wouldn’t be tilted. Riot chosen to ban me and ignore what the other three player did to me. So disappointed of this game now. 
Btw the jg who flamed me the most got 1/7/0 that game, I got 0/5/1 cuz their jg ganked me three times, with 0 help from my jg. What else I could say? I regretted putting in so much time and money into this game now."

leagueoflegends,"As the title says, the ban system promotes one tricking champs. For example, I main yasuo, and because he is almost always banned/picked before me I am forced to always play a diverse cast of champs. But my friend, who plays aurelion sol, is only good at that one champ, because he is never banned or played.

I think that riot should incorporate a random ban system instead of a player based one, in order to diversify everyone's range of champs. Let me know what you think!"
leagueoflegends,"Banshee's Veil, Mercurial Scimitar, Guardian Angel, Zhonya's Hourglass, Maw of Malmortius/Hexdrinker, Edge of Night, and maybe a strange one but I believe BotRK as well.

When I say adaptive I mean run the same calculations as Adaptive Force. I believe the numbers don't need to change. To be absolutely clear, this means something like Banshee's Veil is 75 AP or 45 AD.

The reason why I believe this is to fulfill the defensive niche's that many champions need that these items perform without discrimination. I don't see why an AP champion can't have GA or why an AD champion can't use Zhonyas. I feel it would open up a lot more options for the entire cast of champions. Normally items can't be like this because it makes them difficult to balance but as far as defensive options go I think it will be okay. I add BotRK because I feel like it would open up AP auto attackers more who could use the %health damage and attack speed.

Hextech Gunblade is a Hybrid item *meant* to have both stats. So I don't believe Gunblade or Rageblade for the same reason should have Adaptive Force. That said, Rageblade doesn't fulfill the hybrid fantasy it was meant to on inception because Phantom Hit is explicitly at odds with it."

leagueoflegends,"Preface - I'm a hardstuck gold 3 who plays mainly top and adc, my third role is jungle. 

I don't think it's just me who notices that only 1 jungler has fun. Currently most matches I play or watch end with one jungler doing everything while the other is completely useless. 

""Ganking junglers are the only option pls buff farming junglerz"" This isn't exactly a bad idea. The issue with the jungle from what I can see at this moment is that you need laners that can be ganked (have a winning matchup) in order for you to stay in the xp and gold pace that all laners get to do for free. 

As soon as your bottom lane is no longer winning, your dragon pressure is completely knocked away leading to a huge advantage for the enemy team ALL GAME LONG. Once they have a 2-3 dragon advantage it's essentially gg unless its a bad mix which is RNG based (a bad idea). All you can hope to do is counter with a rift herald which is much too healthy for a jungler who is already behind to clear before the enemy team can finish the drag and put pressure back in the lanes. 

Counter jungling is an absolute joke (and in extention all farming junglers), the rewards for taking your enemy jungler's  camps to punish their camping or non-stop ganking is near negligible even though it is risky. Risk but no reward.

Scuttle is only slightly too strong. I would only tone back its xp and gold a tiny bit as long as the other camps gained xp and gold buffs.

There's still stuff I could say about vision but I don't exactly have the experience to speak for all ranks.

Anyways, let me know what you guys think. I really hope that counterjungling at the very least becomes valuable and that dragons are less so snowballing tools as possible temporary buffs, but I digress."

leagueoflegends,"I am sure this is not as much of a problem at higher elo, but in plat and below rakas, namis, jannas etc do not play aggressive enough.

The biggest sin is they dont auto attack, when the enemy adc or support is going to harass or for a trade on your adc you should be stepping up to auto and use spells as well so they dont get free damage. Obviously this isn't a golden rule, they might be stepping up for a gank, or have a really favorable trade window you need to respect. But most the time my spellthiefs support doesnt take advantage of the free autos and GOLD. 

You should also be relatively in-line with your adc and looking to control the brushes if you can, again this is dependent on game state and match-up, but being behind your adc during the entire lane phase isn't good. When you are more in-line with your adc you can trade together and discourage harassment as well as get control of the lane and wave.

Another thing, this might be bad advice, but if you are sitting on two pots and the enemy adc is low I would suggest taking a less than favorable trade to further lower the enemy adc or support since you can pot up and generate a ton of pressure.

Thoughts from a shitty adc."

Ornn

Living Forge (Passive)

Frozen Fist (Masterwork Item) Armor lowered from 125 to 95


That's right, Riot is implementing a test nerf to a change that hasn't even gone live yet.

leagueoflegends,"After playing this game since Season 4, toiling in the pits of Bronze, suffocating in the enclosures of Silver, and being hardstuck one game away from promos, going win/loss for over 20 games, I finally won a game to put myself into Gold Promos for the first time in my League of Legends career.

&amp;#x200B;

After struggling and losing two games back to back in a horrible fashion, I bounced back by being the meta abuser I am and locking in Rek'Sai. After a decent Game 3 win, pulling through a Game 4 slobberknocker, and utterly annihilating Game 5 in a dominating fashion, I, PlasmacometX, successfully reverse swept my promotional series.

&amp;#x200B;

After years of being so close, peaking last season at Silver 1 68 LP and losing 14 games straight back down to Silver 4, I finally achieved Gold. I always knew Riot had something against me; it seemed oddly suspicious that I would get the AD/ Hybrid Lux Tops running Glacial Augment, or the Dark Harvest Singeds going 0/10 in lane against a Hecarim. But now, I have finally broke past the barrier, beating down the golden gatekeepers, and can now make my journey to Challenger.

&amp;#x200B;

I would just like to take this moment to thank everyone for pushing me forward in these trying times, and helping me realize that no matter how much you int, if you're good enough and have enough money, you'll just win anyways.

leagueoflegends,"A long time ago, Nasus' circle went from a plain dot to doing half its' damage up front and the rest as a dot. It was a radical, unprecedented buff; but it actually worked out super smoothly so not much was made of it. It may be one of the best buffs ever made in LoL. It has given him an interesting choice about what to max first depending on the match up, and Nasus has seen sporadic pro play and remains decent in solo queue. 

So, what other champions could benefit from a buff like this? Some potential candidates (strictly aoe dot speaking) would be: Morgana, Miss Fortune, Fiddlesticks, Gangplank, Garen, Kennen, Rammus, Rumble, Singed, Shaco, Shyvana. 

Some of these would be really OP, but maybe you could nerf other parts of their kits. Some others could be interesting buffs, like maybe Rammus ult. What do you all think?"

There are other data points to consider here as well. For example, the overwhelming answer to the straw poll question ""[Which role in your team is worst to have a player autofilled into?](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/aviu88/poll_which_role_in_your_team_is_worst_to_have_a/)"" was Jungle.

People that don't main Jungle hate being autofilled on that role, Jungle Mains feel that the role is unrewarding, and you're likely to get the most abuse while playing that role. For something that's supposed to be fun (League is a game after all) the Jungle position seems to be the antithesis of this right now.

Sometimes as sup you get 10minutes into the game and get your soul crushed when you look at see that you're in an 0-2 bot lane with a collective 0-15 team that's down 4 towers already. Sometimes your top/mid/jg goes 0-1 in the first 5 minutes and just quits. Sometimes your top/mid is 10-2 and screaming at everyone else every time they die because they're feeding noobs.

And then sometimes you get an evenly matched game, and [this is what happens](https://i.imgur.com/SgUeW2R.jpg) when you can actually do sup things, not just try putting out fires constantly. I know it's a silver game so probably not perfect, but exact numbers were:

* Vision score: 84-55.
* Wards placed: 27-28. (Team wide: 45 - 42)
* Wards destroyed: 13-5
* Control wards purchased: 7-4. (Team wide, Zoe 4 - their team 7)

It was a 32min game, K/D/A 31-23-35. to 23-31-26.

Games like this, while yes not perfect by any means, are what redeem the streaks of 5-10 in a row with people just going off the rails.

I don't really know what the point of this post is, it's not really bragging or intended to be at least, but none of my friends play anymore so I just wanted to share the rare fun game as a sup main, where I get to at least pretend for 30minutes that I'm good at the game and having some super intricate back and forth vision war with the enemy, where I'm contributing in more ways than just respawning and running straight to whoever's about to walk into or pick a fight to save/help them. It's why even after 8 years, playing every position for months at a time, having probably 500k mastery across champs in every role, I always wind up back as sup."

The second kind use third party websites to look for the best runes, very similar to net decking in card games. 

This process is repetitive and exhausting, and requires precious time of your champ select that you could be thinking about team comps and game plan.

Riot could eliminate this process by adding autocomplete feature, where you select a few runes and the rest is automatically selected for what is best for your champ. 

It would not only help veterans like me who don't want to think a lot when playing an unusual champ on ARAM but would also help the new player base not getting used to shitty preset runes."

Second game; Top lane ints, feeds, doesn't engage and goes out of their way to troll me in JG by taking and throwing the red buff before it's completely taken.  


Reported all of the above and I know that my team did too so something will be done about it but the main reason I made this post is regarding a very fundamental flaw in League's ranked system.  


I have lost LP. Those players will be, or already are, punished/banned but I have lost LP that I cannot get back what-so-ever. There is no refund system in place for things like this. You are just expected to report, get a pat on the head and move on. Or you're told 'Do better next game' despite it not being your fault.  


Seriously, why isn't there an option to have your LP refunded when it's unanimously a fact that someone trolled in a ranked game? Why do we still get punished with a longer climb. Better yet, why isn't there a better system in place to notice stuff like this? Why can't we report mid-game and have a system that watches for odd player behavior and puts a cancellation on that game or even, more importantly, just a player kick system with the option to remake?   


Would it get abused? Probably. Would save more games? Definitely. It would allow players in a bad game the option to move on. To play a new game and not have to be punished for the trolling of other players. Why is there not more player agency in place for situations like this at this point in Season 9? Seriously, Riot, come on.  


What are your thoughts on the current state of trolling, player agency in ranked and the options available to deal with it? Do you find it to be fair? Do you think it could be better? Last I saw there was some serious talk about this earlier last year  involving pro players and streamers in the ranked game scene and then nothing after that. What are your thoughts, summoners?"

leagueoflegends,"Dear Riot, Why is Pantheon a champion?

&amp;#x200B;

It brings absolutely no good to the game. Here let me make a pros and cons list on what Pantheon brings to the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons;

&amp;#x200B;

\-He pokes you In lane with spears which has barely a mana cost and CD

\-He pokes you so much that you basically can't touch the minion wave at all

\-He has a Stun

\-He is able to block TURRET shots

\-He crits you when you're low\\

\-His ult has very flexible use

&amp;#x200B;

Pros

\-literally nothing

\-easy elo I guess ( Yes a good Pantheon is basically getting free lp if his team is not complete garbage )

&amp;#x200B;

Riot, my point is that Pantheon is incredibly bad for the game. It makes people not want to play anymore.

He falls off late game yes, however he is extremely unfun to play against during lane and mid game and once a good Pantheon player gets a lead there is no late game because of how broken and unfair and unfun the champion is. Heck most people literally just give up and sit in fountain till they end. I don't blame I used to play top and it is incredibly unfun and ridiculous to play against champion like Pantheon. SO please Riot, promote champion that have counter-play and are fun to play against for example Jax. He is great for the game he has counter-play and there are things to play around. But then you look at a champion like Pantheon. Unfun, Broken, easy, and so much more things about this champion are unfun . So on an ending note Riot, please, PLEASE nerf, rework or remove the champion from the game. The champion itself is toxic and promotes an abuseable champion design which makes the game (Top/Jungle the most) unfun and unfair which results to players like me unwilling to touch the game sometimes. Please take this suggestion to heart and do something about this."

leagueoflegends,"Have you noticed how only sion, cho and ornn have been the only viable tank options toplane in competitive?

Sion and cho - LOTS of free HP makes up for the lack of hp in tank items

Ornn - probably the most utility out of any tank available, and is viable for the same reasons we see nautilus around if hes ever picked as a niche pick. 

You know why Sejuani is the only tank jungler than has been meta really at all? Because of her passive free resists, so she can go straight into a warmogs which is good because none of the other tank items give enough fucking life

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**SOURCE OF ISSUE/EVIDENCE I'M NOT TALKING OUT OF MY ASS:** 

Riot fucking blasted tank items a year or two ago on the same patch where they changed around thornmail and randuins 

Here: https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017

https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-79-notes

Initially tanks were OK because of the ardent meta in late 2017, where they could just go stoneplate + locket + knights vow because team comps wanted a tank toplaner to fill the hole you'd have from having a squishy supports.


ITEMS SORTED BY HP AND LABELED WITH WHAT ROLES NORMALLY BUY THEM:

https://i.imgur.com/FnDvW7w.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/Sj6LHYo.jpg

You may have noticed almost NONE of these items that tanks would normally buy ever usually have ZERO mana attached to them. 


So do you remember those tank changes again in 7.9?

FOR EXAMPLE: https://i.imgur.com/5P2H2oT.png


Here is Nautilus, you may remember him as a meta pick around a year or so ago in 2017. As you can see, a patch before they tank item update he his riptide mana cost got nerfed by 10 mana per level, at this time Nautilus players would use riptide to push the waves up whilst stacking dorans rings. A 10 mana cost increase could make him effectively use 200 extra mana before backing if he was to use his riptide 20 times to push minions/trade. 

Then 3 patches in patch 7.12 (for the worlds patch that year was 7.18)  later there was a dorans ring nerf that made its passive unique so you couldnt stack them. Stacking dorans rings was the ONLY way tanks could sustain their mana in lane while still building a life based tank item like sunfire or visage. 

These dorans ring nerfs forced most tanks into going Righteous + Stoneplate + Abyssal and then locket + knights vow for ardent meta protect the adc comps. This was OK for them at the time because you werent playing against a bruiser that built cleaver or had conqueror AND there were ZERO adcs building BOTRK at the time. 


https://lol.gamepedia.com/2017_Season_World_Championship/Main_Event/Scoreboards

Look at all those fucking kogmaw and twitch picks with zero BOTRKs present, in a meta where there were actually tanks toplane, these tanks were so damn neutered they were better off building fucking support items then entire worlds tournament and adcs for the most part didnt even have to buy LW or BOTRK

POST WORLDS 2017:

As we know the only tanks meta in the last year were Sion, Ornn, Cho, Sejuani jungle and at points skarner was good. 

And I don't count ""tanks"" like olaf because hes fucking paper lategame. 

Urgot was played as a pseudo-tank because he could use the bruiser items that would give shit loads of HP along with having armor shred and getting stoneplate and a few actual tank items. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#How to fix? 

Riot needs to decide if they want tanks to have a lot of life or not. 

Seemingly they have decided on tanks having more resists less life as a philosophy. This would mean they really fucking need to consider toning down the amount of armor shred in the game. Because the need for armor shred IS far less when most tanks have less effective life. 

And if this means nerfing cho/sions free life passives then fucking do it for the sake of other tanks. 


OR, Allow tanks to buy more life items by doing: 

THIS:

Riot can make mana more accessible in tank items so they can buy these life based tank items, because right now they are forced to buy mana/MR or mana/armor items to sustain in lane.
OR :
They could also effectively do this by buffing tank mana costs across the board if that's easier to manage than buffing items because of the risk of other classes abusing item buffs. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tldr: tank items fucking blow donkey dick for what a tank needs in lane comparitively to what they need to not be fucking absolute paper lategame with the the few exception champions (Sion, Cho, Ornn is paper but his utility is good, and sejuani) that are viable because of utility and laning ability (ornn) or because they get free life (cho and sion) or free resistances (sejuani)"

leagueoflegends,C9 Couch (Reapered) Thoughts on TL Impact - LoL Twitch Moments #10
leagueoflegends,[removed]
leagueoflegends,"I just,,,,I don't get it. I woke up today to news of the fact that as of patch 9.8, Yi will be receiving ANOTHER buff in the form of his R, Highlander, allowing him to walk through all minions and monsters, effectively giving him a Ghost at a nonexistent cooldown and I truly do not even have the words to explain the confusion that struck me. 

Yi is right now, without a doubt one of THE most powerful junglers and carries in the game, it is damn near impossible to stop him if he gets his hands on 2-3 items. You can not get away from him, you can not trade with him, actually killing him requires you ganging up on him, fighting him is like having a minigun's barrel jammed down your throat while its firing he just STEAMROLLS everything in his way until, after your entire team dies to him to whittle his hp down, the 5th player manages to get him down at the cost of a quadra kill.

I can not even fathom how the fuck anyone at Riot sat there and said, ""hey guys I know that Yi currently LITERALLY has the highest win rate out of all heroes along with Vayne but like I noticed that he's not getting pentakills fast enough, we should buff him!"" only to have that horrific idea be confirmed by the rest of the team.

leagueoflegends,"So I've played league for years and never really had intended to climb past gold due to rewards and whatnot however this season I figured might as well try. Always wanted to play mid as when playing with friends over the years I was always pushed to top jungle or adc all of which I can prolly push Plat with but I find kinda boring now days. Decided to run mid with off role top and most likely otp viktor. Now I've played a few games and did fairly well except overconfidence murdered me vs a blitz mid and oh god I learned from that. As a mid player I know my weakness mainly is cs'ing so currently my goal is about 100 by 15 minutes. I generally have good lane positioning as being a jungle main for awhile I can kinda keep track where their jungle should be.

leagueoflegends,"It's for yourselves, you want to help your jungler in the early game... DUH?

How does 99% of the laners playerbase have such a low understanding of the game that they don't understand this? Maybe try jungling a few games in normal if your understanding is so atrocious."
leagueoflegends,"I think it would be prudent to embed the ban mechanic into the reroll mechanic. The idea is that rerolls are made global, meaning you can choose what hero is rerolled. 

If thats your own champ nothing changes.
If it's an allied champ they get an opt-in message, like for hero swaps.
If, by chance, you hit the champ of the opposite team it gets rerolled and blocked from being picked back up from the bench.

Obviously, you would have to give a limited timing window for forced rerolls, to allow time to adjust masteries. 

Advantages:
* tactical banning (forced rerolling) depending on own comp
* meaningful tradeoff between getting a better champ for yourself and hindering the opponents
* easier to help teammates reroll
* high satisfaction when you actually hit an enemy champ with your reroll (this needs to be visualized somehow)
* higher chance to get a perma banned champ on your own team
* makes pickphase much more exciting and interactive overall

Disadvantages:
* **really!** tilting when your champ gets taken away
* toxic teammates may spam you with reroll request because they think you have a bad champ
* Will probably take a little to getting used to, especially for players who don't play aram that much

I would hope that the excitement and anticipation that you would get sitting on an ""op- champ"" as you watch the timer tick over the mark that blocks the forced reroll - that feeling of getting away with murder - would be enough to upset the times you get a champ you really wanted ripped from your grasp. Especially when you can laugh at all the forced rerolls that didn't take effect."

leagueoflegends,"Sadly because of the new ARAM changes especially the balancing changes that are bound to the **map** instead of the **mode** ARAM where it belongs to the Howling Abyss is no useable map for 1v1s anymore.

The balancing changes are focused on a 5v5 scenario and not on a 1v1 or 2v2 scenario where for example aoe abilitys are not that overpowered that they deserve any nerf.

Even at All Stars the map was always used for 1v1 and 2v2 tournaments.

leagueoflegends,"Hi guys, recently i ve seen many posts about people talking about tanks, how weak they are, their items are trash etc.

I dont understand why people want a tank meta, and tanks to be stronger than now, having a carry potetial. 

Tanks are made to provide strong cc, peel and utility, while doing little dmg and absorb much relying on their carries to kill. And thats what they do tbh. See sion, tahm, shen, alistar, braum, taric, gnar, ornn etc. They are all tanky and provide cc and peel doing their job.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont understand why people want to play tanks TOP, have dmg, be tanky, and cc heavy and carry. Thats not tank's job. That would have been broken and boring (imo)."

leagueoflegends,"Hear me out people... Riot added autofill only because queue times were longer and there is not much people that want to play support.  
So my view on this is - if i want to wait 15min for queue in order to get 1 of 2 selected roles then i should be able to do that, instead of punishing me with autofilled role that i don't even play! Even if you are autofilled queue times can get pretty long...  


Last time Riot spoke about autofill was over 2 years ago in ""ask riot"". And from that wall of text they put conclusion was ""QUEUE TIME WOULD BE LONGER IF THERE IS NO AUTOFILL"".  


Worst thing that can happen game before promo is to get autofilled, because in 99.99% cases people won't give crap about you getting autofilled.  


What u guys think? Should autofill be optional?"
leagueoflegends,"There's so much hype behind G2 after their dominant playoff run in LEC, however:

1) LEC opposition looked extremely weak and lackluster

2) They have insane amount of talent but lack synergy, shown in most of their games

3) Their botlane struggles immensely, which will be amplified vs top tier bot lanes

  
It's better to not expect much from G2 and let them pleasantly surprise use instead of this massive hype with a big possibility of crashing and burning. Just flexing picks is not gonna work vs IG and SKT."

leagueoflegends,"Back when I started playing league in 2011 I was having a blast.  Learning how to play the game with my friends was a super fun and exciting experience.  Then I got into solo ranked and it became even more intense, but still fun.  Yeah sure there was the random toxic aggressive person telling me to uninstall when I made a mistake, but that was easy to ignore.  Last season I reached high plat, the highest I ever reached and it was an amazing feeling.  I felt like I was getting closer and closer to the level of the professionals that I would watch on LCS and in Korea (but still, let’s be real, nowhere near).  

This season has been hard, I was busy with work and life stuff so I took a long break.  Coming back I was placed in gold and I’ve had a pretty dreadful win rate.  Now I can’t play a single game of ranked without 2+ teammates telling me I bought my account and that I “don’t deserve to be at this skill level”.  Obviously I mute them but it makes me miss the times where I would interact with four strangers as we stumble and then pull off a game winning play.  

It seems like this game has become too serious. Obviously I want to win the game, but I want to have fun doing it, otherwise what’s the point?  Everyone makes mistakes, why call them out on it relentlessly? It’s not gonna make you feel better and it’s not gonna make them play better.  

I’m not looking for a solution, I will play less ranked and when I do, I will mute all and interact with pings.  I still enjoy playing with friends but it happens less and less often as we grow older.  I don’t want to just play normals because I really enjoy the intensity and stakes when playing ranked.

I just would like people to stop taking themselves and the game so seriously and take a step back and reflect on whether or not they make the game fun for the four other people around them.  If you are in platinum or below, you’re not a professional and neither am I so try and have a bit of fun with your teammates and you may end up enjoying yourself a bit more."

The standard base skin would be shown instead for the opposite choice.

To me, I don't play every game solely to win, I played AP Naut, it didn't go that well, but I had fun. Yes I think splitpushing in general is an annoying and backwards stragedy, but I still didn't regret that game or raged at it at all. I even 1v1'd the fed Jinx when I caught her out so hey, we got a proof of concept!  


To the Ezreal tho, if you weren't playing to win and do your best, you weren't having fun and the MOBA genre is not for you. now...I can kinda see where he is coming from. Yes MOBA's are generally for test of skill and learning those. But...then again. League drew me in not just for its universe and the game itself, it was also the ability to just go off meta and do something stupid and fun, even if it ended in defeat.  


Now the last few season I have noticed that league has become and focussed more on the competetive scene and putting champions into one role and saying bad, don't, to anyone who tries to take them elsewhere.  


So, across the entire LoL community, What does 'having fun' mean to you in League?"

2. plants can trigger nidalees w (and prob other traps) without losing hp from it
3. q plants cant attack zac passive, but e plants can

let me just quote riotaugust or whatever his name is ""how isnt this stuff fixed yet, wtf are we doing? if this still isnt fixed, the champ should be disabled"".   


also a 4th ""bug"" just to make it more bugs than i played games with the champ.  


zyras plants have no stats besides ""0.80"" attackspeed. and when ulted, the stats stay this way. even tho the ult makes them attack FASTER!

leagueoflegends,"Since patch 9.8 was live in OCE LP gains and losses have more or less been giving people the opposite.

Pre patch I was gaining *20-22* or so and losing *16-18* or so 

But since the patch 

I’ve won 2 games gaining *13* and *14* and lost one which lost *24*

It’s happening with everyone on OCE and assuming it’s happening on other regions where the patch is live. 

Since Oce has shit all public figures(streamers) compared to like NA this bug has gone unnoticed since we are depending on riot to respond to tickets or whatever. If some popular na streamer was streaming when this bug was live it would be noticed and hotfixed fast as fuck."

leagueoflegends,"I was playing a normal game where I was mid and against Zed. I heard he does physical damage so I went full armor cause I want to be alive. But every time I got to lane he just killed me again and again. Even after having 100+ armor he was oneshotting me. I took a quick look at his items and he got a Duskblade and a Dirk which got rid of my armor. [I ended up dying 15 times that game.](https://i.imgur.com/rf2NzkM.png) What is the point of buying armor if the enemy can just build AD and lethality at the same time? Same goes for magic resistance and penetration.   


**My suggestion is to make lethality items be just that, lethality items. They should** ***not*** **give other damage stats cause then you could actually make the enemy deal less damage when you build resistances.**"

Not entirely displeased, just thought the odds were slim."
leagueoflegends,"Okay let me explain

 A division promo requires you to win 2 out of 3 matches. In other words, win 67% of promo matches.

A tier promo requires you to win 3 out of 5 - win 60% of promo matches.

So isn't it easier to win 60% of matches than 67%?

My solution to this would be making division promos to be 2 wins out of 4 matches. It would seem more logical."
leagueoflegends,"Riot is seemingly pushing the tanks more and more into the meta which, by itself is fine since they heave been left out for quite some time. However in case of G2 it's a different story.

Wunder has a history of rather poor performance on tanks and Jankos also has been more of coin flip jungler during hiw on tank duties.

Moreover G2 macro is based on playing map in multiple different places with some crazy and rapid rotations. They often take objectives because enemy team got a pick on someone. They are also best at performing 1-3-1 strategies and doing sidelanes in general. This allows G2 to beat teams that are focused more on grouping and doing a proper 5 v 5 teamifghts with tanks as frontline. I do not claim that Perkz can't be a hyper carry as a marksman, but I do doubt the team as a whole. I do not think that in an environment without lane flex and carry laners being strong in pro play they can compete with China and Korea.

What do you guys think?"

leagueoflegends,"*TL;DR*

*How it works in general* \- I compare EUM teams based on the level of the teams against they win or lose every playday. Each team has a score similar to a elo. The full explanation is at the end of the post.

*How Starting score works for EUM -* In cooperation with Cloockwork and Megalodontus who write on LoLEsports about the EU Masters teams, I realized the starting PR based on:

1. [Clockwoork](https://twitter.com/Clockwoork) &amp; [Megalodontus](https://twitter.com/Megalodontus) Rank
2. ERL Score: every team got a score based on the rank it finished the regular season compared to how many participants every ERL has
3. Bonus on previous EUM editions final rank.

Feedback or ideas for some new kind of graph or stat are appreciated.

**NEW - Predictions on Day3 matches with percentage**

**Power Ranking after Day2** 

*New - Updated graph with chart ranked from left to right by the current highest score, with an indication next to each team's name showing their movement in the rank.*

*To Note - Some scores sometimes aren't the exact sum of their addends cause of rounding not showed in the graphs.*

Every feedback to improve this power ranking and how it should be shown will be appreciated.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**More info on how it works**

I divided the teams of the EUM into a starting ranking based on:

* I normalized the average score in a range from a minimum of 750 points for the lowest score to a maximum of a 1.000 score for the highest one.
* The ranking is updated on each match.
* The formula is exponential.

This is an analytical power ranking because it expresses the value of the teams through a score. The score changes during the tournament according to the match results between the teams: it is not based on the victories and the defeats itself but on how these come through, like in other traditional sports. This power ranking is based on the level of the teams against **which you win or lose in that week**. Winning against a lower level team scores less than winning against a superior team. Likewise, losing against a lower level team will lose more points than losing against a superior team.

The sum is not zero cause the losing team loses half of the amount of the winning one.

I will also introduce the best team of the week or the roster that will achieve the most points differential compared to the previous week, and the worst: **Best Performing Teams of the Week** and **Worst Performing Teams of the Week**. Last, but not least, the team that it has obtained the best positive score in a single match: **Biggest Score Wins of the Week**. There won’t be the Worst Defeat of the week because it clearly is the team who lost to the Best Win one. I will also add the best Group."

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team)."
leagueoflegends,"The MVP-award is given to one outstanding player each split, in EU and NA this is based on teams, broadcasting crew and 3rd-party media voting for their MVP-candidate. KR has a different system, where after each game one player from the winning team is awarded with 100 MVP-point and at the end the one with the most points gets overall MVP (Deft got scammed btw). But since every time the same discussion arises again, i think is should be clarified what the MVP-award actually stands for. There are 3 different schools of thought:

1. MVP should be the best player in the league, often just the best player on the best team. (this split CoreJJ, Caps, Tarzan)
2. MVP should be the most valuable player for his team, so often the one player who carried a mediocre team higher than they should be. (Crown/Santorin, SELFMADE, Ruler/Kiin)
3. MVP should be a mixture of 1 and 2, it has to be one of the best players who is also very important to his team. (Bjergsen, Cabochard, Deft)

As you can see this split the 1st school of thought ""won"" in the end (except in KR, but their system is weird), but if you take a closer look at the votings, it was actually pretty close in EU and NA. I have no personal preference, but i think it should be clarified what MVP actually should mean so everyone that votes has the same criteria to base his decision on. 

What do you think MVP should mean ? Is a clarification even necessary or is it fine right now?"

leagueoflegends,"Hello fellow redditors.

I don't really play SoloQ anymore for a couple of reasons, so I limit my games to ranked flex, I like it because it offers a more balanced game than normals with a much smaller amount of crazy people like SoloQ has. Also because I can play with two or three friends, something that I do very often.


Last night I decided to play a game by myself, I didn't notice it right away, but I was matched against a 5 man premade, it became a little bit obvious after I got 5-man ganked at 5 minutes, it was not a great experience.


I know what I lot of people have to say, I know some of them are afraid of the toxicity, hell, I know sometimes I would love to tell my botlane how using them as advertisement for condoms would do a great job, but you know, it would also be really good to tell them when Kat is going bot and I don't have priority, or to let them know that I have TP, or that I'm going to ward a specific place.


Look, if you don't wanna talk, fine, if you don't wanna listen, fine. But some people do and playing this game in voice comms with your 4 teammates is a great experience and I wish everyone had the chance to do it."
leagueoflegends,Fiddlesticks R tooltip doesn't account for AP scaling.
leagueoflegends,"Patch 9.8:

&gt;R - GNAR!
COOLDOWN 120/100/80 seconds ⇒ 90/60/30 seconds 

So, Gnar just got his ult strongly buffed in all levels. Some would say that this buff is too big, but you need to remember it's also restrained by his ability to get his Mega Form. For the exact cooldown now, you wouldn't feel the difference between 30s and 40s on it, as the Mega lasts 15s and you get 15s cooldown as Mini before you start gaining fury again. You also still can't ult twice during one Mega duration (some people did math on that one, saying it's possible - however, to achieve it you need to take Cosmic Insight and Ultimate Hunter runes, where these trees aren't exactly the primary choice on Gnar).

Now, the point of this thread. I assume you all know how Sylas ult cooldown works, but I'll remind it anyway:

&gt;On-Target Cooldown: 200% of target's ultimate cooldown 

So, lowering Gnar's ult cooldown works also for Sylas and he can use it more often. ""Hey OP, but that works literally for every ult in the game"" you might say, and you will be right. However, the Gnar's ultimate is allowed to be incredibly strong due to it being so heavily gated, as stated before. Fury management is really hard on him, but Sylas is free from these limitations (oh, the irony). This makes Gnar quite unpickable in you want to win vs Sylas in late game teamfights. I personally lost a few games that way and it was before the change. Now Sylas will be able to use that every 60 seconds, and that's without any CDR.

Me before patch 9.8.: don't pick Gnar when you see Sylas in enemy team.

Me after patch 9.8.: DON'T PICK GNAR WHEN YOU SEE SYLAS IN ENEMY TEAM, FOR LOVE OF GOD!!!

PS. The only other ult that is gated behind something other than simple cooldown/mana is Shyvana, but her ult isn't really game changing. I am also not sure how the cd interaction works on her.

PS2. Sylas first R is a point'n'click ability, not a skillshot. Stop flaming others for ""being hit with it and not sidestepping"". That's ridiculous."

leagueoflegends,"Just read patch notes.

I would like to know where did they get the feedback because it doesn't makes sense to me.

This are my thoughts so far about bans:

Pros
- You can deny annoying champs, avoiding full poke/siege/perma CC teamcomps.
- Balanced teams
- You don't have to wait 15 min to surrender when you literally can't play against annoying comps.

Cons
- You can't play every champ available.

Just to make sure, I'm in favor of ARAM bans."

However, I'm an oldschool player and don't have much nostalgia for 4.20, and was wondering if I could track down some installations from season 2. I'm a professional developer and getting one of the old clients running offline seems like a fun challenge. If I had to pick the ideal patch it would probably be the fizz patch - v1.0.0.128. It seems like as the game is free nobody has been archiving any of this stuff for posterity, but I'd love to be wrong about that.

leagueoflegends," Why doesn't riot let some champions stay the same for soloq , but just disable them from pro play.


I mean , if you're going to nerf a champion into the group to take it out from pro play , why not outright ban him if you consider it too toxic ?

And by doing that , you would also not get shit on by it's fanbase for nerfing it into the ground , even when said champion is already barely playable in soloq (but still stupid strong in pro play because some sort of gimmick or mechanic that makes it stupid strong in organized play - like tk's ability to save a priority target and map mobility , or ryze's ult or whatever).


Seriously...that way , you don't absolutly stomp the champ in the ground for soloq , and you still don't have him so strong that it overshadow anything else in pro play.

Seems the most obvious solution to me."

&gt;""We are committed to delivering a new Fantasy experience that LCS and LEC fans find engaging and fun. Keep an eye on lolesports.com around mid-Spring Split, when we expect to have more news to share about the future of Fantasy.""

Have there been any updates? Fantasy League is a huge part of the watching experience for me, it is something I can do with friends, and a way I can convince people to stay involved in League at all. Losing fantasy this split was sad, but something I accepted as okay since theoretically a newer and better version would be released in time for Summer Split. Now that spring split is over (and there was no mid-Spring Split announcement) I am getting worried that progress has been slower than riot initially thought, and we won't have Fantasy for summer...or maybe Fantasy has been forgotten about entirely or is another Clash story.

leagueoflegends,"Hello,

Goldish jungler, playing mostly assassins (Evelynn, kha'zix, but also warwick and so on...).

My point is I feel that most of the time, people in lanes (every lane) are just too eager to snowball and don't really understand the tempo of the game.

For example, when playing evelynn, every one would agree that she is weak in early lvls. So people would have to know that the enemy jungler will be more active and proactive in the first minutes of the game.

This is at this point where most of the games are decided. And obviously that's the time where they start to spam ""better jungler wins"" even if you are 20 to 30 cs ahead thanks to counter jungling.

I've recently played control tanks in the jungle and ahd quiet good feelings about their efficiency, because you relie less on your lane early feeding.

Does anyone has this feeling? I'd like to have honest laners point of view."

leagueoflegends,"Which character would you use for stats, and what skills will you pick as passive, q, w, e and ultimate from any available character. (I think this was a mode in DoTA back in the days). Would be interesting to see what ""new"" champion's kit people can come up with. Imagine a Lucian with Caitlyn's passive, Teemo's E as his Q, Tristana's Q as his W, Vayne's Q as his E and Vayne's R as his ultimate. Post your new champ in the comment :))"
leagueoflegends,"So way back in patch 8.4, we saw mage item updates with the goal to diversify starting choices:

\&gt; We want to give mages more options, so we're creating new mage items (and reshaping old ones) to provide more unique and focused outputs and let mages adapt their itemization to game states, matchups, and personal style.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this problem arose after initial mage changes, in morrelenomicaon became the be all and end all mana item as athenes had become more of a support item with the other options being archangel staff (which was bought on spammy late game champs like ryze, anivia, veig, cass and karthus) and ROA, built on a select few that didn't NEED! 45% cdr.

Now however, we have a similar problem. The mana items are built to the champion, as before and not to the situation. The rest of the builds are relatively cookie cutter, almost always being rabdon, void, morelo, hourglass and sorc boots. While the niche morello fills now is nice, the innate stats are so good it's almost always a 2nd/3rd item on every AP champ. 

&amp;#x200B;

This shows a bigger issue in that sheer magic pen is valued over flat AP. That there is more damage to be gained through reducing any champs MR, than there is to scaling with the stat they're built around. This is the polar opposite of AD at the moment.

In theory, void staff is reserved for champs who build multiple MR items

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile we have a few items that are almost never seen, or are abused in an unhealthy manner and those are what I'd like to address.

Hextech GLP: Pre change, this item was a branch off {{item:3010}} which fulfilled an alternative niche on champs who would otherwise build roa to keep enemies in range eg morg, asol, cho. After losing its HP and gaining similar stats to the current archangel and ludens echo.

It's become a common pick up almost exclusively in combination with the Glacial Augment rune. Which we've seen produce some rather ""anti-fun"" play patterns on ahri, vel'koz and sion. This I feel is more of a rune issue than an item issue. However this did come at the cost of its previous users who valued the health, wave clear (see change history), wide AOE and stronger slow.

Spellbinder: Upon a swift glimpse of this item, it shocks me that no one buys it, until we see the requirement for using it to its full potential. Few champions can spam that many spells to have it ready for each team fight, generally reserving it for DPS mages. And even with team help, charging it up is relatively slow.

Shurelya's reverie: A niche item generally reserved for supports, but at the same time is almost never purchased. It's stats are varied and it has allot of them, however they're pretty meh as its cost reflects.

Twin shadows: And finally, the other component of the current Glacial Augment build. It offers solid stats for its price as well as a helpful passive.

&amp;#x200B;

As for fixing them

Hextech GLP:  Reverting the current version is illogical imo, as it'd just substitute one problem for another. Instead adding a similar item into the ROA line could work wonders. So we would have 2 items, same AP, same MANA. However one grants 20% CDR and the other grants 300 HP.

To further differentiate them, we could change one to have a wide coned, weaker slow (imo best suited for the CDR one) and the other to have a narrow, shorter ranged but stronger slow ( more optimal for the HP version)

Simple to name, Hextech PLG (plug)

Spellbinder: A simple fix, change the charge system to a flat cooldown. Either way it's a powerup on activation. In addition, it then gets synergy with 2 different runes to reduce cooldown. Due to the amount of power this item grants I'd give it 1-2 ults worth of CD or up the price.

Shurelya's reverie: turning this into a proper support or tank item is the best way to go, instead of a mish mash of everything walloped into the same item. Potentially remove the AP and instead grant more HP. A cost increase could warrant a higher defence value (perhaps switch ruby for belt, then add glacial shroud for the CDR). In addition, change the flat move speed, to a stronger value but towards allied or CC'd enemy champs. 

To change it more towards enchanters or perhaps add a similar item optimized for them, the item could have mana+HP regen, or be a lategame item than when activated, halves the cooldown of all other active items in your inventory and fully refills your warding items.

Twin shadows: Upping the cost a tad with a little more AP would allow this item to compete with void staff, liandries, morello and lich bane.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I couldn't come up with anything for the main mana items, as they do fulfill a niche for their respective builders, however I feel ludens is too well rounded. Perhaps a new athenes? To provide something similar to the old one"

leagueoflegends,"maybe its just me and everyone else I see playing league in my elo (Dia 1+) but the moment you are autofilled and someone dosen't give you their role. you dodge.

If someone else dodges because they are filled instead you cancel your queue and reset it because otherwise you will be filled and forced to dodge

if someone dosen't accept the the queue you reset the queue and extend the time again.

it takes forever to get a game evne when I duo with a support player because of this. the queue times are like 1 minute 30 but dodgeing and reseting extends that to like 20 minutes and all the fucking champ selects you have to sit through.

Even when I queue solo max time is like 3 - 4 minutes

I think riot should do a test where you just choose one role and you always get it for a week or 2 days or something. becuase That would solve a lot of issues. I know low pop severs will have a problem with this so could you at least test it on EUW? or something. sitting in queue knowing I will get my role also will make me feel positive about playing the game since I can actually enjoy it."

So my 4 teammates went 11,6-32,1.

Obviously KDA isn’t everything, but it is an indicator to how these games looked. They didn’t feel like a lot of fun.

leagueoflegends,"As all the aram players already know, Riot tried to implement a ban system in ARAM and removed it with the last patch.


For the past 2/3 years I have been an ARAM only player, because I am not good enough to play SR and too competitive as well so I tend to tilt in normal/ranked game. I used to play ARAM when it was not a legit mode and you had to create a custom game and trust people won't buy GA, mejai or occulist sword (I'm not sure about the last one's name).


Played a shitload of ARAM and, for me the funniest thing is to try builds with random champ. But a year or so after having a legit aram mode, so many people I played with would have only ridiculously good champs and you're left trying to fight a heavy poke team with your mundo, that was some sad times.


Then came the snowball, a lot of people hated it, but in the end, it made the game so much better and more balanced between poke and engage. They nerfed the healing as well, which was again, pretty great. And we had reroll which would sometimes even out if you get the only champ in free rotation you didn't own (looking at you Lulu)


Played that for a time, and it was still pretty frustrating to have some champ so unfun to play against or as. It wasn't a matter of ""oh boy I got Xerath/they got Xerath"", it was a matter of ""why is this champ allowed in ARAM and why do I see him so often in my games"" (you can swap Xerath by a lot of different champ, to each their nemesis).


So I stop playing out of frustration not to be able to try things anymore without being blasted by the same 10 champs, and I uninstalled the game. When Riot announced they were introducing bans, 8 month after I stopped playing, I was extatic since some of my friends are still playing this game and I wanted to try it out with them.


And so I did, and between the new balance, the new summoner, new items and bans, it felt better than it felt in years. To the disapointment of some and the satisfaction of others, they got rid of some of the new stuff, including the bans. 

I instantly uninstall the game, and it's ok, but here is my question Reddit (and Riot if any of you see this). When I went on reddit and saw all the rents about people being disapointed, some were telling their story, and a lot of them felt similar to mine. 


So how many of us went back to ARAM and league itself thanks to the previous patch ? They probably know the number, and as soon as the new patch is coming live, how many of those people left again ?

I know Riot did the math, and if they got rid of bans, they must have their reasons, I am not discussing this here. I'm just curious about the number of people who felt the previous patch was the fresh wind needed to ignite back the passion for Lol and who felt this one like a heavy rain falling on that freshly reignited fire."

leagueoflegends,"With bans being removed from ARAM, people have been complaining a lot about how they wanted to continue banning things like Lux/Ziggs/Xerath. I dont think any of those people realized how impactful the nerfs were to those champs.

not only did most of the champs who dominate ARAM get nerfed individually, but all long range poke damage got nerfed by 15% when it comes from champs who are over 900 units away.

if people want bans so badly, theyd likely have to deal with losing one of the other 2 nerfs (probably the long range damage reduction).

this also doesnt take into account that bans were likely removed because many people play ARAM to get into a quick game faster, and dodges made the time it takes to get into game go up even more than normal bc of the ban timer

tldr: all of the changes werent going to stay, so people will have to settle for losing SOMETHING. If people want bans, you'll probably have to deal with damage nerfs being reverted"
leagueoflegends,"I see people constantly say that there's way too much mana items in the game and how they miss how mana management was a thing in early seasons but nowadays you can mindlessly perma cast spells and not run oom.

Am I the only one that runs oom several times every game? Maybe it's the champs that I play but I don't know why would anyone miss season 1 mana problems. I recall playing Anivia and not being able to use more than 2 combos in the laning phase unless you liked being unable to even cast your R once you get 6.

Nowadays if I play Anivia I have to choose between trying to harrass or burst an enemy or waveclear with R but at least I can do one of those, in the earlier seasons midlaners used to be stuck to autoattacks to not run oom.

And also a lot of the jungle champs had to start blue because starting red was dooming yourself to having to recall on second or third camp (manaless junglers and auto reliant junglers were the only ones that could start red). I clearly remember playing Amumu in s1-s2 and knowing that if my blue was stolen I was literally a walking ward since I ran oom with one camp.

Like, I get people complaining about CDR now (Which I disagree with as I think it's more fun) but being perma oom was pretty annoying back then and it's one of the things that improved the most in my humble opinion, so I'm kinda curious if the ""anti-mana"" comments are a vocal minority or actually what most people like."

You could have the game randomly ban ten champions and leave it at that. But maybe you could have those ten champions put into one or two pools. The two options here would be either five champs for each team or ten champs for the entire game. With five banned for each side, it would be interesting to be able to spend two rerolls to lock a champ to their ban pool or spend two rerolls to use one from your own ban pool before it gets locked by the other team. 

You could also just have a pool of ten champs that anyone can steal or lock with two rerolls. 

It wouldn’t really waste time banning since the game does it and the rest can all take place during the normal champ select."

Like this are the usual games that I lose I played for 8 hours today took breaks inbetween the games but if I would play the next 5 hours I would add 5 more loses for sure. I also try to switch inbetween the accounts but nothing helps . All it takes is just one guy being godawfull and just afk farm and another guy just being toxic tilted and ragequit in middle of the game. The worst part is these players will int too hard before they even try to take a step back and play safe... just take a look and help me figure this out how I can win this games and not lose them...

&amp;#x200B;

So a quick breakdown:

**game 1** : jarvan and irelia dying like level 2, irelia tping top and died again. She left like in 13 min. We won bot jarvan gave 1 kill away to kaisa (he was 10HP from golems and was backing on a ward kaisa sniped him with W) I died in an all in level 2 but after that enemy bot had 0 kills on us we were killing them over and over and mostly enemy jng and mid came to clean us up but that was already after our top left. We let them push throw top the game ended quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**game 2 :** gragas inted in enemy jungle 2 kills, our mid had connection problems and was disconnected after 8 mins or so. but before that they were flaming eachother gragas was just afk farming even tho talon was overextending mid without flash and wasnt punished for that... gragas tilted and was doing nothing at all. We had like 5-0 on bot they didnt even kills us the two kills I think were gragas towerdiving them without us ... after 8 mins reksai and talon were sitting bot . We decided to let them push we had only inhibitor tower mid and they spawned herald

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**game 3:** I got autofilled and felt like we need an heavytank because I was last pick. I knew I would have had a rough early game but even playing into kayn our botlane was 0-6 or 1-5 before 7 min and my mid was pushing the waves into ekkos tower and was always a free kill for kayn even if I tried to be there help him push the wave so he can back with low hp he would over extend and give kills away. The game was decided with a fight over infernal. Our top refused to tp our bard missed everything and we just were to behind we died 4v5 lost dragon they pushed mid with herald because we already had no turrets there

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**game 4 :** in this game our jungle twitch was hardcamping bot. The 3 of us combined were like 7-1 but our mid wasnt warding and was dying to enemy rammus. The same went on toplane. Our mid even didnt take one plate when enemy mid roamed. Enemy mid was 3 times top and 2 times bot we didnt die because we always saw her on a ward in river and on top she secured 3 kills. She always roamed when a wave was crushing her tower but our mid didnt follow or hit plates he always backed for no reason. Between 14 and 19 min the enemy grouped pushed 4 tower overall because our top was on the otherside and our mid was on the second lane where the enemy wasnt pushing both of them were refusing to group and despite jng me and adc having a big lead we werent able to do anything as twitch morgana caitlyn because we would have been engaged on 5v3.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**game 5:** so this was the last game. Our top picked electrocute on mundo and basically said ingame that he doesnt care if we win or lose because he didnt get his main role. Again we went like 6-1 on bot but our mid sadly was getting camped by enemy top and jng because our top was just staying under turret he wasnt pushing or trying to do something he just stood top and lasthited half the wave on top. Our jungle was invading for no reason. He was 0-5 in 7 min was extrem toxic wishing cancer to every1 saying our famillies should die etc etc. The game was still winable because ekko was very good also kalista we took a fight around 16 min on there red but lost because our kayn missed W in red form in crucial moment when I knocked up enemy bot and jng but enemy top tped and our ofc didnt and we died 4 for 0 they had herald pushed mid as 5 our mundo didnt even move so we opened when they were pushing inhibitor.

I would like to know how to avoid this situatuion and carry this bad players. I know someone can go 0-7 and you ff but I have just to many games despite playing on 3 different accounts where I just lose the game no matter what. This are just example from today but if I would go and search the games from 2 days or 3 days ago I would find games like this again. I really dont know what to do more. Many websites and videos suggest when you lose you should rewatch the game and figure out what you could have done differently. I honestly cant figure out what to do when I dont lose the games otherwise as this... I rewatch the games we have 3 champs having a lead or just us having a lead as a botlane. Enemy has also 2 champ having a lead and one matchup is even. But the problem is enemy always groups they want to use their advantage they want to win the game. I just rewatch the game and the only thing I get from it is a feeling that I wasted 20 mins watching 2 players on my team die , int and do it over and over again....

&amp;#x200B;

Would really aprriecate if somebody would help me. Im stuck like this for a year and I cant figure out myself what to do differently. Feel free to dm if you have a longer message :)"

She has been averaging a 52+% wr since the start of season 6, while still being really popular (10%+ pickrate since forever) bar one patch when her wr dropped to a sad sad 50% wr. 

I never understood the buffs on her charm, and she only got a 20s CD nerf on ult which doesn't matter because she gets 40% cdr every game. She is super safe and is really hard to engage, can tf, is an assassin due to the mini-DFG on her E. 

There are more ""flashy"" and annoying champions out there but playing against Ahri is so boring it hurts. She can even have the luxury of her W being one of the worse skills in the game and still be THIS successful. Is she ever going to get anything meanful done to her?

leagueoflegends,"riot's design team is supposed to go through an approval process. Submit the design of the champion, the design waits for approval of the work, and then implement it into the game without a doubt the champion will be healthy for the game. 

Why is rakan not allowed to do this BUT

* yasuo can do [this](https://imgur.com/7IVmOgN) - btw why doesn't wind wall take away his shield? why doesn't the wind wall duration start out low and scale based on how much flow he has? why are vayne and yasuo the only 2-item hyper carries in the game?
* camille has to be gutted because of her E range WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH APPROVAL PROCESS. Why?
* zoe can do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36OdjGdzJas), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tsT-lz6hGU), [this](https://imgur.com/aenHAos), [this](https://imgur.com/rIGqM2c)
* galio single-handedly secures bot lane composition because of how outclassed everyone else is.
* irelia can do [this](https://i.imgur.com/Iivun5o.mp4), [this](https://i.imgur.com/XaizMJ1.mp4), - dog piling isn't fucking counterplay btw. if it EVER takes 4 champions to peel for 1 because of a SINGLE champion's mobility its not counterplay, its dog piling lol.
* lissandra can be the god tier neutralizer but malzahar is still garbage basking in the hot summer day
* pyke can do [this](https://i.imgur.com/0c1syNS.mp4)
* alistar does the [literal exact same engage](https://i.imgur.com/geK35mw.mp4) but he can't dash out. 

So if the engage is the problem then make it so Rakan can't E until the ultimate expires that way its the exact same as alistar (a publicly approved engage)

Nerf the engage instead of creating counterplay a statement said for the last 9 years. holy moly could you imagine another type of morgana niche champion? one that isn't as excessively boring as morgana and not shit with a spell shield in the kit?

Where are the aoe slows? where are the shields? where are the spell shields? regardless of the d5 ardent support carried by team, the issue isn't ardent at that point its how wins are the only factor when it comes to LP gain/loss instead of individual performance, vision score, and win/loss. You can EASILY use damage negated or damage given when it comes to utility supports for them to still have a grading process for how much lp they get.

Clearly the person in charge of approving designs isn't capable of doing his job for the betterment of the game.

___ 

and best of all... WHY IS THERE STILL 1 PERSON ALLOWED TO CONTROL WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE 20 LP. GRADE LP WIN/LOSS ON HOW WELL YOU PERFORM. This tackles trolling head on because you can't fake damage shielded, can't fake damage dealt, can't fake vision score (you get vision score on enemy champs being visible btw), can't fake skill shots landed. 

picture this... 

- you won the game but got carried by your team as you soft inted so gained 15 lp while your mid and jungle popped off they gained 20-25 lp. 

- you lost the game but you were 1v9. you were the most impactful on your team by far. you lost 5 lp while the rest of your team lost 15 and the guy who babyraged hard inted lost 25. 

this would increase the # of opened games to avoid too much of an lp loss while at the same time reducing queue times over all."

leagueoflegends,"Any decent toplaner would say this thing: toplane is the lane that is more affected by jungler pressure, you are melee so you are more far up in the lane if you idk... want to farm, in red side you are really fucked because of the 2 entrances to the lane, most toplaners have cc so they have good gank setup, you have a longer lane so more distance to tower also, all ins take more time than in mid for example so you are really vulnerable when you try to win lane

All of this while being the lane with less map presence... so once your laner has 1/2 kills... you are fucked for the rest of the game, is not like in mid where you can make plays around the map or get a good teamfight in order to get back in the game, also remember that many toplaners once ahead can acctualy 1v2 you and you jungler so unless is a 3 man gank is not going to work.

In toplane is afk farm or throw a coin and get fed one game and feed the other

overall i think toplane sucks, ty :)"

I liked murder bridge, I liked being able to ban the annoying aram champions, I liked the game not being decided by non interaction champions taking over the game.

leagueoflegends,"After playing this game since Season 4, toiling in the pits of Bronze, suffocating in the enclosures of Silver, and being hardstuck one game away from promos, going win/loss for over 20 games, I finally won a game to put myself into Gold Promos for the first time in my League of Legends career.

&amp;#x200B;

After struggling and losing two games back to back in a horrible fashion, I bounced back by being the meta abuser I am and locking in Rek'Sai. After a decent Game 3 win, pulling through a Game 4 slobberknocker, and utterly annihilating Game 5 in a dominating fashion, I, PlasmacometX, successfully reverse swept my promotional series.

&amp;#x200B;

After years of being so close, peaking last season at Silver 1 68 LP and losing 14 games straight back down to Silver 4, I finally achieved Gold. I always knew Riot had something against me; it seemed oddly suspicious that I would get the AD/ Hybrid Lux Tops running Glacial Augment, or the Dark Harvest Singeds going 0/10 in lane against a Hecarim. But now, I have finally broke past the barrier, beating down the golden gatekeepers, and can now make my journey to Challenger.

&amp;#x200B;

I would just like to take this moment to thank everyone for pushing me forward in these trying times, and helping me realize that no matter how much you int, if you're good enough and have enough money, you'll just win anyways.

leagueoflegends,"I'm sad that bans were removed, and I am sure that Riot has a good reason for removing them. Based on speculation, I'm guessing that queue times increased, or people were upset that they never got to play certain champions ever again because they were always banned.


My suggestion is that bans should be in ARAM, but they shouldn't be controlled by the players. When a lobby is created, the bans should be selected for the players based on the frequency of appearance in ARAM. For example, if fiddlesticks is the champion that has been appearing in ARAM the most for a given amount of time (because a lot of people own him, or keep rerolling to get him), he should be on the ban list for that game. This helps increase the variety of champions that players get, while also allowing ARAM only accounts to get their OP picks occasionally. It helps increase the randomness of the mode by reducing the frequency of certain champions if too many people are getting them. It also helps in reducing the time in lobby because players no longer need to select their bans.

The issue I can see with this idea is that it might result in more dodges if people don't like what was banned."

leagueoflegends,"Yes, I main Riven, and yes I agree she is pretty busted in a winning match up and still pretty overpowered in a losing one (apart from ranged tops, those can go away). Let us look at the number one best way to nerf her which is ""Death's Dance should not affect shields"". This negates some of her so-called tankiness in teamfights due to the synergy of Death's Dance with Conqueror. But I feel like apart from these nerfs, maybe a suggested nerf to passive or lower some base damages on her skills while compensating it by bringing back the R2 missile speed. This will definitely set apart the expert players from the average player. These are just my suggestions of bringing Riven down; well at least in the eyes of NA lul. 

Alright let's go to Vayne, this probably will be the most hated suggestion but why not change Vayne's true stealth on Q during R to a camouflage i.e. such as Evelynn, Rengar, Twitch. Also perhaps revert the W buffs that were given prior. Quite frankly, yes Guinsoos needs some looking into, but the camouflage change or the W damage nerfs will be good enough for now. 

Any other champion nerf suggestions just comment."

I think what made the Bilgewater event fun was the item GhostWalker allowed melee bruisers without gap closers to flank the enemy team unexpectedly. This is a great answer to poke champions because they can’t just sit back and poke safely, there are vulnerable to flanks. 

Snowball let’s melee champions get close, but it is hard to land and too predictable for the enemy. All they need to do is to wait out the snowball and go back to poking.

What hurts worse is in today's META she'd be a breath of fresh air. A powered up auto attack, the extra movement and attack speed, the charge -&gt; stun into a wall, and greatest of all that unique and sexy ultimate where no enemy apart from the one you designate as your victim could damage you while you launch yourself through enemy lines to greet their ADC with your mighty hammer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh my dearest Poppy. I remember you well.

Trinity Force, Phantom Dancer, Statik Shiv, Infinity Edge, Guardian Angel, and of course Speedy Boots.

Better yet in today's game you could add in Spear of Shojin and GA would be even more effective for her, 

Would you be the most popular out there? 

no.. no.

you would."

leagueoflegends,"To begin I'm a D1 one trick with thousands of Kayn games. Although 99% of my games are with Red Form so keep in mind I have a bias advantage in blue form being weak so that kayn isn't banned.   

However, my complete honest opinion is that Blue Kayn before the buff was way too weak in the late game, and still is. The problem with the E buffs (which reduces Blue Forms E CD to 8 seconds) is that it pushes Blue Kayns advantage even more into the early game. The E buffs allow him to Heal more often, while clearing camps, getting to camps faster, and gank more often. This only magnifies the strengths of a fed kayn and it also allows for many unfair mechanics. Blue Kayn is able to gank from walls and poke enemy laners under their own tower. With this buff Blue kayn;s W and E CD are very similar and allow him to spam E's from inside walls and hit Laners FULLY UNDER TOWER on an 8 SECOND CD. Kayn is faster, can heal more, can poke more, can farm more and healthier.  

Thats about it for now, Thanks for reading it this far if u have.

leagueoflegends,"Ya know, since Riven is ranked 12th in the toplane globally in terms of win rate, and r/leagueoflegends seems to be convinced she's imminently about to be nerfed into the ground.. I figured we should nerf all the champs with better winrates top than she has to make things fair.

I know Riven's overall ranking of 54th (50.5% win rate) is vErY sPo0ky, so I have a list of [53 other champs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/builds/iron/by-winrate) that also deserve nerfs. I just couldn't fit them into the title.

But hey. I know what you're thinking. **""But who cares about the 91.94% of players** (a mere 101.1 million losers) **stuck below Platinum? Only Plat+ should count!""** And you're right. We're all about fairness here. That's why I'm suggesting nerfs to the following broken, OP champs with better win rates:

* Sona
* Ahri
* Taric
* Kayle
* Jinx
* Kog'Maw
* Nami
* Ashe

And I forgot, I'm on r/leagueoflegends, so I really should just be talking to all of us Masters and up players. So naturally, I recommend the following broken, OP champs ALSO be nerfed for their better-than-Riven win %:

* Talon
* Zilean
* Katarina
* Shyvana
* Heimerdinger
* Annie
* Cassiopeia
* Taric (double-nerf please)
* Kog'Maw (double-nerf please)
* Wukong (double-nerf please)
* Karthus
* Orianna
* Fizz
* Gnar
* Malzahar
* Sona (double-nerf please)
* Miss Fortune
* Ashe (double-nerf please)
* Vi
* Kindred
* Nidalee
* Diana
* Shaco

By my count, we have just around 79, broken, OP champs that deserve nerfs just as badly as the oppressive, disgusting Riven. My apologies to NA and EUW though, as I've been told that the figures are misleading, and they actually represent around 96% of the playerbase. What's fair is fAiR. Make it happen Riot!"
leagueoflegends,"In any other lane it matters less and less

But let’s go through what you can expect first picking in top

Going Irelia? Get ready to get spirit bombed by Renekton/Kennen/Fiora/Camille/Viktor

Going Riven? Get ready to get violated by Renekton/Kennen/Viktor/Camille

Going Camille? Get ready to be put 6 feet under by Jax/Fiora/Ryze/Vlad

Going Renekton? Get ready to be spanked by Jax/Kennen/Camille/Viktor/Ryze

And not to mention the occasional Vayne top, Cass top, Aftershock Lissandra and Poppy to brighten your 100 contrast day

It’s so frustrating and I don’t know what a solution would be. The lane is in such good favor for second pick unless second pick wants to also pick another champ that goes 50/50 against yours and it’s a skill matchup. Which is rare as fuck"

leagueoflegends,"When are the new skins for this patch coming to the store?  
I've been waiting all day and I just want my dear zed skin so bad..."
leagueoflegends,"Just a disclaimer: This isn't a circlejerk about Riven OP WTF RIOT. It's more about their new philosophy behind Buffs and Nerfs.

  
Riot came forward and said that they have been looking at specific data points to determine when a champion needs to be nerfed. High playrate (in high and/or low ELO), high banrate  (in high and/or low ELO), and high presence in pro-play are all considerations for nerfs under this new scheme. Because of this scheme, however, certain champions will skirt the line and miss out on nerfs for too long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either 1). Riot is being dishonest about why they aren't nerfing strong, high-skillcap, solo-carry picks or 2). Their design philosophy is flawed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe it is PROBABLY the latter. There is a certain class of champion (we'll call them master race) that have intense mechanics, high skill cap, high mobility, and lots of outplay potential. These champions include things like Katarina, Zed, Yasuo, Riven, Vayne, Akali, Fizz, Irelia, Camille, etc. These are champions that should be HARD TO MASTER, and that should be clear in win rates. **I consider these champions balanced when they hover around a 50% winrate with a data curve that is skewed to the left when comparing WR against ELO or # of games played** (essentially, low winrate with new users and low ELO and higher with more games played and higher ELO). 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually think the issue with these champion designs in general are that they aren't gated behind conditional power. They usually have high damage output combined with anti-retaliation (this is stealth, shields, dashes, etc.) This is odd to me. Characters that are mobile should have to sacrifice SOMETHING, but Riven's current power level comes with no expense. She's to forgiving to play, so people can be sloppy with her and win---this is true about most of the master race.   

&amp;#x200B;

This is why the blanket philosophy of any champ with WR &gt; X% is questionable. It doesn't give us the full picture. Certain champions that should be difficult to play, shouldn't be sitting at a high positive winrate, because that's not what the master-race class is about. 

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion? Rebalance these champions to have conditional windows of power. Make it so Akali's damage has to ramp up instead of giving her so much burst at 6. Reward her for hitting multiple Qs in a row, for example, and punish her for missing them (and I'm not talking about giving her movement speed toward her target &gt;\_&gt;), maybe having the Qs damage increase with each successful hit. Or increase the execute scaling on her ult but reduce the base damage. Make Riven have to question whether she should ult by having R convert her DF and MR into AD, make her E scale off DF instead of AD. Vayne's ult and silver bolts are (shudder) fine I guess, but get rid of the Ult-Q stealth until max rank. Yasuo.... nevermind.   


ASIDE: Don't get me started on the banning philosophy either. There are so many champions at this point that we probably don't have enough bans to give Riot Analytics an accurate view of what's OP."

leagueoflegends,"As someone who hit diamond 2 recently, which is more or less high elo (with the exception of some idiots saying pLaT 1- lOw mAstErs iS miD eLo) I really need to talk about the amount of gatekeeping and circlejerking over this concept.

**First let's talk about gatekeeping ""high elo""**

1. The bar for high elo changes based on what your rank is. If you're plat, high elo starts at diamond. If you're ""low diamond"", high elo starts at mid/high diamond. If you're ""mid diamond"", high elo starts at d2. If you're d2, high elo starts at d1. If you're d1, high elo starts at low masters. If you're low masters, high elo starts at an arbitrary lp threshold.

2. In d4/d3 games, you CONSTANTLY have people reminding you of how they can't stand ""this elo"" and how they can't wait to get back to d2 or d1 and get away from ""low elo"".  

3. And then you have the smurfs. The extremely toxic ones who think they're hot shit with their bought account and say things like, if you suggest them to do something like group, ""are YOU telling ME how to play???"" and ""do you know who you're talking to?"" and ""me and my duo are multi-season masters stfu low elo"" 

Yeah, these ""im a multi-season masters stfu low elo, are YOU telling ME how to play???"" people actually exist. If you want examples. FYI if you see the accounts are inactive, just know that they were playing less than a week ago until they got temp or permabanned for toxicity over multiple games. 

https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=adc+enjoyer

https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=account+sharing

**Now let's talk about the REALITY of ""high elo""**

1. People kept making it sound like d1-masters-gm players are SO much better than the average mere mortal d4 player. How d1 players are some gods while d4 players are garbage peasants. That's simply not true. For d2 promos I've played against numerous gms and d1s and there are many, many, many of them that aren't actually great players, but got carried there by specializing in overpowered champions at the moment, or champions that require zero macro but are good at assassinating people and thrive in a solo queue environment. They are no better than the average d4 player. They just got luckier with their champion specialization. Want a spoiler list of what champions can artificially increase your rank? Riven, nasus, jax, sona/soraka, hecarim, and the ubiquitous braindead assassin junglers in NA solo queue (kha zix, rengar, master yi). There are more, but these are the more egregious ones. This ""conqueror"" rune means you don't actually have to be good to win at this game, you just need to be able to all-in people effectively. 

2. There are a metric shit ton of ""smurfs"" and ""used to be d1/d2/pro/whatever"" players that have massively overblown egos as they play in the ""lowly"" ranks of d4/d3. These people tend to blame their teammates for being so low elo and have a superiority complex when in fact they themselves suck dick. The smurfs in particular think they are hot shit-- just because you play rengar and can stat check enough people to rise in rank does not mean that you're better at this game than a d4.

----

Tl;DR

All I want to say is that this gatekeeping and circle jerking over ""high elo"" is literally counting each millimeter in a dick measuring contest. 

Plenty of GM players are not much better than their d4/d3 counterparts. All diamond players are generally good and should be considered high elo. D1/D2 is not worlds better than D3/D4 like I keep on hearing. Many times the real difference between a d3 and a gm is which champion they chose to abuse."

leagueoflegends,"So basically after a game of league I got a notification in the post-game lobby about a survey. It asked about how familiar I am with a set of champions and then asked about 3 champions in particular (in my case - Vayne, Lucian, Jax) . There were questions about what, in my opinion, makes the champions what they are, for example, Vayne has red glasses, tumbles, goes invisible, is a monster hunter etc, and asked what mechanics or characteristics I enjoy about the champions, in my mind I was like - Oh lord, the League MMO or Movie  is gonna happen, because why would they ask the questions. But then they threw me off with lore questions, like what I know about these champions. What would I keep and would i want to see champion connections lore-wise, for example -  Vayne - Evelynn, Lucian - Thresh, Miss  Fortune, Jax - Fiora. I thought this was interesting to share and maybe someone had the same survey and can tell more about different champions.

**TL;DR - Riot asked in a survey about some champions, their characteristics, what I'd like to keep about them, possible surveying for a MMO, and lore questions, like what would I like to know about the champions, possible surveying  for a lore update.**

I am required to include a description of this submission as image posts without content besides the title are not allowed. The image provides a somewhat humorous, but also serious, look at the plight of junglers and their limited sources of gold and XP on Summoner's Rift, the most played map in League of Legends. One frustrating aspect of jungling is when someone on my team decides to take the Rift Scuttler. I am unsure, but I feel that other junglers may also feel similar to me in situations where a team mate needlessly kills this objective and I fall behind slightly as a result. It's also somewhat educational and might make people in future games think twice before killing the Rift Scuttler when the jungle is able to do so with minimal risk.

I hope this paragraph description contextualizing the submission is enough for the auto moderator not to remove the post as it has done three times already. This was mainly made of out of frustration, but I ended up just frustrating myself even more because I had to waste time writing this, as well as preparing the initial flowchart (this was likely a sunken cost fallacy, too bad). I hope I get at least one or two comments from other junglers who say ""yeah buddy, I feel you!"" so I can validate my time investment in this ultimately fruitless creation.

*Automod message*:

**This submission has been removed because posts need to have context and content besides the title. Please resubmit with a post body describing your submission.**

Like Sona, was insulting my csing and called for me to be reported as soon as i did my three ""thanks"" thing. Which was literally just them dying back to back in my lane over and over giving jinx IE at 9 minutes. It might have said things like ""if i die i die"" but I clearly didn't stop playing or trying. I was clearly trying harder than the sona who was the person who reported me. So how is it that what I said vs her actions and insults towards me is more punishable? Or how about the katarina that ignored pings to not try and 1v2 the jinx and alistar? I'm fine being punished, but it doesn't seem all that fair given the full context of the game and the sona that followed me around stealing whatever cs or camps i went for while flashing her emotes at me. If you don't want frustration to boil over in your games you should probably create a system that actively punishes griefers who create these situations. I objectively said nothing terrible and actively called one of my random teammates decent. Granted, I guess I did say ""yall are bad"", I shouldn't have but seriously...they legitimately just kept diving one by one on this jinx. Also, my buddy thing wasn't passive aggressive. That's how I talk, good or bad.

I know it's never been officially announced what's going to happen to Clash, however the last official update was 6 months ago. Considering Clash was officially announced December 2017, I'd be surprised if Clash ever becomes what it was originally announced as: ""a team-based competitive mode that’ll run a couple of times each month""
* They announce the addition of a permanent gamemode - Nexus Blitz, just to hold back on releasing it permanently. In the wrap-up, it was said that ""the vast majority of players preferred to switch back to their usual modes"". However, I'd be curious to know if they accounted for how many players were still playing Nexus Blitz compared to other permanent modes that aren't Summoner's Rift maps, such as ARAM. Even closer to the end of Nexus Blitz, it seemed that the queue times were pretty short and everyone I talked to still seemed to love the mode. While I ""switched back to my usual mode"", I still played a decent amount of Nexus Blitz and it was quite refreshing to play a mode so different from the rest
* Speaking of ARAM, they announce bans approximately one month ago (a long requested feature), just to announce the reversal of it in Patch 9.8. The latest patch notes talk about how ""After much discussion and weighing your feedback, bans will not be a permanent feature in ARAM"". However, from what I have seen there has been a lot of positive feedback on ARAM bans, and it appears that Riot seems to be ignoring the positive feedback to focus on the negative. Just looking at the League Gameplay forums right now, it seems there are a lot more people that want to keep bans then have them removed

It seems Riot keeps trying new things, however they keep resorting back, unwilling to make any new changes permanent.  The only changes that seem to be permanent are ones that are effective in Summoner's Rift, and they seem to be unwilling to touch any other mode. While the maps and modes in Summoner's Rift are all good, I'd love to see more changes in other places in the game.

The 3 examples I posted above were the ones I could remember off the top of my head, as these were the main ones that stuck out to me. I'd like to ask that Riot reconsider taking more risks with these, as these changes were all great and I don't think I'm the only one that would love to see these changes permanently added."

leagueoflegends,[NSFW] Rakan &amp; Xayah having fun
leagueoflegends,"The loading screen before the game starts takes like a minute? Why is that? I thought it might be because of other players, but in games like overwatch every single games loads in less than 10 seconds.

I was wondering what you guys think the reason is? It CAN'T be because other people are slow because other people also play other games and none of the other games I play load this slow including games with a high rate of players from 'low income' nations like PUBG and CSGO.

Anyone know what? Has riot said anything about optimizing this?"
leagueoflegends,"So I started my Flex Queue placements 4-0 with questionable matchmaking. Every single game our team was full Dia/Master against Gold + Plat autofilled players.  Every single game our team were 3 or 4 premades against 5 randoms in the enemy team on top of the huge division difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, things turned around very quickly and I lost 6 straight games in a row. Every single game without exception, I queued for Support and Bot and got placed Jungle/Top. Not a single game out of 6 did I get my Main or Secondary role on top of getting placed with 4 other solo players against 4 (2x2) or 5 premades.

This is a picture of my last and 6th loss. 5 of us are autofilled against 5 premades and except me (Hecarim), NO ONE has a single game played on their champion. A SINGLE FUCKING GAME. Our duo bot openly stated that they are high and want to troll but that wouldn't make any difference at all. Despite them ending the game 1-14 everything was lost from the matchmaking system.

&amp;#x200B;

At level 3, I'm forced to play against 3-4 control wards and 4 people instantly rotating to defend a jungle camp with via voice communication. I don't want to play against premades every single game. I honestly never want to play against a group of 5 premades ever again, but this is legitimately killing every single bit of fun I can take from the game. I've been playing for 9 years and this is by far, the worst Solo/Flex Queue experience I have ever had.

Many pro players are already speaking out about how premades need to be removed, but I honestly can't find a single game mode to play where premades aren't at least 6/10 of the people in the game. If premades don't get removed, there should at least be a system where 2 premades get matched against 2 premades with no exceptions. I would honestly prefer to wait 20 minutes per queue just so I never get another premade in my games every again, this is simply ridiculous."

Looks like their normal day to me.


On the ancient, mystical borders of Ionia's deep forests live the last of the Lhotlan vastaya. It is a place where magic is breathed like air and time has little meaning. To these chimeric creatures, the mortal realms have become like an unforgiving desert, virtually devoid of magic. Few willingly travel far from their shrinking lands, but Rakan has long walked a riskier path. He journeys along the edges of the world's magical streams, as an explorer, emissary, and song catcher for his tribe.

An entertaining rogue, a welcome performer for any tavern or village carnival, Rakan was content with the simple adventures of this life on the road... until he had a chance encounter with Xayah at the harvest festival in Vlonqo."

leagueoflegends,"I play kayn but I'm far from an expert but just looking at the numbers before and after is a bit baffling.

Their claim is that red form is always superior and this extreme buff in my opinion as to how blue kayn out, but regardless the seems a little over the top to literally anyone that plays League.

I mean literally why would you go from that cool down that he had before to a FLAT 8 seconds? I mean this could cause so many problems I could go on and on, but one of them is kayn unsuccessfully ganking a lane using Shadow step, which is an extremely strong Mobility spell for ganking, then just waiting a few seconds with just 20% cooldown what you get extremely quickly and coming back

I just see this as a huge issue and if you want to give some love to Blue form that's fine and dandy but why you went from 21/19/17/15/13 to 8 seconds FLAT ILL SAY IT AGAIN FLAT MEANING YOU PUT 1 POINT IN THAT ABILITY AND ITS I SECONDS, is beyond me.

Also just the mobility around the map is going to be laughable, even laughable compared to what it already is right now. He's extremely fast and covers ground in the same way, after this it's just going to ludicrous.

If I'm ignorant in anyway feel free to call me out, I enjoyed playing kayn and think he's overall a decent champ but I really have no idea why they jumped from a 21 second starting CD at level one, going down to seconds per rank, to a FLAT 8 SECONDS AT ALL RANKS."

**CHAMPIONS WHO STEAMROLL WITH A LEAD SHOULDN'T BE STATTED FOR SUCCESS IN LANE AS THE DEFAULT ASSUMPTION. AND WHEN THEY ARE, THEY MOST DEFINITELY DON'T NEED 8 CCs AND A RESSURECTION FOR TEAMFIGHTING**"
leagueoflegends,"Hey guys, I'm writing this post because these little shits are ruining the league experience for so many people.

I've been playing this game a long time, since the end of season 1 actually. In season 4 I reached my peak (Diamond) and started playing much less since then. Lately, I've been getting back into league on a fresh account. I'm not as good as I used to be (maybe gold), but I'm still stuck in silver for now. Anyway, I've been running into elo boosters in silver. These guys are probably high diamond maybe even master or something like that. They play so well that even when our top mid and jungle are winning they can still come out on top by playing very well bottom lane.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, these eloboosters usually play adc/support. They often duo together so then can boost more effectively.

If you look in their [op.gg](https://op.gg) matchhistory for the past 40 games or so, you can see they play normal games, some ranked, flex etc. Usually a record along the lines of win-win-loss-win-loss-loss-loss-win-loss-win-loss-loss-win. Pretty much 50%W/50%L. Sometimes with decent scores, but also often with terrible scores.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, when you look at their most recent games (the last 10/20 or so) you can see they suddenly go on 10 game winning streaks with crazy scores. Usually 5KDA something like that. Out of those for 20 games they win 16 or 17 usually. Like i said, these guys usually duo adc/supp. Jinx seems like a common pick in combination with a heavy cc support which can both engage but also defend the adc leona/thresh.

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples of profiles below, where players go from playing normal games, with average scores and average winratio's to insane win-streaks, crazy KDA's etc.

These 2 play together:

&amp;#x200B;

It's very annoying to play against (or even with) players that are several divisions above you... Takes away the competitive aspect entirely. Trust me it's infuriating when your top lane goes 5-0 mid 4-1 jungle 4-0 and you still lose because your bot gets annihilated and their bots snowballs your nexus."

leagueoflegends,4/17 PBE Update: Tentative Balance Changes
leagueoflegends,"I was playing Teemo against Sylas and it really felt unfair he instantly had 3 mushrooms at lvl 6 while I only had one.

I mean, sometimes this may be irrelevant, but if your jungler is ganking him and he gets lvl 6 he can automatically place 3 shrooms, which can make him win the 1 v 2, put 1 on the minion wave, 1 in a bush, 1 behind him, etc etc. having 3 shrooms can totally change the fight if well played

so I don't understand why HIS STOLEN ULTIMATE is better than my own ultimate. he should start with 1 shroom and charge them 2 more times instead of starting with 3. AT LEAST at lvl 6

I don't know how it works with corky for example or other champions with charges (I don't know if there's another actually)

but as Teemo it is certainly unfair."

Base health regeneration increased to 7 from 5.5.
Blade of the Exile Blade of the Exile
Cooldown reduced to 120 / 90 / 60 seconds from 130 / 95 / 60.

Here it is copy and pasted directly from the wiki.

Now we move onto the elephant in the room that is the **Conqueror Ruin**, to say this ruin is controversial for a lot of people would be an understatement.

Its problems also go beyond just Rivens kit and spills into nearly every a lot of other top laners

It goes over to Hecarim/Kayn when he chooses Rhaast/Urgot/Yasou/Illaio (in some cases)/Rek'Sai and Renekton.

The rune has led to nerfs on these characters when the base cause of the problems where the rune.

In my honest opinion Conqueror needs to be nerfed hard/changed and maybe even reworked down the lane because currently a lot of characters are receiving to much of a benefit from it."

When I lost two of my games, it said I lost zero points (is this a bug), and I seemed to play only vs Silver and Gold ranked people, despite being in Bronze. Is the League system bugged, or doesn't it affect with what people I play?

leagueoflegends,"Hey guys, recently i climbed g2 to p3 on a winstreak. I had overall 60% winrate and was getting about +22lp on win and -17 on loss... However I was at 22lp p3, lost 4 games in a row, got back to p4 and currently getting -22 on loss and +14 on win while getting matched constantly with p2-g1 players. Average team mmr p4 according to opgg. Currently sitting at 67W 57L. I don't think this is normal... I am actually discouraged to play ranked anymore. So little reward for winning... I went like 21-8 from g2 to p3 and was still getting +21 or +22, but I lose 4 in a row and get in a horrible position... +14 on win -22 on loss..."

What changes when my champ levels up? (In dota heroes gain +x Int/Str/Agi per level)

How I calculate magic resistance? (In dota every hero has 25% base magic resist + itens/skills)

How do I know if a skill is physical or magical?

How to calculate physical resistance? (In dota we have a X% reduction based on hero armor)

Are there any other damage type or things like that?

I'd like to know everything, starting with the basics and how thing scale in the game. 

Sorry using dota as an exemple, but I know the game very well and correlating things would help.
Thanks."

leagueoflegends,"So every game, i kinda just play it as i see it unfolding. Like if im vayne against like a Kayla in mid, ill get dorans blade or the 350gp blade under bloodthirster. If im up against like..a zyra, which is annoying or karthus ill get dorans shield. And then eventually always get tier 2 boots, work towards bloodthirster. 
But I make it a point to try as many champs as i can. I have love for em all. Zoe, kayle, vayne, Ashe, corki, akali, i love playing with em all and learning different roles. I like hecarim and shaco for jg. At the beginning of thode games, theres usually a 300gp jungle item. Or that 500gp health one that resets when u base. 
What im getting at is can someone Please tell me like..what i should normally be building too? Bloodthirster and phantom dancer? But i truly do understand to change it up depending on the situation. But i still am just asking for like. The 5 or 6 for sure item paths i should only keep in my head as options. Instead of the randomly going to hextech gunblade or rageblade or botrk or bloodthirster just depending on the situation. 
Also, when i click on a high cost item, and the cheaper ones i can afford listed under it are click-buyable. Does that mean like. If i buy sword and vampiric on the left, do i still need to buy the sword om the right? Or save up the 2600 to get the top end result item? Or how is that working?
Any help would be app re ciated as to the specific way that works so i can start planning more accurately."

leagueoflegends,"I enjoy league a lot, I have been playing since season 3 and ever since I started I have been so entertained with this game and every part of it, however, when I play this game I get unbelievably frustrated. It seems like every other game I am insanely tilted either from a teammate, an annoying champion, or some bug/lag in-game and i just end up in a really shitty mood and complain in voice chat for the majority of the game.  I can imagine it would be really annoying to whoever I am talking to, but luckily most of my friends don't seem to mind it too much, and they do their fair share of complaining as well (although I definitely complain more).  Thankfully, I very rarely start flaming/being toxic in-game to other players.  A few minutes after the game is over I am usually completely fine and have calmed down, and the game doesn't even matter to me anymore.  I think a huge reason that this game is so frustrating imo is because we are trapped in a game for probably around 30 minutes on average. In this game, even the smallest mistakes can snowball into something huge, and when you get behind due to some bullshit you feel trapped in a hopeless game for a long time it just feels really shitty.  When I play ADC, it gets 10x worse.  ADC isn't my main, or even my secondary, however a lot of my friends are support players so they often enjoy it if I go bot lane with them.  I don't understand why, maybe it's because i'm not the best at the role, but i'd say about 80% of the games I play adc in I get so pissed. that role feels sooooo awful to play sometimes no matter it's state of balance.  I have tried several times to just not get angry and just to not comment on anything that happens, but this game pisses me off beyond anything else.  Does anyone else feel this way?"
leagueoflegends,"
‪Make his W two seperate casts.‬

‪• 1st cast: dash forward, but unable to cast any abilities during the dash and up to X seconds after dashing. ‬

‪• 2nd cast: After dashing and arriving to a designated location, he has up to X seconds to cast W again, knocking enemies up. The longer he stands in place after dashing the bigger his knockup circle grows. Casting any ability other than W2 after W1 cancels his ability to cast W2 entirely. (e.g. you CANNOT W1, E, W2)

Basically what this does is it allows Rakan to retain a fast dash on his W, creates a risk/reward aspect to it too, and solves the issue of the R W combo where the player can now
• either cast R, dash in, (charming enemies) then if you are willing to knock up multiple enemies, youd have to wait long enough to do so, and by then the charm effect would have worn off (or makes it easier to QSS and walk out of the growing knockup circle)
• or he could opt for quick R W1 W2 instantly to catch 1 enemy off-guard.

leagueoflegends,"To start this off, yes I'm a Rakan main, so you can see why I'm making this post. 
But I was wondering, how is this decided? It wasn't as though Rakan was pick/ban, he's just... good in pro play. I actually felt like he was in a really good post-nerf state, something a lot of champions don't get. He doesn't have the instant engage he once did, and his max range w is much easier to dodge than it used to be.
 There are a lot of champions who are good in competitive games. We see a lot of Zoe, Irelia, Rek'sai, that new Sona-Taric combo, and Braum pretty much dominates competitive. I'd say they're all in pretty decent spots balance wise, they're just strong. Rakan is definitely far from pick-ban status, and I wouldn't say he's limiting any other champ choices, so what deems him problematic?"

If that queue is supposed to be played by teams, why am I allowed to play solo against a probable premade of 3?

Is not that I'm complaining, but once I reach gold in that queue, why should I keep playing it? Am I to believe that queue is only to be played with friends?

leagueoflegends,"For anyone newer who isn't aware, Jaximus is a skin with a special line Riot added for Joe, a 17 year old who visited HQ. Joe sadly later passed away after losing his battle with cancer. Jaximus was Joe's favorite skin, and so a line was added - ""Here's to you, kid."" - as a tribute to Joe.[1]

Back in 2015, Riot was going to put the skin into the legacy vault, but a reddit post caused Riot to rethink putting him away. Instead, Jaximus was tagged as a legacy skin even though he would never be removed from the store.[2]

I don't know when this legacy tag was removed, but as of today, he does not turn up in the shop under Limited Availability.[3]

Was there an offical announcement regarding this removal, or has this simply been overlooked?

leagueoflegends,"Both:

* have average AP ratios, but high base damage

* can play support, regulary dealing the most damage on their team even when underfed

* deal tons of AoE damage

* are a threat even to tanks (Brand has %hp-damage, Vel'Koz has true damage)

* have 1 semi-reliable hard CC

* can restore mana in some way

However, Vel'Koz...

* has slightly better AP ratios in total

* has even better instant waveclear in mid (he either can double-W to clear the wave and avoid any interaction, or do the same while poking you with his Q from 500 miles away)

* has a slightly better mana restore than Brand (idk about you, but I literally never saw a Vel'Koz running OOM)

* has a longer range than Brand

The only disadvantage Vel'Koz has over Brand is the fact that he has no point and click ability, while Brand has his E. (He also has to channel his ultimate, but the high range, combined with Brand's unreliable bounce mechanic kinda evens this out.)

Yet, whenever people talk about supports or ARAM, their flame victim is usually Brand. (And I actually don't mind, Brand is not really fun to play against.) But nobody speaks about the eye tentacle, even when he tears your whole team apart from like the other side of the map, with only boots + first item.

leagueoflegends,"I waited some time to give my opinion on this because I always want to give big changes time to be buffed, nerfed, or changed to make them more balanced, but I think it's been enough time. Crit items right now are clearly too strong, again. I honestly do not understand why riot reverted the changes, yes crit wasn't that strong and impactful last summer after the changes, but they should have stuck with it and tried budding the items rather than just reverting them back to a point where they were clearly too strong. Nearly every game right now an adc gets fed and become nearly unstoppable because they finished two or more crit items. While yes you can try to catch your adc back up to compete(or have a fed assassin), but I don't know how many times I've played jinx, or Tristan, or Caitlyn or any crit adc and hard carried games because I finished a couple crit items and can 2-3 shot everyone on the enemy team with auto attacks. How is that fun for anyone except adcs?

How is anyone supposed to climb or improve when they only face much higher elo players. Can something be done?

BUT how bout irelia and akali who were VERY broken for MANY seasons, they didnt do anything for the longest time but with any other champs who are strong (not broken) they nerf the shit out of them. they smack the chance for a new champ to hop in the meta i honestly think the balance team is full of silvers who cant play the game then play agaisnt a good player then they complain for a nerf

I understand that for some this is like a stress relief but come on, we are just learning, be patient. I’m not even ranked why do you get angry if I still don’t know how to be pro at a certain lane/champ

2. You don’t have to keep playing with someone if they are being toxic, even if they are cute or you have consider them your friends for a long time or they introduced you to league :c

3. It’s important to put wards and look at the map 

4. If you see someone in your team is not doing good try to give advice and it’s ok say ‘shut up’ to the ones that are toxic

4. You need to kill as many minions as possible (but no if you are sup or jg or you are not in your lane)

5. You need to have a positive attitude, even if you get sad easily like me, keep trying. Someday you can be good at this if you continue putting effort. (I’m not sure about this last point but I like to think that someday I will carry my team)"

leagueoflegends,"Title. First, elo differences correspond to a real difference in how much players do to win the game. That's just a fact. You can draw whatever conclusions about what it means to be ""good"" from that that you want. Is someone good if they play one champion? Four? A hundred? Or if they're gold? Or diamond? Idgaf, think what you want. The point is players at higher elo tend to beat players at lower elo, you can disagree with the normative stuff people impute to that but it's just what it is.

Second there probably is an interesting and worthwhile discussion to be had about how exclusionary the league community's concepts of high elo or good players are. It's definitely something particular to online communities-I'm sure you've had similar experiences of telling people your rank in real life and having them almost freak out, whereas online it's just meh. Whether that's because only high elo players self select into forums (but I doubt that there are actually 2,751,847 challengers out there) or something about forums tends to diminish people (I definitely think a certain type of cynicism and sneering is popular here). It might also just be that since there's nothing that's bad in an absolute sense, people just call themselves as motivation and a reminder to improve. Idk. In any case, it does seem a bit weird for a community to think negatively about at least 9/10 of its members. Like even the 9 themselves think that way? Or what? Maybe negative is too general a word, but you get the point-it seems sort of weird and I'd like to hear your explanations."

Like, I get that its banter but I see them fucking up all the time, the only difference is that I dont shit talk them for it. I constantly feel like Im beeing judged and I have to ""prove"" myself even tho I think Im just as good if not better than them. We're all still friends at the end but I feel like it kinda damages my gameplay when I play with them. Im to afraid to miss critical abillities so I commit that often and when I do I overthink stuff and sometimes fins myself missing as well..."

leagueoflegends,"A week ago or so, in one of the quick gameplay thoughts, riot talked about how they wanted to reduce the junglers dependence on laners in the early game.

So I decided to play a game on PBE to try some new changes and to get that juicy 3000 RP to buy some skins, and I realized that the scuttle did not spawn at the usual 2 minute mark. 

I am not entirely sure but I think it spawned around 3 minute mark which gives junglers enough time to path more effectively to get level 3 without lane reliance

As a jungle main, I am really happy with this change and I think most of the laners may welcome it because as far as i know many people do not like when they need to shove and leave their lane and when the game is decided at 2 minutes

Then again, I might be biased because of my role but I am curious about your thoughts

Correct me if this change was stated somewhere, I did not see it, so sorry if anyone brought it up before"

Every time I die to a melee auto attack after I flash it just doesn’t seem to make sense for me. I’d love to know everyone else’s opinions."

leagueoflegends,"I can't wrap my head around the rationale for this nerf. If they're nerfing Kennen because he's abusing kleptomancy and playing like Gnar where he just AAs and disengages, why push a nerf that will destroy his traditional close-range/engage mage playstyle and **encourage** the use of his E for nothing but disengage? 



Trying to hit an enemy with your E will be suicidal now. The movement speed alone is what allows him to avoid fighting, the resistances aren't that important for Klepto Kennen but they're absolutely essential to other playstyles. 


tl;dr the nerf makes no sense. It's going to leave Klepto Kennen unchanged until outside of laning phase where Klepto is less impactful, and it's going to murder other Kennen builds."

So we have a Ziggs/Zyra bot who fed beyond repair,

then our pantheon feeds aswell and is worthless.

Why the FUCK is this allowed?

This is like my 10th post on this sub showcasing a game like this, this ALWAYS happens EVERY SINGLE solo Duo game i have played. in 1 way or another.

Im literally on the verge of being done with this fucking game because theres no incentive to get on and play if every single game theres at least 1 person who feeds beyond control.

And ive noticed that no matter what i do or how i play i cant avoid getting shitty people like this on my team CONSISTENTLY.

it makes this game unfun to play.

So let me get this straight, I was 10-1 up until the point of where it was teamfight phase, and my duo was 12-2; We literally LOST because 3 of our teammates were feeding to the point where if Me or my Duo were not present, the small jungle fights were lost, turrets, objectives, everything.

Annnnd we lose, and i lose rank and so does my duo; annnnd we played better than the enemy team, and our teamamtes.

The best PART IS!

the enemy team had the nerve to call me trash and say 'gg ez' as if they dont see how it was a 2v5 ??

Why the fuck is that allowed anyways?

so i have feeders on my team and i have the best score in the game, but i lose and this person gets to say 'gg ez'.

got it.

I'm done with ranked. I might be done with this game honestly, there's no fucking incentive to put in effort or anything of the sort if im CONSTANTLY met with shit like this.

And im pretty freaking sure that there has been MANY people who have quit this game for similar reasons.

RIOT does NOTHING (0) about feeders, they do nothing to soften the blow of losing a game where you didn't do ANYTHING that led to the loss, they do nothing about how people can just blatantly be toxic about a fucking game where the the other team has feeders.

Keep focusing on Esports Riot.. actually nvm I don't care.

Im patiently waiting for the day This game Dies, however long into the future that may be, to the point of where the servers close and everyone loses their accounts.

Fuck riot, people who feed in league games,and the people who openly defend this."
leagueoflegends,"After reading u/Blaustoise's tweet on Riot's [Mastery Curves](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/a7rfsp/riot_blaustoise_shares_mastery_curve_data_on/) methodology, I tried to reproduce something similar with the data available on leagueofgraphs.com and I thought I would share my results.

This is a very crude method, using my eyeballs and statistics that could have all sorts of confounding factors, so use it with discretion. It passes the smell test for myself, so I think it's at least a useful starting point.

Methodology: Go to leagueofgraphs.com. Find champion. Set the division to Iron and above (everyone). Find the Win Rate vs Games Played chart and record the number of games it takes our champion to reach a 50% WR, 51% WR, and so on. The graphs only go as far as 80 games played, so for champions that don't reach a specific WR in 80 games or less I entered in a value of 100 in that cell in order to sort the table, but it could really be a number much larger than that or maybe they never reach that WR, I don't know. Don't blame me when you play 100 games on Ryze and still don't have a 54% win rate. Hell, don't blame me for anything, I warned you that this is crude!

I also added a column taking the ranking of ""The Best Worldwide on Champion"" from lolalytics.com as a rough picture of the potential of the character at the highest level of SoloQ play.

I pulled this a few days ago from 9.7 data, so some of this could have changed by now.

This is mostly a ploy to get u/Blaustoise to be so frustrated at how far off the mark I am that he shares all of the data that Riot has been collecting on Mastery Curves :-)

leagueoflegends,"As someone who hit diamond 2 recently, which is more or less high elo (with the exception of some idiots saying pLaT 1- lOw mAstErs iS miD eLo) I really need to talk about the amount of gatekeeping and circlejerking over this concept.

**First let's talk about gatekeeping ""high elo""**

1. The bar for high elo changes based on what your rank is. If you're plat, high elo starts at diamond. If you're ""low diamond"", high elo starts at mid/high diamond. If you're ""mid diamond"", high elo starts at d2. If you're d2, high elo starts at d1. If you're d1, high elo starts at low masters. If you're low masters, high elo starts at an arbitrary lp threshold.

2. In d4/d3 games, you CONSTANTLY have people reminding you of how they can't stand ""this elo"" and how they can't wait to get back to d2 or d1 and get away from ""low elo"".  

3. And then you have the smurfs. The extremely toxic ones who think they're hot shit with their bought account and say things like, if you suggest them to do something like group, ""are YOU telling ME how to play???"" and ""do you know who you're talking to?"" and ""me and my duo are multi-season masters stfu low elo"" 

Yeah, these ""im a multi-season masters stfu low elo, are YOU telling ME how to play???"" people actually exist. If you want examples. FYI if you see the accounts are inactive, they probably got banned due to toxicity because they say shit like that every game. 

[REMOVED] 

[REMOVED]

**Now let's talk about the REALITY of ""high elo""**

1. People kept making it sound like d1-masters-gm players are SO much better than the average mere mortal d4 player. How d1 players are some gods while d4 players are garbage peasants. That's simply not true. For d2 promos I've played against numerous gms and d1s and there are many, many, many of them that aren't actually great players, but got carried there by specializing in overpowered champions at the moment, or champions that require zero macro but are good at assassinating people and thrive in a solo queue environment. They are no better than the average d4 player. They just got luckier with their champion specialization. Want a spoiler list of what champions can artificially increase your rank? Riven, nasus, jax, sona/soraka, hecarim, and the ubiquitous braindead assassin junglers in NA solo queue (kha zix, rengar, master yi). There are more, but these are the more egregious ones. This ""conqueror"" rune means you don't actually have to be good to win at this game, you just need to be able to all-in people effectively. 

2. There are a metric shit ton of ""smurfs"" and ""used to be d1/d2/pro/whatever"" players that have massively overblown egos as they play in the ""lowly"" ranks of d4/d3. These people tend to blame their teammates for being so low elo and have a superiority complex when in fact they themselves suck dick. The smurfs in particular think they are hot shit-- just because you play rengar and can stat check enough people to rise in rank does not mean that you're better at this game than a d4.

----

Tl;DR

All I want to say is that this gatekeeping and circle jerking over ""high elo"" is literally counting each millimeter in a dick measuring contest. 

Plenty of GM players are not much better than their d4/d3 counterparts. All diamond players are generally good and should be considered high elo. D1/D2 is not worlds better than D3/D4 like I keep on hearing. Many times the real difference between a d3 and a gm is which champion they chose to abuse.

----

edit: About streamers. Streamers have an audience and a bigger platform than us. But just because someone has a bigger, louder microphone doesn't mean that their opinion is more correct. You should still use your own logical judgement and not blindly listen to what streamers have to say-- just like us, they are sometimes correct, and they are sometimes wrong."

leagueoflegends,"Kumo has been an excellent toplaner for C9A, matter of fact, he is the best performing toplaner in Academy and shows a very high ceiling to improve. Dardoch has definitely been very different from his past self through mental fortitude, mechanics, and overall play style. And I know what you all are thinking, LOD/Benji from Envi and Dig? He started playing in the LCS when he was 17 and C9 actually scouted which just set to represent that he showed a potential to be a very good ADC. While he was playing at Dignitas, he was at least revered to be a consistent adc and showed plenty of games where the carry potential from him was obviously prevalent. 

Since this org is an extreme cheapskate, this is the only roster in which we can grow on just like what TSM did to their roster. We have to make sacrifices and let go of our weaknesses, such as taking risks and letting Darshan, Wiggily, and Stixxay go."

leagueoflegends,"**Introduction**

I've been playing the game for quite a long time now (\~3-4 years). I stopped after season 3 and continued recently after graduating and settling down after getting a job (yay me!). I peaked around mid Diamond I in the past before quitting to focus on college, though I played competitively during that time in Overwatch and peaked Grandmaster there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Abstract**

If there's one thing I notice in all competitive team-based games is the lack of personal accountability and self-improvement. For all of us who are Diamond and below and covet higher ranks, we have to start taking charge of what we can do in our games. By being more accountable and reflecting each game on how we can improve, you heighten your gameplay to new levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is more or less a motivational thread rather than one that aims to directly ascertain what exactly you need to be exploiting to climb solo queue, so if you're here for some crazy new discoveries I doubt you'll be pleased to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why You're Stuck, and Why It Feels Hard To Climb**

Doubtlessly, despite how hard it is to hear this, if it is difficult to climb in your elo, it's most likely because you belong there. And I'm not saying this because your mechanics aren't on par, or that your games are filled with people who perform poorly and end up throwing the game for you, because let's be honest, I'm sure many of you can climb given the right opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I've tended to notice is ***inconsistency*** in gameplay. I guess these can come in forms of winstreaks, high KDA, etc. People tend to take these accolades and elevate themselves and their mentality to new levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh I'm on a 8 game win streak. This is what happens when my teammates don't suck.""

""Damn I've improved so much. I definitely deserve to climb.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is a fairly common pattern I see in all of my friends and people online, and it is one that tends to end after a day or two when the slump comes back and you're back to struggling. In order to truly climb, you have to accept the truth, and that it's because of a combination of luck and good gameplay that you happen to do exceptionally well that day.

&amp;#x200B;

In reality, to truly improve you have to work on consistency. For those of you who are into physical sports, I'm sure you can understand the analogy of shooting a basketball. You can go out to a park and shoot hoops 5 hours a day mindlessly and expect to improve, but in reality we all can concede that this is truly not the case. The people who will improve most are the ones who set up a camera, study their form, compare their forms to the correct form, and proceed from there.

&amp;#x200B;

A good, improving player is a smart player. You don't want to be putting in hours of work that aren't as efficient. You want to be out there improving as fast as possible. And you can only do that by being ***consistent.***

&amp;#x200B;

**How Do I Improve Consistency?**

There is a lot that goes on in a league game than you may believe. For those of you who are higher elo, I'm sure you can understand the many nuances that are present throughout the game. And even for us who are masters/diamond, etc., there are even deeper nuances that compose how fluent your overall gameplay can be.

&amp;#x200B;

For this learning's sake, I will argue that there are 3 major components that are integral to a league game.

1. Laning Phase
2. Transition / Mid-Game
3. Late Game (if it gets to here)

&amp;#x200B;

**Laning Phase**

For me, personally, I find laning phase the most fun of all the phases (and often times get disappointed if laning phase goes awry). This is because you can swing the game early and take control. As a support player, I'll be using some bot lane references, but will be trying to keep this empathetic for other lanes as well.

&amp;#x200B;

In all elos that I've been a part of (silver -&gt; d1), I would argue that mechanics are relatively similar, yet it's the failure to recognize opportunity that stunts players and prevents their gameplay from shining. So many players are a unsure of what their objective is during the laning phase. For many, the default is to shove the wave, get level 2, and try to get an HP lead and take control of the lane there. 

&amp;#x200B;

And for many, this works the first few waves in, only for it to backfire and bite them in the ass as the consequences of their decision pops up. 

&amp;#x200B;

The trick to improving your consistency during laning phase is first identifying your win conditions. For botlane, this means pitting your bot lane matchup against the enemy's, and finding the conditions to win. For Vayne/Thresh, this may mean surviving and CSing against a Caitlyn/Nami (since there probably is no opportunity for you to outshove a Caitlyn). For Lucian/Braum against Caitlyn/Nami, this means pushing Caitlyn in, securing priority and avoiding small trades that will whittle you down.

&amp;#x200B;

These conditions are obvious when you sit down and think about them, but are harder to pull off practically when you start coming face to face with people who *also* understand these objectives. It becomes mind games from there on out. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are other components to the laning phase that dictate how well you will do as well. Keeping track of cooldowns and summoner spells is one crucial task as well. Knowing when Morgana's Q is down or when her E is down lets you know exactly when you can go in, and how well an outcome may turn out before you even decide to engage. Comparing items on who went back early and arrived with a pickaxe over your doran's may be the wrong engage, even if you do feel ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Lane positioning is another thing many people get wrong all the time. Sometimes they do it well, and sometimes they bomb it. The issue is many are inconsistent (or simply fail to recognize the gravity of where they are positioned or moving to). Players tend to be split between hyper aggressive or downright passive. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is neither playstyle is correct. You cannot afford to be hyper aggressive, nor passive. It excludes you from all the in betweens. A good player is one who constantly adapts to their situation. The support just went to ward? For a very small window of opportunity, it's a 2v1 botlane and we can go in. Jungler just ganked top? We have an opportunity to fight without anyone interfering.

&amp;#x200B;

The jungler just ganked and went back? We can assume he probably did a topside clear and will be repositioning near botlane. 

&amp;#x200B;

Information is power, and keeping track of the current game state lets you make ***informed*** decisions instead of just yolo'ing and fighting. If you find that you are dying often to ganks, despite feeling like you bully your lane and they have to cry for help just to survive, then this is 100% your fault. Remember, we're all about taking responsibility over things you have *direct* control over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dying to a gank is 100% your fault at any time. Being tower dove is also a mistake. You should be able to recognize when you're being tower dived and abandon your tower accordingly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, wave management is the most crucial thing during laning phase. It affects when your backs to base to buy are good. It affects if the enemy jungler is able to gank you, and it affects how much pressure you apply on the enemy botlane. Lane mechanics is something that is easy to learn in theory, but is harder to master. It's simple to fall into the idioms of ""freeze bot"", or ""crash the wave"", but there are many nuances to lane management that you can find online.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap this, improving laning consistency is one of the best ways to affect the outcome to your games. Identifying win conditions, mastering lane management, and punishing enemy players who fail to play these goals out appropriately is the key to feeling like you have control of  your laning phase. 

&amp;#x200B;

For a lot of people, this means being comfortable CSing under tower 24/7 because you are in a losing matchup (it happens).

&amp;#x200B;

**Mid Game / Late Game**

I find mid game and late game sort of a blend, since the overall goal is to take the correct objectives and to pick and choose your fights correctly. When laning phase ends, most people look to start pressuring objectives like dragon, (herald if it isn't dead yet), or ganking other lanes. This typically means one team's first outer towers have fallen and is typically shortly after the plates on your towers go down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Consistency-wise, since that's the name of the game here, typically involves proper wave management so that you can rotate on objectives accordingly, not navigating the fog of war carelessly unless you're accompanied by teammates, and getting control/vision over the areas of the game your teammates are going to be involved in. 

&amp;#x200B;

In most of the games I've been a part of (in both losses and wins), the frustration of mid-game to late game transitions is the inability to close out games or make headway on objectives. It becomes a stalemate and you find yourself farming and not being very productive. Objectives are typically taken when one person is caught out, or a combination of other factors like wave clear, or overall team composition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being in the right spot, at the right time, and knowing when to leave a lost fight is imperative to being consistent. You don't want to be the one who gets caught out and stalls the momentum of your team for the next 30 seconds. Those really add up over the course of the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Be aware, proactive, and informed in your decisions. Don't say screw it and just do it. Think about what you would do if you were an enemy player. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Words / tl;dr**

I know it's a bit of a read, and I don't blame you if you skipped through most of it. As a summary, the trick to elo climbing is being consistent and making informed decisions. Study, and watch VODs of yourself. Look at your mistakes, and pick apart what *you* can do better. Don't be caught in an endless hole of play game, play game, play game. Stop. Think. And address your issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Each death is something for you to analyze why it led up to the way it was. I guarantee you if you take accountability of your deaths (even if the game is so far gone because of the 0/11 top laner and 3/6 mid) you'll take the next game (or maybe the next one). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening. And I hope some of you can make something of this mess."
leagueoflegends,Every update I get in league the volume mixer in windows puts the client up to 100% volume. I’ve never asked anyone about this so that’s why I’m not sure if it’s changeable. It would be amazing if that didn’t happen every patch but if not I can deal with it no problem.

They either carry or feed, never just average. I'm just amazed that so many people have time to maintain multiple grandmaster accounts and still have a 56% win rate in plat 3. Incredible dedication to their craft I guess."
leagueoflegends,"You almost always see that same champions. And with the roll and the ability to pick one of the other champions people didn't want is that people pick whats strongest and most fun so that makes it even less random.

I swear that I have played Gnar in 4 of my last 5 aram games(PRE ban arams) and the one where I didn't play him, the enemy played him. And I always see Caitlyn, Jhin and Ezreal. To prove my point im gonna play a quick game of ARAM and make an edit with picture of champion select."
leagueoflegends,"Hey guys, I need some help.

Recently I've been getting back into league after a hiatus, and its been going well. Season 9 is fun and the meta is so interesting now.

However recently every single game has been just flaming, flaming, and more flaming.  Literally anything that happens is a million pings and people yelling noob.  It doesn't matter who its directed at. Some games its me. Some games its the midlaner. Some games its the jungler. But theres always someone yelling vile racial epithets or just following someone around soft inting. 

What can I do to combat this? I've tried the kill them with kindness approach but it doesn't seem to work 90 percent of the time. Is there anything that can be done? /muteall is great when you're not trying to shotcall or win...

This is my first time coming to ranked from normals where everyone was chill."
leagueoflegends,My win rate isn't that great. I'm a decent jungler/support/adc/top my weakest role is mid. Just looking for friends to rank with. I do have a mic.
leagueoflegends," 

Hey, I've been having this argument with one of my friends and I need other people to weigh in. My friend and I are pretty much the same skill level (mid gold) but at the start of the season they spam ranked games without me and race to get to gold 4 (from silver 4). So when we start to duo it seems like most of our games are mid silvers since im silver 4 and hes gold 4. We always go on a huge spree and end up with around 60% win rate as I rise to gold. By the time ive gotten to gold hes kind of rode the low elo of me being in silver up to around gold 2. I've pointed it out to him that hes getting a high rank through playing through silver and he gets very mad and says thats not how the ranked system works. Can anyone please give an opinion on this?

Thanks!"

leagueoflegends,"This post will probably get lost in the storm of this sub, but I have to say this community is more toxic than I ever realized. It is almost unbearable to try and learn new champions or roles in normal games because the hate you get from both sides is ridiculous. Teammates flaming because they died, enemies flaming becuase they killed you. Not to mention the diamond rank smurfs that come into our games just to keep us hostage there while they try and farm penta kills. It’s disheartening and why I will probably stop playing this game. So please just remember you make people hate the game when you think you’re being funny."

Then they got rid of Nexus blitz and returning to aram was awful. BUT THEN they added bans and made it pretty bearable... Only for them to delete it.

Just disappointed these changes aren't going through. Nothing feels worse than seeing great changes and then in return, get it taken out of the game.

I am happy to see Riot looking into other game modes though. Props to that"

Ziggs specifically is in such rough shape. Every game doesn’t even matter if I do well. That cheese champ on the other team gets one sniff of a kill, they take out my whole team.
