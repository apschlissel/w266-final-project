wallstreetbets,"Earnings yield less than 1%. So the US Federal reserve is paying you 150% MORE on treasury bills before inflation and Chipotle doesn't even give their investors any of their earnings. Even if they were to double their profits (never heard of a restaurant being able to do this one quarter) perhaps a 10 billion market valuation would be valid, but 19.6 billion? 

Let alone the fact they were guiding to low single-digits comparable sales growth in Q1 2018 and in Q4 2018 they hit 6.1% comp thanks to their 3.3% price increase. All of a sudden they guide for 4-6% comparable sales for 2019? Thanks, Jay Powell for capitulating to Trump and giving casino stocks like Chipotle 40% stock price increase. 

Half of their earnings call is on ""digital sales"" - they don't talk about how much of their margin is taken by DoorDash and UberEats for delivery lol. Majority of their stores are in the US and they will have to pay people much more than minimum wage to get them to work for Chipotle. That was true last year and even more of a factor this year. They never talk about all the local burrito shops serving burritos for 20% cheaper prices INCLUDING Guacamole? Many of them have more options like Fish tacos I might add.  

I wonder how those comps will do with another ""modest"" price increase in 2019 and wage inflation continuing to be 4-5%? They also mention that they lost their tax deduction on giving free lunches to employees is now gone, and from what I recall the only benefit of working Chipotle is the free food. If they get stingy on that they'll have workers fleeing by the masses lol.

We'll have to see if they keep inflating their stock with guidance next earnings call at the end of the month. Don't understand why anyone would buy a stock for 108x earnings and NO DIVIDEND in sight when their GAAP earnings were flat in 2018 even with their menu price increases. For Amazon or another tech stock this valuation could be justified, but for a burrito shop? 

 There's literally no upside to the stock at 705 in this labour market. They spent over 50% of their profits on closing stores in 2018 yet they act like everything is all good and business is booming in their earning calls. Fake news?

I guess all it takes is a guidance boost to make 40% on your money, and that's how the insiders get rich by taking advantage of immigrants and the less well connected! Just ranting here, but I thank whoever's out there reading this.

wallstreetbets,"A month ago I started paper trading the Nasdaq 500 (NDX) to wet my toe in options trading.  Once a week I would buy on a dip one option, 30 points above the current strike, set to expire 1-1/2 - 2 weeks. I would sell any where from 50% - 100% profit. The trading was bitter/sweet. The bitter was I don't have the kind of money to do this in real life, but sweet that it was working. 

CBOE offers a mini  500 that is 1/10. The bid/ask ran about 10% higher than the NDX b/a. With the NDX I can trade every week,  but the MNX does not.  The next expiration is not until Dec '19. The last exp was 3/15/2019.

Does this index only come available twice a year or only if the CBOE decides to offer. I would like to get into trading MNX because it's more affordable to me. I've searched every where to find an explanation but found nothing specific to MNX. 

Thanks"

Firstly, on the way to school I pass by 4 Starbucks locations, not including the one in Target, and their drive thrus are always filled. Never have I seen a single car or two in 1 drive thru. There's usually at least 8 in 1 drive thru. To add, I have a handful of classmates who always come in with a large Starbucks coffee and even the professor. 

Second, kids as young as 4 years old are getting drinks for themselves. One day I saw a woman with 2 kids in Target and each had their own drink. Little kids are getting addicted. Anything to stop the kids from crying. 

Lastly, I'm all in.

So let me introduce you a little bit in the situation, I got a credit for 130 thousand bucs, and through 3 month I had only 35 000, read whole story in the first article.

What happened in March, ah. It was started from 30 000 dollars and peak was about 50 000 dollars, I have finished at 41 000, now for 03.04 my balance is 39 000, it was hard Monday and Thursday, today on Wednesday peak was about 3 hours later at 40 000 dollars, the markets are close now and I saved my Short Brent position from 68.80$ it close at 68.40 and low was 67.80 where I hesitated to close the position and started changing about 1.5 hours with my college in same time I loose good point to exit.

What I changed:
I recorded the day results by screening my phone screen with figures
I written down notes each week with position I have made, by putting info for each low, high and close price of the day, I mention all results.

What is I am teaching now
Close position when price go against the position through at least 2 hours
Look to the graph only for make decision, not for just carousing about what has happened, and when I see loosing position I just watching nothing to do

I hope you will enjoy my adventure to become market billionaire. Peace.

&gt; Levi Strauss &amp; Co. (NYSE: LEVI) will host a conference call to discuss the company’s financial results for the first quarter ended February 24, 2019. The call will be held on Tuesday, April 9 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time/4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and will be hosted by Chip Bergh, president and chief executive officer, and Harmit Singh, executive vice president and chief financial officer.

(I know many of you idiots are confused right now because you don't think about earnings until that calendar for the week ahead gets posted on Sunday and only then do you start circlejerking each other about earnings plays).

18 Oct 2019 ATM Straddle is ~$5.30 for an IV of ~41%. This is 197 DTE. 

I have started modeling and formatting the TTM financials for Q1 2019 (10-Q and 10-K needs to be pulled forward). I have a spreadsheet but not sure best way to share it or if anyone even wants of the data like this.

I am just curious. What is the overall opinion about US equities at their current levels? 3 years ago, people were laughing when somebody mentioned Dow 25k. Does technical or fundamental analysis actually work? We are quite close to the ATH on all US indexes. When you compare hard/soft data from September and now, the difference is huge. I am starting to believe that the only way to analyze the market is to take into consideration a few things:

Modern money mechanics , debt=money and money=debt. The only way to keep Capitalism alive is through money creation, that is clear.

So, if you`re betting against the US economy, you are virtually betting that Capitalism will vanish.


This boggles me a lot. People thought 2009 was the end. From the current point of view, 2009 was the best time to buy. Now, I believe a drop is what follows, but could there be a chance for DOW at 30k?

We have an event an hour before open tomorrow called job's report. Regardless of directional opinion, job's report is very important, and if it's optimistic I'm going to aspie trade tech as tech got killed today. I buy a range of expiry's depending on the trade I'm making. Tickers &amp; PTs:

ZS back to 70 &amp; above
CYBR to 120 May
OKTA to 90 late April
CRM 160 April 5/12 or 160 ER play
ZEN 85 April 12 or 85/90 ER play
AYX 85 April 18 
TTD 220 June/210 May 10 (day after ER, sell calls against this...)
HUBS 170 May
SHOP 200 April 12
NOW 250 April 26 for ER
MDB 150 May 3
ESTC 90 May/100 June
NTNX 40 (weekly gamma scalp)

I've been following these for a bit now and always trade what I know. I buy both long dated options, shares, weekly/monthlies, gamma scalp/delta neutral, and sperg FDs. I've been trading TTD AYX NTNX ZS this past two weeks &amp; will probably continue to do so. Too many tickers here to trade but all good ideas IMO. Thinking about making a bullish summer ESTC trade for after lockup expiration along with CRM OKTA NTNX. I currently own ZS CRM CYBR TTD ZEN AYX NTNX ESTC. 

Anyone else keeping their eyes on the tech drop today?

My question is about dividend investing and if it’s too good to be true. According to the website below with the default conservative numbers, if i save about 13k a month for 15yrs with dividend reinvestment, I’ll have about 4.7 million with 150k/yr dividends.

What’s the catch? And if you assume yield rates higher than 3.2, it explodes to 500k a yr, etc.

Can it be this simple to break into the millions? Im talking 10s of millions. What am i not seeing?

Since its cooler sister, marijuana, became legal for recreational use in Canada and many American states last year, industrial-use hemp—a variety of cannabis that contains trivial amounts of weed’s mind-altering substance, thc—is flourishing in a country that until a few years ago banned its cultivation outright and where cannabis traffickers can face the death penalty.

China grows nearly half the world’s legal hemp. In 2018 sales, mostly of textile fibre made from the plant’s stalk, totaled $1.2bn. Now global demand for its seeds, leaves and flowers is surging. Packed with fulsome fatty acids, seeds go into snacks and oil. Leaves and flowers contain cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound that reduces anxiety and inflammation. It is being added as a supplement to food, drinks and cosmetics across the West. In June America approved the first CBD medicine, for epilepsy.

China’s first licence to extract CBD went to Hanma Investment Group, owner of its largest hemp planter and processor, in January 2017. By next year, estimates New Frontier Data, a cannabis consultancy, Chinese sales of cbd will more than quadruple to $228m. Investors are rushing into the field. A Chinese hemp index tracked since 2018 by Wind Information, a data provider, has more than doubled in value this year. Shares in Shanghai Shunho New Materials Technology, a packaging firm, rose threefold after it received a licence to plant hemp in south-western Yunnan, the first province to lift a national ban in 2010. Shineco, a biotech company whose market capitalisation on New York’s Nasdaq exchange has nearly doubled to $25m since it unveiled a hemp subsidiary last month, plans China’s largest industrial-cannabis project in frosty Heilongjiang.

That north-eastern province became the second to legalise hemp-growing in 2017, issuing a three-year plan to become the biggest cannabis base in the world by 2020. In its inaugural year, Heilongjiang harvested 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of hemp—nearly one-third the size of European and Canadian fields combined. Neighboring Jilin province, too, will soon earn a licence.

Chinese growers are already setting their sights farther afield. In December America legalised industrial hemp nationwide for the first time since the second world war. Hanma ships more than half its domestic output there. Tan Xin, chairman of Hanma, says he will begin to grow and process hemp in Nevada later this year. American hemp has higher cbd levels than China permits.

On March 27th the anti-drugs squad declared that China had never approved industrial cannabis as a medical or food additive; the hemp index briefly drooped. Mr Tan expects China’s government to tighten monitoring, while gradually allowing wider application of the plant’s by-products. Factories in China are also closely monitored with cctv cameras and workers are subjected to daily urine tests. But Hanma has teamed up with the pla to develop a cbd-based drug to treat post-traumatic stress. That will be the next chapter in the plant’s long history in China. During the long years of the hemp ban Yunnan’s ethnic minorities continued in secret to harvest leaves, stalks and seeds. Today they can earn farmers 50,000 yuan ($7,400) per hectare, at least twice as much as corn."

wallstreetbets,"Hey what's happening r/wallstreetbets! Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 8th, 2019.

# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/first-quarter-earnings-are-expected-to-be-lousy-but-stock-market-may-not-care.html)**
*****
&gt; The worst earnings season in nearly three years is about to begin, but stock strategists say the market should be able to look right past declining profits and continue to reach for all-time highs, as long as trade talks between the U.S. and China continue to show progress.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, on the prospect that the trade talks would ultimately lead to a deal that could end punitive tariffs and boost earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2% for the week, at 2,892 and is just about 1.6% from its all-time high of 2,940, reached in September.
*****
&gt; Among the first major companies to report are J.P. Morgan Chaseand Wells Fargo, both on Friday. In addition to earnings, investors will be watching Wednesday for minutes from the last Fed meeting; CPI inflation data also on Wednesday; and any headlines on trade or the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" from the European Union.
*****
&gt; As for earnings, Refinitiv expects a 2.2% decline in first-quarter profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies, but those lower results are expected to be the trough. Earnings growth is projected to rebound to 2.8% in the second quarter and by as much as 9% in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter decline would be the first negative earnings period since the second quarter of 2016.
*****
&gt; ""The second, third and fourth quarter will show a rebound.That's supportive of higher equity prices,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. ""I was thinking I'd like to see a record for the whole year, and it looks like we might do better than that.""
*****
&gt; 'Picture much brighter'
Keon said there are risks, including whether there really is a trade deal with China over the next couple of weeks and whether China's economy is really bottoming. ""Is the success of China's stimulus gong to to continue and spread to other countries? To me, the picture is much brighter than it was a couple months ago,"" he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said any number of factors could be the catalyst to push stocks to records, including earnings season, if companies beat lowered guidance and their outlooks are good. Stocks could also ride higher on a better outlook for the U.S. economy, after a batch of better data including Friday's March jobs report.
*****
&gt; ""I think maybe we end up getting to a new high sometime early in the second quarter, and then maybe we do some sideways moving in that 'sell in May' period,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""I think we confirm that 10th anniversary of this bull market by hitting a new all-time high. Then we digest some of those gains and move sideways for a bit and let some of those earnings catch up, and then maybe there's a year-end advance.""
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, investors are watching for the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, scheduled to be released Wednesday afternoon. At that meeting, the Fed released revised forecasts, with no rate hikes now expected in 2019 and a slower growth outlook. The minutes should also show what Fed officials were considering when they decided to end the program to roll down their balance sheet, and bond traders are looking for clues on which type of Treasurys the Fed will hold in its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; On the data front, there are CPI consumer inflation data Wednesday and producer price inflation on Thursday. Both of these indexes should be closely watched since wage gains were muted in Friday's March jobs report, and strategists said they see no sign of inflation on the horizon. The Fed also sees below-trend inflation, so any unexpected change would be important.
*****
&gt; The U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union will continue to make headlines in the week ahead. The Council of the European Union meets Wednesday, and will consider the U.K.'s request to extend the Brexit deadline, originally this coming Friday.
*****
&gt; ""It could go in any number of directions. The thing we've been telling people is if it's a messy, hard Brexit, the big difference between now and three years ago is you'd get a big chunk of that safe haven flow into U.S. dollars,"" said Michael Schumacher, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said investors would be more inclined to move into the short end of the Treasury curve, rather than into German bunds, which have negative yields.

# Big First Quarter Gains Undoubtedly Bullish

&gt; Well the big gains of Q1 are in the books and after the nastiness in Q4 it’s reassuring to see the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle returning to form and delivering solid gains. The Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle runs from Q4 of the Midterm Election Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year for with an average gain of 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 over the 3-quarter span. The S&amp;P 500 gained 13.1% in 2019 Q1, but it lost 14.0% in 2018 Q4 and is still down -2.7% for the Sweet Spot so far.

&gt; But, nevertheless, this type of gain for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 is undoubtedly bullish. The S&amp;P 500’s gain for 2019 Q1 is the 26th best quarterly gain for the index since 1930, 7thbest Q1 since 1949, largest Q1 gain since 1998 and the top quarterly gain since September 2009.

&gt; As illustrated in the accompanying table the 44 prior times that the S&amp;P 500 was positive in Q1 since 1949 resulted in 40 full-year gains and 4 losses for an average gain of 16.2% and gains for the remaining 9 months of the year 38 times out of 44 year with an average gain of 8.6%. The 18 years with Q1 gains between 5.5% and 13.9% are all followed by full-year gains with the only blemish in geopolitically charged 1956.

&gt; The big black mark came from Black Monday 1987. 1956 was mired by the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet invasion as well as the Suez Crisis, the Second Arab-Israeli War. 2011 was hindered by the international sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the resulting downgrade of U.S. credit rating. The dotcom bubble popped in the year 2000. Tepid growth and earnings declines created a mini bear in 2015 that bottomed in February 2016. And finally, the 1980-1982 double-dip recessions put U.S. stocks in abear market throughout 1981 that ended in August 1982.

# The Bespoke Report -- Second Quarter Chart Checkup

&gt; Following big market moves like we have seen in the last six months, a number of market characteristics tend to change as some new leadership groups emerge and others fall by the wayside. In order to help get a better idea of what sectors and groups have been driving the market, in this week’s Bespoke Report, we are providing a ‘chart checkup’ of all the S&amp;P 500 Industries as well as providing updates to some key market and economic charts that we feel are important to highlight.

&gt; It was a banner week for US equities and a great encore to a strong first quarter. With the exception of the Dow (DIA), every major index ETF was up over 2%. Value outperformed growth across all three market caps, but the margin between the two was pretty narrow. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU) actually saw modest declines this week, while Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rallied over 3%. In international markets, China (ASHR) surged over 7%, while Mexico (EWW) bounced over 5%. Australia (EWA) was the only country up less than 1%. Fixed income ETFs saw modest declines across the board.

# Jobs Growth Slows, But Only A Little Bit

&gt; Today's job numbers beat expectations, with 196,000 jobs added and a small positive revision to the prior two months. On a rolling 3 month average, job creation fell to the lowest level in over a year, but only marginally. While jobs growth is still solid, it has cooled a bit. That isn't anything to worry about, but it is something to keep an eye on.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-1.png))**

&gt; Wage growth picked up dramatically last year, with 2016-2018's sideways movement in the year-over-year change of average wages paid surging. Over the last few months that growth has once again been moving sideways, albeit at a much higher rate of growth than we've seen for almost all of the current economic expansion.

WSB was right, and $PZZA did have a good spike after the news, going from $47 up past $53 at the end of last week. This week, they've been back on their usual downtrend, falling to $52.10 at close Friday, having touched as low as $50.50 Thursday afternoon. $PZZA's been on a general disappointing downtrend in the last year, and it's likely to continue. I take last week's sink in prices as indication that the spike was indeed excitement about Shaq, and that as it wears off the price should settle back down to where it was, around $50 or lower.

My position: I opened a short when the Shaq spike happened on the 22nd, but pulled the plug two days later when it became clear the surge wasn't over yet. Been waiting to see when/where the price would top, and I think last Friday was the tippy top. I'm considering opening another short position in $PZZA next week, depending on conditions Monday morning.

Straight outta college, I got a good gig as a sales trader for a boutique firm on wallst. We did secondary offerings for small caps and obv this would dilute the stock thus crushing the price. So i essentially knew exactly where the stock would drop too, cuz I had inside fuckin information. So while I was in college, a buddy and myself started this bullshit fund where it was initially a joke, but once it caught wind I was a trader, we gained more interest pulling in 30k from a few different investors (sure, not much money but YOU fuckin try and raise 30k from strangers). Anyways, I’d short the positions in this rat hole account and see my gaurenteed gains pop up 50% every single time. 

Eventually I got caught as we all do. I took the whole portfolio and shorted $TOPS a  week before the new issue. FUCKIN $TOPS ran 100% and I blew up the account. Everyone snitched and I got my license pulled.

If you haven't seen my posts in the daily or weekend threads, I've been working on creating a LSTM neural network in python to attempt to predict stock prices. I've had several messages asking about the script as well as I've noticed some comments in the weekend thread looking for some sort of TA thread were people can share plays and talk about strategies.

So I figured I'd make a post about my relatively new strategy and answer any questions as well as provide a place for people to critique/shit post my method if they so choose. 

Here are some predictions for tomorrow I made this morning- [https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v](https://imgur.com/a/j8SL88v)

Plays for tomorrow based off my forecasts:

1.  I like to combine my model's forecast with TA to form plays, and I see some TA to back up the models forecast for NVDA. [https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr](https://imgur.com/a/UP2QcKr). Bearish divergence on the hourly chart for both the AO and the RSI. If this play doesn't work out intraday I'm fine holding for several days. Looking for a mid day rally in NVDA with overbought RSI on 5 or 15 min charts for a entry into puts. However, If I see signs of slowing momentum early, I might pull the trigger in the first 30 min-1 hour. Probably looking at 5/17 190s.
2. See a similar story with AAPL, bearish divergence on the RSI, not as clear in the AO but we do have two red ticks at the end of the histogram. [https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ](https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ). Going back to my forecasts, I'll be looking to get in to some puts 15-30 minutes after open. Right now I have my eye on 5/17 195s. Same story with NVDA, if I don't get the move I'm looking for, perfectly happy holding as I see some signs of slowing momentum on the daily charts.

Feel free to comment your own TA, critique my model/TA, or just as questions. I've gotten a lot of helpful feedback about my model from the daily thread so looking forward to some more feedback. Important note, this model is still very young and I make no guarantees of it being bug free so take that into account when looking at the predictions.

I'd say 90% chance.

Another thing to keep in mind is tesla being tesla it could hype up AMD quite a bit even if the revenue from that IP is quite small.

I'm going to start by reiterating the same shit I said last week, except this week, I'm going to be a bit more cold hearted about it. When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.

# How My Picks Are Generated

These plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:

* Market cap of $5B+
* Daily volume of 1M+
* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.

# Results On Last Week's Picks

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.

**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.

**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.

**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019

**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.

* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**
   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.
* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**
   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.

&amp;#x200B;

**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.

* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**
   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.
* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**
   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.
* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**
   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Check out the last couple weeks of posts for the reasons. 

* **YOLO: 4/12 $35 calls @ $0.45**
   * If I decide to enter these, I'm going to be really attentive and micromanage the position, averaging down and potentially exiting if it goes against me.
* **Short term: 4/18 $35.5 calls @ $0.48**
   * Giving up .50 of strike spread and paying only a few bucks for it seems reasonable. I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.
* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**
   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh

&amp;#x200B;

**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop. They have piles of free cash flow, get a government contract every other week, and we've proven the $380 level to be pretty solid support. I imagine this claws it's way back to $400ish within a couple of weeks. For me, it's a true BTFD. I got lucky and cashed out debit spreads/calls on Friday morning so I didn't eat the downturn, either.

* **Short term: 4/18 $397.5 calls**
   * Probably micro managing these as well, just seems like they're so volatile there there could be a lot of building into the position/averaging the cost in order to see a solid profit here. I don't know the price because they gapped down like a mother fucker after hours on Friday.
* **Long term: 6/21 $450 calls @ $2.22**
   * This is the strike where it seems each $5 jump matters - these will likely be cheaper than listed, and offer a good chance. I don't plan on holding these until expiration unless the stock just explodes upward and I feel like I have enough cushion to sustain any bad news that may possibly come, although I still think the verdict is out and shit is priced in. I think the algo sell off on Friday will just rebound back up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I know this sub loves to hate this stock, but I don't really care about their underlying business model. They also announced some semi-cool tech that will keep the white girls on the app longer on weekends, and it still stands as the easiest way to set up a way to chat to your mistress. Because of this -- they will likely survive just fine, even at a loss. The user base has to be worth something.

* **ITM play: 4/12 $12 calls @ $0.26**
   * I'm considering getting long shares and this seems like a decent price to pay to be able to watch and wait and see what happens this week.
* **YOLO: 4/12 $12.50 calls @ $0.12 or $13 calls @ $0.06**
   * They really don't have to go that far for these to profit and if there's any week they MIGHT rally through the recent gains, it would be this one.
* **Long term: 5/24 $14 calls @ $0.44**
   * Most likely not holding these to expiration, unless I see the type of run I'm expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \- I didn't post this one last week, but I definitely benefited off their run on Thursday and walked into it by luck because I was about to liquidate my calls I had, and then noticed they were running really hard. I think that it's poised to keep running this week for multiple reasons and the options are dirt cheap based on a few factors.

* **Short term/YOLO: 4/18 $26 calls @ $0.39, 4/12 $25.5s @ $0.46 or 4/12 $26 @ $0.24**
   * If I go back in on any of these (I had $24.50's this week I sold on Thursday) then I'm going to monitor this stock closely. It's been consolidating like none other and could really be poised to gain some back, more importantly, the company is valued reasonable, trading at a decent ratio, and the options are pretty cheap.
* **Long term: 8/16 $30 calls @ $0.78**
   * If my thesis is right and I decide to go this route, I'm likely holding them and just accepting what happens for the next few months because if the stock at any point tacks on a significant amount, they could really skyrocket in value.

# My Current Project

I'm thinking of streaming a small account challenge 3 days a week (Tues, Weds, Thurs) on Twitch (1k-&gt;50k). I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.

# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look

**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)

**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)

# State of the Market

We're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.

# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks

Correlated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.

# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?

If you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. 

**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none

**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.

&amp;#x200B;

**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these. I got like four hundred last week? I trade during the day, so I can't be bothered to be responding thoughtfully when I have 15 charts on my screen.

wallstreetbets,"I have been researching and want to try a screener for adjusted slope 125/250 day but can't seem to find one.

""The Adjusted Slope 125/250d indicator is equal to the average annualized exponential regression slope, over the past 125 and 250 trading days, multiplied by the coefficient of determination (R2). This indicator is useful in helping find shares that have been on a consistent upward direction over the past six months to a year. Generally speaking, the higher the 125/250 value the better as this would indicate a consistent increase closely correlates to the actual stock price."" "

wallstreetbets,"In physics there is a concept known as quantum entanglement, whereby two particles are bound together by some fucking mystery force such that, even if both particles are light-years apart from one another, if you fuck with one particle, the other particle gets equally fucked.  Einstein referred to this phenomena as “spooky action at a distance”.  But as spooky as that may seem, you don’t need to be no particle physicist to see this.  Our shit is entangled as fuck, especially when it comes to money and politics.  And here’s an example of what can happen when we lose sight of the physical laws of money and politics.

This story starts with a dude by the name of HL Hunt.  Now right there you should be thinking, this must be one bad motherfucker.  He had two letters for a name. Fuck. But trust me, this dude is right up there with Livermore in the annals of American yolo aristocracy.  So much so that back in the day, even OG oil baller titans like Ghetty spoke reverently of the dude.

HL was born in 1889 in fuck-knows-where Illinois. He was home-schooled but a math prodigy and he was burning through college algebra by the fourth grade.  As a teenager, he gets bored with shit at home and heads off on some kinda old-school American walkabout to figure his shit out. After drifting for a while, at the age of 23, Hunt hustles his way into a gig running a cotton plantation in Arkansas.  But in 1912, the plantation gets flooded and destroyed, and HL is left a suitcase and $100.  So he does the responsible thing: he goes to New Orleans to gamble.  

Now, Hunt always loved to gamble.  As a kid, he would take a bet whenever he could and he used to sit in on local make-shift poker games, busting out hard-ass dust bowl men 4x his age.  And when he felt good about a bet, he went all-in. He didn’t know another way.  Because back then, in pre safe-space human resource America, if you left the shit still breathing, there was always another game. But what made HL special was that when he won, he took care of the people around him.  He was principled and shot straight and endeared trust.  People liked him.  And when you when you have virtuous shit like that going for you, people tell you all kinds of useful secrets.

So in New Orleans HL gambles his $100 into more than $100,000.  And being who he is, some friendly motherfucker tips him off to the fact that in Texas, ranchers are bitching about all this all this oil bubbling up through the dirt and fucking up their pastures.  So HL goes to El Dorado, Texas and spends his winnings buying his first oil rights.

And it turns out, that was a good idea.  And when the shit starts paying, he yolos the fuck out of his profits, buying oil rights far and wide.  And by the time of his death in 1974, HL owned majority rights to pretty much the entire East Texas Oil fields, at the time the largest known oil reserves in the world.  And he becomes rich as fuck.

But like all of us, HL had his issues. As a hard-ass self-made driller of shit, HL was hugely distrustful of the Federal government, with all their ivy leagues and committees and newspaper opinion pages.  What the fuck do they drill for in DC?  And as he got older, he became conspiratorial, believing the world was moving against him and he instilled in his two oldest boys, Nelson Bunker and and Lamar, a belief that to keep ahead of the men in the shadows, you gotta build real wealth, on shit like metal and crops and oil.

So all this is happening in the early 1970’s in America, which, except for punk rock, was a fucking shitty decade.  The post-war boom had long since fizzled and the US dollar was just not getting a lot of likes.  And after years of listening to all this kinda shit at the dinner table, the Hunt boys read the newspapers and see an oil crises and Vietnam and war in the middle-east and start to think, fuck, maybe he has a point.  Inflation (some ancient shit you may have read about) was like 14% and they had Nixon back in Washington saying shit like America no longer needs to back our money with gold.  That shit is old school.  We can just financial engineer our way out of this. Trust me. 

So in the early 70’s, because it was illegal in the US to invest in gold, the hunt brothers, all HL Texas paranoid and shit, decide to go all-in on the next best thing, the Litecoin of shiny metals: silver.

And they bought the fuck out of the shit.  But the thing is, times change.  The younger Hunts, after a few years getting to know commodity markets and once almost cornering soy beans, they realize: buying and storing tons of metal is expensive and unnecessary in this day and age.  Let’s just buy futures.  

And so they go all billionaire ape shit in the public commodity markets buying silver.  And for a while, that seemed smart as fuck because prices went through the fucking roof.  In 1970 when the hunt’s started buying silver, the spot price was $5/oz.  By 1979, the price was $55/oz. For a while there, for every dollar increase in the price of silver the Hunts realized a paper profit of $100m.  Fuck.

By 1979, the Hunt brothers came to own physical bullion and futures contracts equivalent to 77% of the world’s silver. 

But it turns out silver isn’t just shiny metal billionaire eye candy.  It’s also a raw material needed to make shit like film and transistors, and the makers of that shit employed a lot of voters.  And so you see where this is going.  Shit is entangled.  When spooky shit happens in Texas, it disturbs all kinds of quantum particles in Washington.  And because entanglement is a two way street, Washington responds. In February, 1980, the new Federal Reserve Chair, Paul Volker, gets with the big exchanges and together they introduce new rules that capped the size of future exposure to 3m ounces (the Hunts had over 40m).  Traders had a month to become compliant.  Additionally, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) suspended any new sliver future contracts.

And here’s what happened next: in March, 1980, in what became known as “Silver Tuesday”, silver drops to $10.80/oz.  Even with bunkers full of the shit, the paper losses on futures negate the Hunt’s bullion holdings and the Hunt brothers are fucked.

Bill Gates once observed that “private money can take risks in a way that government money often isn’t willing to”.  Which is 100% true right up to the point that your ass gets dragged before congress to explain the shit to the rule-makers.  The shit is entangled.  And that’s some quantum money shit you gotta be careful fucking around with.

wallstreetbets," (March 28, 2019) Warren [\#Buffett](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Buffett) said that the country’s economic growth has slowed of late. As he said, “That doesn’t change anything we do. If there was a flashing red light, if there was a blaring red light, we would keep investing the same way we do.” 

Buffett’s comments come on the heels of Thursday’s report that U.S. economic growth slowed sharply during the fourth quarter of 2018, with GDP dipping to just 2.2 percent growth. The number was revised down from previous estimates of 2.6 percent growth, mostly due to fading government stimulus from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and rising trade tensions.

wallstreetbets,"Hi, I'm new to investing, and from what I found online, it seems like the safest thing to do is to start off with indexes, but I have some money to spare and don't mind a the risk (like a lot of ppl on this sub). I've compiled a pros and cons list to decide which stock is a better choice to invest in:

Aurora Cannabis

Pros:
• 2nd largest weed company in revenue 
• Has 11 growing facilities
• Ability to produce 500k kilos of marijuana per yr
• Operates in 24 countries (large global presence)
• Holds 9 acquisitions (primary source of growth)
• Activist Investor Nelson Peltz has been named strategic advisor to Aurora Cannabis Inc.'s board to help with global expansion ambitions

Cons: 
• Paid for many acquisitions with shares of stocks, warrants, convertible notes, and options (1 bn outstanding shares) --&gt; low earnings per share 
• Has no partners while its competitors do
• Overpaying for their acquisition transactions
• Extract and per gram prices dropping annually

Canopy Growth 

Pros: 
• Largest producer of Weed/revenue for weed companies 
• In Canada, Canopy has signed a deal with each of the country's 10 provinces and has an agreement with the Yukon territory
• Operates in 11 countries 
• Holds 8 acquisitions
• Is partnered with Constellation, which owns alcoholic brands, such as Modello and Corona 

Cons:
• Canopy's share count is up to 75%, and with 107.9 million warrants as well as 31.6 million stock options, there's a good likelihood of a much higher outstanding share count in the future --&gt; lower earnings per share
• Dried cannabis flower is susceptible to per gram price decreases over time
• Overpaying for their acquisition transactions 

Given this information, it's clear that Canopy Growth is on the safer side. Though both companies will grow with time, I want to know what price I should purchase shares at. Rn Canopy Growth is at $43.24 and Aurora Cannabis is at $9.17. I'm leaning more towards buying shares of Aurora Cannabis over Canopy Growth, as I feel like there is more room for growth despite a higher risk, should I?

Question: What price should I consider investing in Canopy Growth or Aurora Cannabis? Canopy Growth is at $43.24 and Aurora Cannabis is at $9.17 rn. Also, if you have purchased either stock please explain why you chose one over the other thx. :)

BTW I was relocated to a Sunday thread at r/weedstocks. This probably isn't the right place for me, but I came for a larger audience."

wallstreetbets,So I've been searching for posts about stock screeners in this subreddit and all the ones I found are for computers. I'm looking for a screener for android. In reality its handy to build a watch list with a portable device instead of sitting for hours on a desk in front of a screen. Does anyone here know a screener for android ? Why isn't anyone talking about them ? Is it like there isn't any out there ?

I was going to write some sarcastic bs about how the tards on this sub love to flock to the meme stocks but I'll take the high road. I know, I know, I'm so respectful. You're welcome for not being patronizing/self-aggrandizing. /s

TUFN is yet another Israeli (also Boston) cyber security IPO that's coming this Thursday, April 11. I'm going to be watching this IPO for a nice entry point as it looks like an IPO that's flying under the radar &amp; is priced very conservatively. Keep in mind cyber security is a market with TONS of competition &amp; I believe TUFN's growth rate has slowed. 

Do your own research but here's some financial info:

84M TTM Rev, growing &gt;30% y/y
71M Gross Profit, 84% gross margins
73M OpEx
~4.2M Net Loss/3M EBIT Loss. 

The IPO midpoint priced at $13/share on ~32.5M shares which is ~423M market cap. That's a TTM 5 p/s or assuming 30% FY '19 top line growth (FY '19 revenues of 109M) a p/s of 3.9. Growth apparently is slowing right now so I'm simply watching this and hoping it sells off and there's a little liquidity in options after a couple weeks. Regardless a very conservative valuation. Also watching PagerDuty (PD) but it's valued at a 14.5 TTM P/S which seems extremely high for an IPO in a crowded space."

wallstreetbets,"less versed in company fundamentals, but here is argument for DIS calls.

Would love to hear some opposition to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming Platform:

Investor day is Thursday, April 11th. This should increase volatility regardless of what they are showing, but it happens to be all but confirmed that they will be showcasing Disney+ streaming platform.

Now, this is not entirely revolutionary platform as they already have established ESPN+, but it provides strategic advantage to DIS as it will hold existing as well as potential content that competitors such as Apple, Netflix, CBS, etc cannot. And yes they have already announced plans to remove their existing content from Netflix. Personally, I have no idea why they are not presenting unified platform with all content or even piping all these services through Hulu (which they own majority stake in), but I suspect this is a future play for them.

Based on AAPL announcement, stock rose 8% (month of March alone) and is continuing to go up (\~12%). Apples compelling argument is bundling service packages. No content specific buzz that I am aware of as of now.

&amp;#x200B;

EndGame (movie):

Right off the bat, Avengers Endgame is already crushing records on presales and managed to cause outages on Fandango and AMC sites. I wasn't versed in how stock reacts to movie releases so I just looked at stock reaction after their major blockbusters released just to see if their is any correlation. I am choosing highest grossing blockbusters as my assumption is EndGame will easily fit in that category. I'd like to normalize numbers in a way that includes hype up to move as I believe a lot of the times stock price reacts well before movie is release, but this is what I'm going with for now.

**Movie/Gross Earnings/Release Date/$DIS Stock Movement 2 Weeks After Release**

* Star Wars Force Awakens / $247,966,675 / 12.18.15 / (-1%)
* Black Panther / $202,003,951 / 2.16.18 / (+1%)
* Avengers: Infinity War / $257,698,183 / 4.27.18 / (+3%)
* Marvel's The Avengers / $207,438,708 / 5.4.12 / (+3%)
* Star Wars The Last Jedi / $220,009,584 / 12.15.17 / (+3%)
* Incredibles 2 / $182,687,905 / 6.15.18 / (+1%)

Based on numbers, there is a slight lift. Not completely significant, but again my expectation is that End Game blows these records out of water. That and the combined news of streaming should move stock up significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple things to call out that I have not researched as much:

* Park revenue: have not even looked into this in anyway
* Q1 Guidance from DIS: they have already said Q1 earnings (May 8(?)) will be lower as they plan to invest in streaming platform
* Movie net revenue: though I expect the new EndGame movie to crush gross income record, I also know they are floating around a $500M cost of making this one and the last one. Will probably look into net profit as an indicator next.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know thoughts on this and anything else you think I should look into for analysis.

Either way, I have no idea why stock is staying flat. Would love insight there."

wallstreetbets,How I avoided $LYFT
wallstreetbets,"The news broke today that New Age Beverages partnered with Walmart to get 3 of their drinks on the shelves and be sold. Being a follower of NBEV for a while (to play the pot hype) I assumed the deal was for their CBD Marley drinks. I'm sure I wasn't alone in this. 

  
However I did some more research and it's not for their CBD drinks. It's just their healthy-alternative drink options. I can't see any justifiable way for a stock to boost 40% for healthier drinks. I think the news was delivered sketchily, and most people believe it was their CBD drinks and bought in to the hype. As anyone who has followed NBEV would know, this stock runs and dies on hype around their CBD Marley drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the stock could still run more due to people FOMOing in and shorts covering. But this stock was already in a steady decline from the huge bubble that formed on it back in Sept '18, and everyone knows its overvalued (but we all wanted to play on the pot hype). Well this news isn't about the pot hype. It's about ""healthy drinks"". This is America, we don't care about health, goddamn it! This stock is going to crash back to $5 or below without any news on their CDB drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - NBEV is running on fake hype and I believe a nice put/short play = free tendies"

You will act surprised when there's a potato shortage in the US this year and you will act surprised again when there's mass starvation a few years later.

You aren't aware 2020 is scheduled to have a massive economic rejuvenation even though *everybody* in the know has been trying to tell you for at least the past 10-15 years that I've been a conscious mind.

You can't do basic evaluation of a share price and just make completely random guesses of where LYFT should be when it's a brand-new stock that couldn't be simpler to analyze. 

Most of you failed to get into AMD at under $2.00 when it was the most obvious buy in the past 10 years. That's not an isolated example, most of you miss or ignore everything. Most *millionaires and billionaires* who make *millions and billions of dollars* on their trading somehow missed this too, but they can afford to be retarded so maybe they're retarded by choice, you guys cannot afford it and so clearly aren't doing it by choice.

The average lemming has an insanely strong addiction to pretending nobody is better than them, and I hate the average lemming, so I just like giving a reminder whenever I can of the fact that I'm better than you. That is all."

wallstreetbets,"Serious question here

So, a few months back I bought ten $105 strike  7/19 calls. This morning when i opened robinhood, it was showing a $4,000 dollar increase for about 30 minutes. When I went to view the other bids, I was notified that they could be closed but not bought, and the options were renamed to NVS1. 

After a quick search it looks like there was an offering of ALC to Novartis holders. 10 ALC calls are now in my account and are identical. Can someone explain the spike this morning (seeing that option buys were halted) and maybe give some insight as to what this means?  Good news? Ok news? Bad news? 

Here is a link that may help explain what I am holding

Please help me understand stock pricing. I know that the price of a stock decreases with more selling, but isn’t there just as much buying of those sold shares? I’m confused how a share being sold makes the price go down when someone else buys. Pls help.

wallstreetbets,"In Ray Dalio's new book Big Debt Crisis, he starts off talking about  long term debt cycles, and there are so many parallels with the market crash of 1937 and today. 

The book was released not too long ago, but it was before this 20% market rally from the drop of death. I won't get too into it, the book is free on PDF, anyways he talks about debt and how the fed raises rates in the late 1930's and the market freaks out. Then the fed comes out and stops raising rates, calming the market. People buy again because earnings on companies are still good. Market rallies just over 15%. Earnings come out really bad because of the debt cycle and everything. Market drops roughly 50% after the pre-earnings rally. Super low growth for about the next 15 years, from the low of the 50% drop. 

Earnings season just begun boys. Bet short and hold on tight (still use a stop loss). Due to liquidity this market is likely to go down, even if everyone sees it coming."

wallstreetbets,"I'd say we're due earlier because of how insane valuations are, how increasingly debt ridden consumers and corporations are, and how balls deep into this cycle we are, but one thing keeps me mid-short term bullish. 

Interest rates are still low as shit and the Fed has stopped barking. When that happens the ONLY place for people to park money for a healthy return is the stock market. Papa Buffett has said this countless times; interest rates act as weights on equities.  When kept low with no barking to the contrary, the stock market will be fine in the near-longterm. 

But eventually all good things come to an end and the Fed has telegraphed that they're wanting to increase rates over time. Thing is, they'll have to if they're smart, because if we can't cut rates the next time we have a real recession, there's no backup parachute. You just have to pray to god your main one (further quantitative easing) doesn't fail with inflation or ineffectiveness.

Now onto the Bernie effect. I'm not a very political person. Politics in general is aids and I hate it. If you're a Democrat, fine, even Nancy Pelosi yolos options from time to time. If you're a Republican, fine, both parties have some good points. That being said, if Bernie makes it to the general don't underestimate the stupidity of the masses. I could see him being elected easily. It's not PC to say, but Florida just added a crap load of former felons to its voter roles, and if you can flip Florida then you're already over half way there, and that's just one state. 

I don't care what side of the aisle you're on, Bernie will WRECK the market. Wall Street does not like one thing above all else UNCERTAINTY. Rich fat fucks and managers will look at how late we are in the cycle, look at who just got elected and say ""fuck this"" at massive rates and sell hand over fist. Who knows how far Bernie will go in taxing corporations, if he'll tax dividends at a higher rate, not to mention the special taxes sought on HFT and short term trades.. Uncertainty will eat the market alive and it'll shit the bed. 

I'm not saying Bernie is bad. Frankly, I admire the guy in some ways. But one thing I DO know, is that mf'er will wreck the market. 

TLDR: Low interest rates keep economy/market sluggishly chugging for awhile, if Bernie wins market shits the bed hard, even if he loses still probably gonna shit the bed to a lesser extent.

wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to get a blog going, and two of the things I wanted to use to make it financially viable were referral links for Robinhood and Acorns. I am perhaps dumber than a box of rocks when it comes to investing (GE will rise again!), but I'm not trying to give financial advising; I'm trying to get people to sign up using my referral link (let's be honest). I really like the service, so I'm shilling for it in the article. I was just hoping to get some input before I accidentally say or do something stupid or unethical. Here's the article:

&amp;#x200B;

I started using Robinhood to buy stocks back in October of 2018. I love it.

Robinhood is easy to use; once you're set up, you can make informed trades in a snap. There are a ton apps out there that force you to spend hours filling out surveys and signing up for services so that you can make some pocket change while you're in the waiting room at the doctor's office, but these things are impractical because the payout is minuscule and the labor is mentally intensive and exhausting. Investing through Robinhood is far more practical than something like Swagbucks or the hundreds of similar ""free money"" apps. I've burned a few hours on those. Be smart and don't waste your time with them.

I'm not a financial advisor or a guru, I'm just a layman who uses this service enjoys it. The idea is simple; buy low and sell high, or just buy low and save up for retirement. You can do either of these with Robinhood; the app lets you set limit orders, so if a stock you want drops down to a certain level, your order will automatically purchase it or if it rises to a certain value, your order will sell it.

With investing, the more you have, the more you make. Robinhood is a great way to get started because you can throw money into at anytime. If you sign up using our link, you get a free stock. If your friends sign up using your link, you both get a free stock. You really do help the writer of this article out by signing up, but you also help yourself by training your mind to enjoy setting aside money for the future. Saving is smart, so start being smart with Robinhood. If buying individual stocks isn't up your alley, then I recommend Acorns (links to another article).

Join Robinhood and we'll both get a stock for free. Make sure you use my link. (link)

Thank you, friend! Hope I've helped!

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

teenagers,"I mean you go to school for like 6-7 hours a day, plus bands, sports and extra classes. When you consider travel time, depending on where you live could be upwards of 1 hour each way. This adds up to 8 hours or so for myself, and I walk 5 mins to school. 

They have unrealistic expectations of students. They want us to sleep 9 hours a night, leaving 7 or so hours for everything else. 

You are given mandatory homework and if you don't do homework, you are forced to stay after school, taking up even more time. For senior students this adds up to 3 hours plus, along with study for tests and exams. 

When you are at school, depending on your teachers, you may not talk, have to ask to go the bathroom, get a drink and all these other basic needs. 

They treat us like children but expect us to be making huge decisions like choosing subjects for university or trades that can and will decide our entire life for some people. They trust us to drive and control a 2 ton piece of metal going at 100 km/h (at least for older teens) but not to go to the bathroom. Wtf

On top of this they somehow expect us to have motivation to study and work hard despite not seeing any nearby pay-off. We constantly get told we will thank ourselves later, but have not once seen the pay-off for studying, other than scholarships which only a few get anyway. 

You got burnt out after 10 weeks of the year and have to continue this for the next 10 months? Good job, you pass into the next grade. You finish school with a good mark because you worked your ass off? Congrats, you can go into university for another 3+ years of study. And, you get to pay $100,000+ for that privilege, great.

On top of the stress of doing well in school, teenagers have so many other new, big things to deal with. Generally, teenagers are expected to

- Learn to drive
- Get their first real job
- Have their first 'real' relationship
- Have active social lives

All while facing the challenges of puberty and the confidence issues associated with that and fitting in.

The epidemic of mental illness is also heavily ignored or brushed off by schools. 

To be fair, I don't blame teachers. Most of them are genuinely nice people, and don't get the recognition or pay they deserve. I am also grateful fo the holidays we get, they are pretty generous.

I just think the school system and idea of how schools function is very exploiting of students (?) and needs to change.

As a side note, I know heaps of really talented athletes, musicians and academics who have the potential to do great, but are just burnt out by school and don't see any incentive for their effort.

TDLR: Schools take up too much time, expect too much from us. They treat us like kids (asking to go to the bathroom, get a drink) but expect us to make huge decisions about our futures. We also have to deal with heaps of other stressful things like first jobs, driving, relationships and it is too much. The last 3 paragraphs are pretty short already  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

teenagers,"hi pls help i’m hurt :-( even though idk you

basically my “best friend” started talking shit about me two days ago when i wasn’t
around in school. now he ditched me for another clique and kinda made others hate me. i’ve to sit alone in classes &amp; lectures &amp; be alone, making people ‘hate’ and bully me for that. it’s either i stay alone or join cliques in my class. my class is very cliquish and everyone has their own clique already. you can consider me without one as my ex- best friend “betrayed” me. i got quite a bit of friends outside of class but inside
my class i got no close friends. he also kinda made the whole class hate me by criticising me while i wasn’t in school. it’s hurtful but i need to get out of this situation quick. 

tl; dr: got ditched by my best friend, what should i do? stay alone or join random cliques in my class. 

typical highschool drama/
bully but it’s very hurtful

i haven’t added in the bullying part but it’s basically after he joined the clique. the whole clique started hating on me and throwing shade. but i have a year and a half with them. and i’m alone. 

and sometimes i join the other cliques i don’t even talk bc i can’t fit in them. i’m friends with them but i’m simply not close to them. some of them don’t appreciate my presence either. like they’ve got close friends in their cliques already. it sucks that almost everyone in the class dislikes me. 

i just feel like shit and i want to transfer but it feels so impossible now. everyone’s in a clique except for me :-( + the bullying doesn’t help. especially when my best friend left me.

i’m coping well in terms of academics but then these issues will affect me and i don’t want that to happen :-(

my only solutions: (only applies in class)

1) join other cliques and try as hard as possible to fit in although it may still fail as i’m ‘new’ and some of them dislike me

2) continue to hang out with the original clique who talk shit and in front and behind of my back (???? with my ex friend of course) 

3) be alone and fear people’s judgement in school :-( 

basically i have close friends outside of class but not in class and it sucks."
teenagers,"This took me forever to figure out so I hope you guys like it despite the fact that literally no one asked 

So, here's the equation:

(2s)(sps)(60)(std)(ms)
______________________
           5280(12)

It definitely makes no sense yet, so let me explain the variables:

**s** : this stands for stroke length. This should be the number of inches you move your hand up or down while stroking your shaft. This has nothing to do with the length of your penis, just how far you move your hand. The number will probably be somewhere between 1-5 inches.

**sps** : strokes per second. This is one that's difficult to calculate exactly but you can just take a general guess by moving your hands at about the same speed you do while jerking off. This number will probably be like 2-5 times a second.

**std** : session time daily. The abbreviation doesn't make too much sense but I really wanted to use std as an abbreviation. This is how many minutes you spend on average jerking off each time. This could be anywhere from like 5-60 minutes.

**ms** : masturbation sessions. This is probably the hardest number to figure out if you want to find the total number of times you've ever masturbated. To do this, take the average number of times you masturbate per day, and multiply it by the number of days since you've started masturbating. For instance, if you're 16 and have been masturbating for 4 years every other day, you can find this number by multiplying (0.5)(4)(365).

So let me use an example for the whole equation. Let's say my stroke length is ~3 inches, strokes per second is 4, session time is ~15 minutes, and I've masturbated daily for 3 years. If I plug in all those numbers, then I can figure out that woah, I've jerked off my hand a whole 373 miles!

Now begins the contest of who's jerked off the farthest!"

Sorry for posting this here but I have no one to really tell."
teenagers,"hey , does anyone want to play some minecraft in like 2 hours. comment on this post and i will make a chat with all of us

teenagers,"I have this best friend (since second grade. Almost in eighth now) and the more that I think about the more I realize that I'd be just fine without her being my friend. I do this with all my friends. Of course I would be a little sad, but honestly, it feels like I cold care less if she stopped being my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that concerns me is my kind of want to feel pain. I've read somewhere that pain can release endorphins and that's why? I don't think it's a serious issue since the only things I can handle are scratching at my skin, pick at scabs that are not ready, smack my face when I think stuff I'm too innocent to want to think of, and picking my lips.

&amp;#x200B;

My lip picking is real bad. I've been at it for about a year and a half now. My lips are naturally super chap and I can't carry around chap stick all day without losing it. So when I feel a piece of flaked up skin on my lips, whether it's chap, scabbed, or fresh, It's natural for me to pick at it which often leads to scarred, bleeding, and sensitive lips. The worst part is, even when there isn't flaked skin, I still go up to my lips and see if I can find one.

&amp;#x200B;

My school work also doesn't bother me as much as it used to. K5-6th grades if I got an 82, I'd be upset and nervous about it. How bad it would be if I got a 79. If I had just missed one question (I'm an AB honor roll student). Now I look at a 73 and be like ""It'll only bring my grade down three points. I'll have a 78 in Science. I'll just do extra credit.....laTER,""

&amp;#x200B;

  
A lot of other things have changed as well. I used to get upset when I got in trouble (i.e., not doing my chores), but now it feels like it doesn't matter. My smirk stands strong in those kind of situations and my nervousness is at a minimum. I've even started to like watching disgusting things (pimple popping, lipoma removal, popping blood blisters, the removal of thick calluses) and they don't affect me at all. I can watch them when I eat and stuff and not lose my appetite.

&amp;#x200B;

I also scratch at my skin, pick at scabs that are not ready, smack my face when I think stuff I'm too innocent to want to think of.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only been like this for a week (I think, I have bad sense of time. Two days can feel like a week to me), but I'd like to know that it's just hormones and not any mental issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I think about it, I have been trying this new exercise thing where I do thirty squats a day. I've been doing this for the past week. There's no exact time at when I do them, but that's when these things started changing. I've also been eating less in order to lose weight (F - 5'3/230 lbs), but not starving myself. I'll stop eating when I get full and not try to finish the plate and/or eat for taste. It's hard for my family because trying to lose weight can sometimes make you feel belittled even though nobody really cares. Like you're embarrassed to workout when people know. Also, our food is full of fats and salt and everything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't use the scale I have or count calories because

1.) I truly, honestly, don't give a damn about the numbers

2.) If I don't see changes after the first three days I get unmotivated

3.) I'll tend to be seen annoying if I ask for all these healthy foods that are expensive and won't feed the family for the week and it doesn't seem worth it to cause drama in a household with three moody teenagers especially since they love to pick on each other for every little thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, tell me your thoughts. Tell me I'm being crazy or stupid. Or it's just phase. I would love it if you told me it's just a phase because I really can't stand my brain right now."

teenagers,"I’ve fled my hometown, changed my number and stolen a 2018 Ford Fiesta, but nothing seems to be working. I uninstalled the Duolingo app 5 days ago, but I still get the notifications demanding me to learn Spanish. On the third day, I heard a window downstairs break and found a brick on the floor. There was a note tied to it saying,”Your time is almost up. Learn the fucking mexican words or else”. I don’t have the work ethic to dedicate the effort to learn the language, and just accepted my fate. But the next day, when I found the brakes in my car removed after causing a minor accident at a nearby intersection, I realized that I’m afraid to die. In that very moment, I received another notification saying,“It’s too late for practice now. Speak the Spanish all you want, I will make sure of tu muerte”. I then turned around to see what I swear was a mass of neon green feathers dart behind a tree. I did not sleep that night, and I’m thankful for it. A few hours after I went to bed, the owl appeared in my window, but quickly fled after I drew my firearm from my nightstand. That’s when I decided it was time to leave, and later stole a car parked down my street. But I know that my fate is sealed. Because every second I’m not running, he’s only getting closer. The notifications from the deleted duolingo app have been getting progressively darker and more sinister. The last one didn’t even ask me to practice learning my language. It was just the owl asserting to me that he is God. I know I’ll die soon. I’ve accepted it. Yet I’m still upset that my life has to end because of my inability to learn Spanish."

teenagers,"Ok so, recently my teachers have been giving us days upon days of homework, now I hate homework and I do it most the time but nowadays I just can't push myself to do it. When I'm at home I've tried just going to my room and pulling it out and working on it but I just can't, I go to school, pull it out when I have time, and i just can't do it I don't know why. My grades are fucked like I'm not kidding I'm at the lowest of low I have ever been and I just can't push myself to fix it. Anyone else go this issue?"
teenagers,"Honestly i just graduated from high school last month and i feel so relieved,

God i remember when i was like 8 or 9 being so excited for high school because i watched the high school musical movies on Disney( those movies are really cringy rewatching them now)

i was a pretty quiet kid when i first got into first year and not very good at socializing, i ended up pretty getting ostracized and bullied with few friends, which led me to binge eat a lot which led to gaining weight which led to more bullying, coupled with overbearing parent who expected me to get high grades, but kept getting mediocre grades, that has led me to gain a deep sense of self-loathing on myself.

It was only since last year that i have started improving, I've lost weight, gotten a better grades, and made closer friends since then, and get even a little bit of self-esteem, i even managed to get ask a girl to the prom and she accepted!!, (me from a few years ago would never have even tried)

So while there are a few moments i admit i would miss and that i am intimidated the responsibilities of being an actual adult, I'm just glad that i can finally start to be independent away from my parents who i still love but i need to distance from right now."

teenagers,"These have become very inconsistent, and i think ill just use the format ever few days/weeks. Shits happened in the last few weeks. I got a girlfriend. my parents have started being way more controlling than before. Spring break is in 3 days.  
1 Well, i got a girlfriend. and she makes me very happy. Im not going to go far into details, but she's really great for me, and i enjoy spending time with her.  
2 My parents have started cracking down on me. more than before. the cameras in my room are now active, and unlike before, i cant get away with covering them anymore, as my dad walks in my room to uncover them. Both parents have started taking my phone from me at 8:00 every night, like im 8 years old again. I know as a fact that my mom is trying to get into my discord, and has banned me from using app locks. So ive had to remove discord and reddit from my main phone, and have to re-download and sign in every morning. Its getting hard to spend time with friends or my girlfriend. Also, im technically not supposed to have a gf until after i graduate college

3 my girlfriend's birthday is on friday, and she's invited me and a bunch of her friends to the movies. i managed to convince my dad to let me go, because it will be a large group of people. HOWEVER, cuz im socially retarded, i dont know what to get my gf for a gift. so if you have any ideas, i kinda need some. It'll be a fun night i think, as long as my parents dont get in my way.   
4 fuck english.  its a bunch of ""intellectuals"" jerking off around meaning that is implyed and forced. this is coming from a honars class kid, who currently has a 98% in the class. Fuck english. at this point, we're just bullshitting meaning.

At first it was just one kid, but then I saw a girl wearing one. Then there was a kid wearing the same sweater, except it was My Little Pony. The hentai on the sweater is very easy to notice, even if you don't know what hentai is, you would probably think that sweater is not appropriate for school. I don't think any of those kids have gotten caught, they wear them everyday and a teacher never notices. Like I said, it's very obvious that it's hentai, no nudity, but just the faces. I can't believe that the teachers have never noticed, it's crazy. I would show a picture, but I don't have any. Just search up hentai sweater and you'll find the sweater I'm taking about. Also, I think the kid with the My Little Pony hentai sweater made it himself. I couldn't find it on Google."

I told my friend, shes been my best friend for a while, and she totally thought I was trying to get nudes from her and I had no intention to do so because I'm an ok person. Anyway I talked to her about it and yeah I did say some stuff I shouldnt have and I said some mean things (for therecord I didn't call her any gender directed words), but that's because she made me so mad that she thought I'd do something like that and she accused me of almost cheating on my girlfriend when I would never ever in a millions years cheat on her, we even got to 5 months just yesterday, and she told a couple people about it but from what I heard she made me look like the bad guy when I had no intention nor did I realize what was going on. I still want to be friends with her, but at the same time shes making it hard to do that and honestly I'm doubting if I want to be friends with her. I'm barely holding it together and I just need some advice to get through."

(Side note: You want to talk to the 14 year old guy who you’ve been harassing all semester about being mature? What a fucking joke!)

GT:- I am quickly losing respect for you!

So yeah. That’s why I’m mad and wondering. This useless asshole wants me to care about his respect. Please, I will never respect a Gym teacher who treats me unfairly because I don’t try or have breasts. I say that because I know numerous male Gym teachers that just let girls do what ever they want. Even now, one girl spent the entirety of a week and half just standing in one place every game. He does NOTHING about it. 

i am so fucking done with Gym. Im not doing a damn thing til the end of the semester. Not giving a good goddamn about how much respect I’m losing."

teenagers,"So I’m in a group chat with a bunch of my friends, crush and best friend plus his gf. People are chatting as usual when my best friend decides to take a text message conversation between us out of context to put me down and put himself up. I’ve often suspected him as being toxic but never thought he’d stoop to such a low unprovoked. The chat he posted was from last year and I went through our entire chat history to find the context and prove him wrong. Now you may be thinking: what’s the big deal he forgot to add context? But I pointed it out before finding evidence and he flat out denied it, labeled me a bully and as mean. 
(The chat in question took place on a day of a guest speaker who had no limbs and their struggles and how to cope with mental health, really inspiring guy tbh. Our convo went like this:
J: have you seen the guy at school today
Me (on bus assuming it’s just a new kid and try to wind up my friend): yeah he’s really fat huh
J: wdym he just skated past me
Me: fat joke + 4)

It was relatively innocent with no malicious intentions but when taken out of context it looks cruel and harsh, so no need to do that in front of my new friends and my crush, who I know hasn’t seen the chat yet but def will in the morning.

He then, insisting I was mean posts screenshots of the one time I insulted some kid in a grade below me. And yes I was a dick, but again it was last year and I’ve grown to be better and I respect the guy cause he’s actually really nice.
Anyway i compared the kid to the green goblin and I can’t defend it because I was being a dick at the time. I didn’t bully him tho, it was always an inside joke between me and the one friend. 
Not to mention my friend was encouraging of the behaviour and made similar comparisons between ourselves. However in the screenshot he is seen saying “you’re so mean” at the bottom, this paints a scene of me cruelly bullying some poor kid for no reason and J as a mature person who scolds me for it. Which he is far from, even for a racist, hypocritical, narcissistic, body shaming twat who resolves every problem with violence that he is. 
In context he is often making racial comparisons and remarks about the native people, the aborigines. He can be attention seeking in that if he does something better than another person then he’ll snap up the chance to point it out. He body shames for the slightest bit of fat/chubiness and compares it to his own flat stomach, this does not motivate me the way he seems to think it should.

I feel sorry for his girlfriend because she’s a really nice person and doesn’t actually know him as well as I do it seems. This will keep up because, and I do feel sympathetic, that he won’t talk to her. He claims he does but from all I’ve seen is an awkward hello every so often.

Getting back to the group chat, I’m especially mad about him doing it in the chat my crush is in, something he knows by the way. I am hoping to ask her out today or tomorrow because then it’s the holidays and I was really hoping to hang out during them and I don’t want to ask her over messages.


I just want your opinion one if I should ditch my “best friend” and if he’s really even that toxic or am I over reacting. Idk, I’m really mad and he insinuated he was gonna hit me this morning by I couldn’t care less, he’s a dick and as of now or until I get advice isn’t worth my time."

teenagers,"Over the last few months I have been working on a web app for my school that allows students to see a countdown until class is over and the current schedule, among other things. I hope to eventually turn this into a free service that students and schools can use to access the latest schedule changes (assemblies, snow days .etc) directly from their school's administration.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my school seems to love it and use it constantly, I was wondering if students from other schools would also be interested in using this at their school.

&amp;#x200B;

The [landing page](https://classclock.app/?pk_campaign=reddit&amp;pk_kwd=post1) has some more information about the app itself, including a couple screenshots, links to social media profiles and a form where you can enter your email address to receive a notification when the app is ready to use at your school."

I put a dollar in the machine and it accepted it, so i went to put a quarter in the machine (the drinks are $1.25) but the quarter got stuck. i spent a couple minutes trying to jiggle the coin out, but it didn’t work, so i gave up and decided to just put another dollar in the machine

I tried the first dollar in my wallet, and the machine rejected it, which wasn’t really surprising, but every other dollar i tried got rejected. the machine finally took one of my dollars BUT IT STILL SAID I ONLY HAD 1 DOLLAR. i kept trying the rest of my singles (i had $17) and none of them worked

luckily the coin return button worked so i got one of my two dollars back, but i’m still pretty mad

They have been insulting me by saying that the universities give admission to anyone who pays and I have no talent as I didn't get any financial aid. The aid over their is based entirely on finances of the family and my parents make way more money than the aid guidelines. (I'm not bragging about their money this is a real problem for me.) My brother who barely passed year 7 (With a warning) was given a playstation and a new macbook so clearly my parents aren't hiding any financial crisis. They are expecting me to get a bursary at a residential college at uni in australia but I'm a 100% sure that isn't going to be offered to me. Everytime they just insult me for being not able to secure a scholarship and give me examples of the kids who did it but never mention anything about finances. Many of the the aid packages they are expecting are purely based on financial need and I've gotten pretty much all the scholarships I could. They expect some sort of a miracle that I can attend one of the country's most expensive universities for free. I have no idea to what I should I do. I already missed one semester and I could go in the second one but my parents aren't willing to pay anything.

I have maybe a useless post here but it’s my first one and I maybe need a bit help of y’all.
So, I’m totally in love with a boy. I’m a 14 year old girl and he’s 15 and good looking as heck. We know each other from sports (judo). He’s always very nice to me and we talk and chat a lot. We talk about school, private stuff like the family and older relationships. We are I think good friends and I can tell him everything. We trust each other but in my case there’s more than just friendship for me. I fell in love with him but I can’t tell him bc I’m afraid he won’t talk with me how we used to do. And that would break my heart. I thought some of you maybe can relate or help me. I don’t know what to do right now. I feel uncomfortable because I can’t tell him the truth and it makes me suffering even more than my life in normal does. (Depression, family, school and grades😥) maybe some of y’all can help me in this case and if you need a bit more infos feel free to text me.

teenagers,"I can't explain it honestly. I've seen lots of girls about and never really thought much of it, just people you see once and then move on. But she was different. Most people would probably just ignore it but I took one look at her and... I actually couldn't look away. I just forgot everything and looked... and kept looking. 

She was going to the mall same as me so I went the same way as she did. I swear it was like I was floating down the road. Again, nothing else on my mind but her. How could one person be so absolutely stunning? Everything about her was just so perfect. Even now, I'm almost shaking just thinking about her. 

I've never met her before in my life and, for all I know, I never will again. I don't know or even care if she browses Reddit, I just had to say this because I'd never actually seen perfection before now and I just had to tell someone... somewhere. I've never been a believer in love at first sight but... damn this was something.

But it got me thinking... how many guys see a girl and think they're the most perfect person ever without them ever even knowing it? How many girls see a guy once and think there's nobody better without them ever knowing? Maybe it happens all around me all the time without me even knowing. 

As a guy who's hit 18 without having even coming to dating anyone because of M A S S I V E A W K W A R D N E S S, it gives me hope that maybe somebody out there has felt the same way about me without there being any way of me knowing. But I keep believing that it can't happen to me because of how relentlessly negative I am about myself. And I'm not the only one...

So the point I'm really clumsily trying to make is that a lot of guys are just as nervous as any of you girls and we need as much support as you do. Because maybe when we see ourselves as just as perfect and beautiful as the girl that I saw earlier, then we won't have to be standing on the sidelines awkwardly pretending everything is ok and we can be what we want to be. So always say something nice to the guys nobody talks to because they're the ones who need you the most..."

Around 6 months ago, he gave me co-ownership of the channel. Together we made a Fortnite parody of Mo Bamba (yes, it was ironic). It got 22k views and we gained about 100 or so subs from it. It may seem small, but it meant a lot to us. Today, he told me the account had disappeared. As bummed about it as I am, he is pretty sad because not only had he upload 50 or so videos on it, most of which he doesn't have saved anymore, it was personal account to. We didn't violate any community guidelines either.

My parents are still married but there is definitely no romance. They sleep in different rooms and are often fighting in front of me. I guess the reason why they havent divorced is cause there would be too much work and they dont have time so if they will it will probably happen when I move out.

What's worse is I'm all alone in it both of my brothers are off to university so they don't have to deal with any of it.

It's not like I want them to divorce it would be too much stress on me with moving out and stuff. I dont know how it is to have divorced parents but all my friends who have, have gotten used to it... I have to suffer through it daily so imo its worse.

teenagers,"Have you ever noticed that the girls in anime series about teenage girls never reference periods at all? There is never even a single hint at them being a thing in any way. Not even a discreet nod. I get that anime production is extremely regulated by investor/market demands so they have to keep it as appealing as possible, and I'm sure various manga series don't hold back in incorporating this topic in depth. Nevertheless, depictions of, and references to sex, vomit, snot, piss and even shit sometimes (although it's always just discreetly referenced as a need) abound. Periods don't seem to be even acknowledged as a concept. But am I even right about this? Have I just not watched enough of those teenage girl anime, and there's one where they do?"

i have a crush on a girl for now 4 months but without even know her. She goes to my school and I saw her all the time. For me, she would look perfect and she is a little bit of a nerd and I find that cute. Some friends of me know her well and I didn't know what to do, so I told a friend of mine that i have a crush on her that he could me. 
he found out she had some relations with a boy but I just thought fuck it, i just wait until it's clear that she's in a relationship or not. 

then I had an idea to just go to her with my friend ( so that I have I reason to be there ) and say hello or something to learn how she is. I couldnt say a fucking word. I was like frozen. I didnt show it ( i hope i didnt ) and just stood there. we quickly walked away as my friend realised that i was like frozen.

I’ve lived in Michigan all my life. Everything is bundled together, and there’s frankly a lot of nothing. I’d like to travel, see places.

As of now, I’m not really a city person. Well, I’m not a fan of Detroit, but you all know what that’s like. I’ve been researching colleges and lifestyle in NYC to see if it’s the place for me.

People with full time jobs, what’s that like? I’m going to get a job this summer alongside my license/permit. 

Now my homies over in NYC, how is it? I understand it’ll likely change in the next few years. 

TL;DR I’m looking towards the future towards NYC, I’d like some feedback of experiences and city life before I delve too deep into this."

teenagers,"So on April fool's day, a couple of people in my class decided to post some stuff on the walls in the bathrooms, [specifically posters they found online] (https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/441/965/a43.jpg), with a default skin from fortnite saying ""it's not cuul to juul in schuul. 

Of course, I'm fine with this, and make one of my own as a joke. Everyone is having a good time, laughing it up, until we get a call from the office about the posters. Apparently they found them and are looking into who put them up.

Now we're keeping it cool, not really doing anything, but eventually they check the security cameras, and find out who posted them. Those guys get called down to the office, and we're all kind of worried, because a call from the office is almost never good.

One of them comes back ten minutes later, and he tells us that the administration wanted them to make even more. Not just those posters, but they wanted them to create their own, along with the originals.

Sounds good so far? Here's where the jebait comes in.

teenagers,"I'm not really sure where this goes, but I'm posting it here to get it off my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my sophomore year, I dated this one guy who we'll call Joe. Joe was a sweet guy in the beginning. He was everything I could've wanted. I had told him about previous instances where a man had assaulted me, and he was understanding. His friends, however, would keep trying to make us have sex. I wasn't super sure, and I now regret it, but we had sex. I wanted his friends to stop being mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents found out and because he was 16 and I was 14, my dad threatened to press charges. He cut me out of his life, and because my friends were his friends, they left me too. I was completely alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a suicide attempt. I was hospitalized for 8 days and was out of school for almost 2 months. When I was in recovery, he was the only person to talk to me. I confronted him about him being rude to me, calling me names and shit, so he broke up with me over text, saying that he needed time to think and that he still loved me. When I got back to school, he wanted to continue. I was okay with it because we had talked about how break-ups should go and we agreed honesty, no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course when I return to school, he’s in our “spot.”

&amp;#x200B;

Making out with a freshman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was heartbroken. I couldn’t stop crying. The rest of my sophomore year was a living hell, as I had classes with him. I had to drop my favorite class because being near him made me panic. 

&amp;#x200B;

FF to April-May of our sophomore year. I learn that he’s gotten in trouble with the school for child pornography on his school computer. He sent nudes on the school’s computer. I was so happy, finally getting a taste of karma. Little did I know, this was only the appetizer.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I’m in my US history class. I had gotten over him somewhat (I still can’t look in the mirror, but that’s not solely because of him). My friend turned around and asked me about him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He hadn’t been at school lately, so she wanted to know why. She asked his friends, and the answer made my day.  

&amp;#x200B;

He was with a freshman (btw, he is 17-18, the girl is 13-14. I was 14 at the time as well). They had been caught having sex on school property. He was either suspended or expelled, but since it’s been a month since anyone’s seen him, it’s most likely the latter. He now has to go to court because what he did is considered rape in my state. He may be on the sex offender registry for life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it’s pretty shitty for him, and I shouldn’t be this happy, but he ruined music for me. I was a singer, making it to chorus on the national level, and now I can’t listen to choral music or even think about it without panicking. My momma always told me karma was real, and I doubted her at points, but, shit, this is a pretty strong argument.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A guy fucked me up for life, but karma cam in and now he may be put on the sex offender registry for life.  If there's a better sub for this, let me know."

teenagers,"I'm a high school grad from australia and I've recently got into some really good colleges locally and abroad. I've secured merit based scholarships but many aid packages are purely based on financial and living conditions. My parents know that they don't qualify to get any need based aid/bursary. Still, they have been insulting me by claiming that I have no talent/Didn't work hard and universities only offered me admission for the fee.  I was ranked one of the top students at my school (It's really competitive). My parents expect that they don't have to pay anything for my college. 

&amp;#x200B;

They clearly don't have any hidden financial issues and I've seen their asset documentation (Used for aid profile) and it's way over the aid guidelines. They have clearly told me that they won't pay anything and that anyone can secure grades like I have, while they gave me examples of other kids (They all hav good grades but been given full aid due to their family constraints). My brother barely passed 7th year and was promoted with a warning but he still got a playstation, Macbook and a trip he asked for. I have no idea what should I do. My uncle knows this and has offered to finance my college education but I feel really ashamed of asking him for money while my parent's bank account won't even be scratched my the money I need. I can't even make an issue out of it as my parents have a really good image and my anyone else in family won't ever believe me. My uncle also has a daughter going to college and in return he has asked me to get her into the uni I'm going to (Which I can't guarantee). Does anyone knows what I can do? My dad was given some money by my grandfather specifically for my college education a few years ago when he passed away. But my dad says that the money has been spent in my school fee and other expenses. Can I claim even a part of it somehow?"

teenagers,"You could say this belongs in r/relationshipadvice,but I felt like posting it here would be more fitting.

So a small introduction first: 

I'm 16/M, from the point of friendship I get along with girls fairly well,but I've always been really shy and never dared to try anything more serious (add to that the personal insecurities I've had and my dad's disability and you kinda get the idea why). Up to this point my romantic experiences consisted of unreachable one-sided crushes. However,in the past few days I've experienced a sudden self-esteem boost and oh,how convenient,crushed as hard as it gets,so instead of letting the chances go to waste,I've decided to step out of my comfort zone and get the wheels turning.


*WARNING,THE FOLLOWING IS CHEESY AS HELL*


So,let's start with the issue here,over the past 3 days since my self-esteem skyrocketed,I've crushed on 2 girls simultaneously (I'll refer to them as Jane and Jill for the sake of simplicity from now on),and lo and behold,I didn't even pay attention to them untill now. I'm eager to approach any of them,but I can't make up my mind. Jane's hellishly cute,I really mean it,aaand that's about it,I know nothing more about her though I would like to,before I decide who to approach. Jill is a really nice girl overall,I know a bit more about her and I know she's a genuinely good person,her friend knows that I have a crush on her and says that she's eager to help me.

 So,today I started gathering some more info on Jane from her classmates and friends,specifically from a friend of mine who's in the same class with her. His opinion is that Jane's a bit ""generic"" and not as good of person as she seems to be. But my Romeo ass somehow unconciously fails to accept that. In my defense,it's only one person's opinion and I think I should still learn a bit more about her and not write her off after one opinion (either that or she's got me so hooked with the looks). The point is that I subconciously know that I still won't be able to accept any negative opinions. So I'm basically in a loop,either choose a potentially bland,rebelious but devilishly cute girl that I'm fond of to the extent of being unable to see her bad side. Or choose a genuinely good girl (but not as cute) which could make it really worthwhile. To the people reading,the chouce would be obvious,but I'm so fond of them both that I'm unable to choose even with pros and cons in plain sight,I hope someone understands that,and is willing to help me solve this mess.

Thanks in advance!"

Like I’m a pretty right wing guy, so I partially sympathize with all you dudes non stop honking and shitposting, but I also still wanna talk about other things like music and nostalgia and other Gen Z-ish topics. I just feel like there’s way too many political posts, regardless of the belief, that’s all."

GenZ,"Tldr at the bottom. 

Before you use this sub you need to understand the difference between someone being serious and someone making a edgy joke.  

Eg. Someone says ""Hitler wasn't that bad"" 

99.9999% of the time they're making a edgy joke and they're not serious. 

 and you need to accept that's going to happen .  this is the internet .   

And Edgy jokes are part of this generation whether you like it or not.    

Also if a sub is making content you don't like ( e.g edgy jokes ) . 

 then here's a idea .. DON'T USE THAT SUB . 

 Just because a sub offends you doesn't mean it has to be banned .  Just dont use that sub . 

I enjoy edgy jokes so why should I not get to see my preferred content because you think every sub has to suit you and your ideology . 

Tldr : if you don't like this sub and its content  don't use this sub.  quit complaining about it just don't use it.  Just because it doesn't suit you doesn't mean you need to bitch about it or try to get it banned."

So here's how they groom a sub for takeover:

- first you need mods that are absent and naive (check)  
- next you flood the sub with seemingly innocuous posts:  
    - [Are you lonely? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bb9rni/are_you_lonely/)  - CringeAnarch User  
    - [I like my subreddit moderators like I like my central governments](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbauwd/i_like_my_subreddit_moderators_like_i_like_my/)  - un: EthicalEugenicist  
    - [Fren dont turn me off i am stuck in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbkty0/fren_dont_turn_me_off_i_am_stuck_in_here/)  - deleted all comments  
    - [How do all of you feel about Jordan Peterson.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbnzzr/how_do_all_of_you_feel_about_jordan_peterson/)  
    - [Been lurking Voat for awhile. Pretty promising, highly recommend it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbld82/voat/)  - cringeAnarchy user
    - [When 70 year old guy posts better memes than entire millennial generation (James Woods)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbl3q6/when_70_year_old_guy_posts_better_memes_than/)

- Next you flood the comment sections and downvote anyone trying to pushback:
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbmm91/is_anyone_elses_friend_groups_going_trans_all_of/  
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/basxw4/a_political_opinion_i_think_most_of_you_will/  

- A little concernt rolling:
    - [GenZ is the beginning of the comeback](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbmohw/genz_is_the_beginning_of_the_comeback/)
    - [r/GENZ IS BEING HIJACKED BY THE ALT-RIGHT, THEY PRESSURED MY SON INTO UNORTHODOX LEGO BUILDING TECHNIQUES](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bblm1l/here_genz_have_some_secret_cia_files_dont_tell/ekjy71b/)
    - [Regardless of your political side i'm loving that both sides are free to speak their opinions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbogqe/regardless_of_your_political_side_im_loving_that/)  

And top it off by a relentless posting/commenting schedule where the ones fighting back give up.

Worst part is watching it happen in real time and seeing how naive and clueless the people being affected by this crap are.  

I've watched this happen on reddit since day one and that it still happens is seriously depressing.

All past this point is the stuff I, /u/sirmrgnome, has found just from like an hour of looking.

User /u/thenukadweller admitting on CringeAnarchy they are attempting a takeover. ""[r/genz will capitulate eventually unless we send in more CA divisions. r/basedgenz as a backup supply camp](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/baz9m3/i_wonder_who_is_trying_to_infiltrate_rgenz/ekfuakr/?context=3)""

User /u/litovcas1 who currently has the top post here saying ""[They are looking for mods, someone with clear background should apply. We need to have someone inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bbsye0/it_finally_happened_bois/eklqvdc/)""

Posts about this sub being pushed to the [top of CringeAnarchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/baz9m3/i_wonder_who_is_trying_to_infiltrate_rgenz/) which will bring in more trolls. I mean, seriously who complains about people not wanting fascists here? The only way you get upset about that is if you are one.

Several of the current applicants for mods are in fact Cringe Anarchy regulars are very doubtful they are Gen Z.

 /u/cplKarp (a cringe anarchy and The_Donald regular) concern trolling about us not wanting the alt-right to brigade us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbvrxp/this_car_belongs_to_the_people_trying_to_stop/).

User /u/PillowDan posting a ""meme"" about 1488 which is a number related to Nazis. 14 being a dogwhistle for the saying ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children"" and 88 being alt-right slang for Heil Hitler. I also find it funny here [they are trying](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/bbv8n5/can_yall_be_real_for_a_fucking_minute/eklqnn4/?context=3) to convince us that Gen Z is in fact an alt-right generation.

I'm sure I could find more very easily but I need to get some sleep."
GenZ,"So, lately I've been interacting more with Gen Z people as they become adults. I was talking to my little bros girlfriend and what blew my mind was how casually she would block people on social media. If she was mad at someone she would just block them for a couple days then unblock when she was ready to talk to them again. Would regularly defriend people on facebook and re-add them later, that sort of thing. When I asked why she did this she'd say ""Well lol they didn't want to talk to me now so I blocked them"". And she also said this is something a lot of her friends did too. 

Is this really how it is or is she just nuts?

Only reason I ask is because as a millenial approaching 30 yr old boomer status this is inconceivable. Sure people block people but it's usually only if someone is harassing you or constantly sending you messages after you've asked them to stop. Aside from harassment I really don't understand this phenomenon. In like 10 years on facebook there's only been 2 or 3 people I've blocked and it was for deeply offensive reasons (they insulted my family etc). 

So yeah, is this sort of thing normal, and if so, why?"

Recently a subreddit (community) was created around the topic of Generation Z or Zoomers, since the subreddits inception it has been caught in a deep ideological struggle between the left and the right.

Each subreddit leans in moderation one way politically regardless of moderation, generally this is to the left, and right wing subreddits are incredibly sparse. There used to be a few bastions of the right on reddit up until last year where the head moderators of reddit essentially purged them all by lethal force. The head subreddit of this left leaning inquisition is r/againsthatesubreddits which calls for the banning and censorship of any subreddit or user who promotes what they often inaccurately deem “hate”. while also eagerly showing their bias by leaving communist subreddits alone to call for the “genocide” of the capitalist class.

This brings us finally to the topic of r/genz a subreddit with naught but 7 thousand members, while the sub itself is small… what it represents is beyond measure.  

r/genz is a staggering example of what the actual teenagers think when not forced into self censorship by overzealous moderators. Its home to anarchists, socialists, civ-nats, conservatives, libertarians, and all kinds of ideologies all living in harmony. A large base of the users are “rightfugee” teenagers escaped from the right wing purge.  

This attracted the attention of one of the last remaining right wing subreddit… r/Cringeanarchy a bastion of ironic humour and edgy right wing memes. Teens from this subreddit flocked to r/genz to find a place where they could speak about the true issues of genz without fear of the removal of content that may not fit the politically correct narrative.

A few days later this caught the eye of r/againsthatesubreddits who began to attempt to take over the subreddit and sanitise it like the rest of reddit. Suddenly the once peaceful subreddit is thrust into an ideological battle, the left of reddit and the right of reddit, duking it out for one small piece of the internet.

At the current stage the subreddit is continuing its protection of the freedoms of the subreddit and libertarian leftists are joining hands with the right in defense of free expression.

While the outcome is undecided it is an interesting footnote in the history of the war for reddit and the greater history of the ideological struggle for the internet.

All in all hail Zoomers of all stripes"
GenZ,"You’re literally trying to contort the youngest generation into thinking they’re alt right monsters when they like memes and hate boomers like you.

Now fuck off."

HOWEVER; if someone put their finger in the circle and it got grabbed the one who grabbed it still got to punch them.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has a counter argument, or counter statistics, please do provide them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage all reading this to look further into more sources rather than taking my word on all of these. I have provided sources to everything at the bottom of this post.

Also, this is *really* long. So if you want my opinionated TL;DR, scroll down to the bottom of this post.

# PEW RESEARCH CENTER:

**According to multiple sources from the Pew Research Center, these are the opinions of Gen Z:**

&amp;#x200B;

Generation Z is second only to Millenials in their distaste for Trump, with 70% of Gen Z not approving of Trump vs Millennials' 71%

&amp;#x200B;

70% *(The highest percentage of any generation in history)* say the government should do more to solve problems, which, in the context of the USA, is a leftist position.

&amp;#x200B;

62% of Gen Z believe that increasing racial/ethnic diversity is beneficial for society - *the highest percentage of any generation.*

&amp;#x200B;

96% say that interracial marriage is either beneficial to society, or doesn't make a difference. Only 4% say that interracial marriage is bad for society - far less of a margin than Cringe Anarchy will have you believe.

&amp;#x200B;

85% believe that LGBT relationships are (51%) beneficial to society or (43%) makes no difference in society. 58% are comfortable with using preferred pronouns for LGBT people.

&amp;#x200B;

67% think more women should run for office.

&amp;#x200B;

# FTI CONSULTING RESEARCH FINDINGS:

**According to a study from FTI Consulting, these are the opinions of Gen Z:**

&amp;#x200B;

73% believe everyone should have the right to marry regardless of sexual orientation.

&amp;#x200B;

74% believe transgenders should have equal rights.

&amp;#x200B;

64% support a free healthcare plan.

&amp;#x200B;

And even the most divided issue *still* has a liberal tilt; 55% of Gen Z believe regardless of the country of origin, everyone should have the right to citizenship. 

# THE CENTER FOR GENERATIONAL KINETICS:

**According to multiple studies from the Center for Generational Kinetics, these are the opinions of Gen Z:**

&amp;#x200B;

67% believe that the issue of racial/gender discrimination in the workforce is a true problem.

&amp;#x200B;

46% aren't concerned about illegal immigration - up 16% from older generations.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One other side note I want to add is that yes, Gen Z is significantly more frugal than past generations. But - it is disingenuous to conflate fiscal *frugality* with fiscal *conservatism* at least in a governmental sense.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Contrary to what some users on here will have you believe, the notion that Generation Z is somehow more conservative than other generations couldn't be further from the truth - and I have the statistics to prove it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22, and I've literally never dated a girl amd still am a virgin. I've gone on 2 dates, but they turned out to be only wanting sex or short term which isn't what I'm into. I want to do it with someone I'm serious with.

At any cost, this has really been messing with my head—All my close friends are in a good relationship, or have had at least a few AND they aren't old virgins like me. I go to uni, and graduate in less than a year. As much as I want to ask out other girls, my physical fitness isn't at its best. I'm 5 foot 9 213lb, have been hitting the gym since 263lb last year. 

I do fine socially! Good, supportive friends and great at talking to people. But I can't stop thinking of the fact that I don't have someone in my life to share thoughts, cuddle, spend time with, etc. I have hobbies keeping me busy, but still man—that thought bothers me that I never had someone and probably never will at this rate esp after I graduate.

While people were playing the next Black Ops, I was making my own TF2 maps and playing CS with some of my friends.

Take every COD game, for instance. They have very linear singleplayer levels, no complex mechanics whatsoever, and have dominated the FPS market. Every FPS game which came out of that generation was made to fit the COD formula, which sucked.

Now, I don't see this being much of a problem. I remember games like Skyrim had little complexity and games like Battlefield were watered down to be more BC like, but now you have games like Red Dead 2 and Prey coming out with really complex gameplay. Not to mention, semi-hardcore shooters like Insurgency and maybe even Battlefield V."

GenZ,"When I was like 8 years old I remember that there was plenty of various subcultures around.. or at least it was my impression. That may had to do with my sister and cousins having clique friends where a lot of folks belonged to certain subcultures. But still, it seemed to me that there was bigger presence of certain youth subcultures among teenagers which were metal, rock,  grunge, rasta, scene, goth, emo, punks and even some hippie reminiscents.

Today, I see only fuckboys listening to mainstream hip-hop and pop music, while all the subcultures are pretty much gone.  It's prety dull. We need some new youth movements tbh.. like brownshirts or some shit. You know, just for some good action and memories after people become adults."
GenZ,"Cars fucking suck. Like, I don't know why I even own one. These things are expensive as shit and break down all the time. And for what? Cozy transportation? Fuck that, I don't have 500$ to spend a month on this thing.

Now, I inherited my car. I was lucky, or not depending on your point of view. But lets get down to insurance, gas, and repairs.

Insurance is 300$ a month for this piece of shit because boomers want to believe ""haHAAAA ur young your car is a bumper car XD"" because they were too retarded to drive responsibly when they were young, so that must mean I'm as retarded as they were. Thats right. This is discrimination, and soon the boomers will pay.

Then you got gas. I work two jobs and I can still barely afford this shit. I'm spending something like 40-60$ a week just to keep this thing filled. And I need it to get to work, which ironically I then spend on gas. It's rigged I tell you.

Then there are repairs. The piece of shit I drive is a 2012 ford focus. I had to replace the transmission at 20k miles. Thankfully it was still under warranty or I'd be out something like 2 grand. Then you got tires. I've replaced all of them twice, each one costing 110$~ each. That's another 800$ I'll never see again.

But you see, I'm not whining. Whining is complaining without proposing a solution. Here's my plan:

Get a moped.

These ultralight boner magnets don't require insurance (at least in something like 26 states, even then it'll be cheap as fuck compared to a car), get almost 100 miles to the gallon, and cost anywhere between 800$ to 3,000$. Let's do the math.

Say you get a Yamaha moped for 3 grand, right? That's 3 followed by 3 zeros for you poor fucks in common core.

Compare that to the yearly cost of owning a car, specifically my car.

300$ in insurance, 200$ in gas a month. 500$ a month, times 12. You could buy 2 of these bastards a year compared to owning a shitty 4 wheel vehicle that's just gonna break down.

But lets say you get the cheap option and get a mf'ing Tao Tao moped for 800$. You could get like 7 of these fuckers a year compared to owning a car. Shit's cheap as fuck and can be ordered off amazon whats not to love?

The only downside is that you can only go 30 mph (in my state at least) without having to have insurance. But whats better, spending 6k a year on a car or taking a little extra time to get to your destination?

""Aww but wait /u/glorious_jo, someone is gonna make fun of me for having a moped!"" Wipe away your tears with your fat stacks of cash boi, cause that poverty ridden anklet is gonna drive himself into debt with his dumb 1998 ford truck like the asshole he is.

Both of these subreddits, in my opinion, have corrupted this subreddit and turned it into a recruiting ground for their goons. There's CringeAnarchy, which I can't support because they're against my kind and actively say terrible shit about my people, not to mention they're horrible (Which is why they're quarantined, plenty of better right leaning subreddits anyways), and then there's Against Hate Subreddits, which acts like it's righteous and is heavily condescending towards the people it 'pretends' to support. Both subreddits are a cancer to this one and must be effectively purged by the mods before it's too late. But that goes on to my next problem, the mods.

Both of the mods have their fucking thumbs up their ass and do nothing to quell the problem. You have one who just deletes random shit, puts up a moderator post and never really comes back, not to mention he's a fucking TF2 bot so that's not going to help. The second one just doesn't exist, probably killed themselves and just 'exists' because nobody redditrequested his ass, and that's it. They'll probably just randomly pick some dude to moderate the subreddit and It'll be a CA dude who just turns this place into another CringeAnarchy

Instead of vowing to get off the subreddit we have people actively masquerading as Zoomers who are really just Boomers - they say they'll leave us alone but they just use this as their leverage against ASH to put them on a higher pedestal. And they never leave because they actively keep putting out this narrative that they're better but it's really just a guise to get you on their subreddit - which is shit by the way /r/Cringetopia is the godly alternative.

And then you have the liberal fuckers who talk about 'brainwashing' young people into becoming right wing, they're like the fucking US in Iraq they do jack shit and just make 50 terrorist groups which are like the 500 CA splinters whose only existence is because of them - not to mention they're extremely 'self-righteous' and believe that they're here to save us.

GenZ,"I'm taking a break from the starter/ender pack this week, so instead, I'm going to reminisce a network that was beloved by several Disney cartoon fans, but very underrated and underappreciated at the same time, known as Toon Disney. 

&amp;#x200B;

As most of us know, the 00's wasn't really a good decade for Disney animated movies with very few exceptions like Lilo &amp; Stitch or The Emperor's New Groove. The 00's decade for Disney is mostly remembered for THE SKY IS FALLING lmao. The 00's was a weird transition from the traditional 2-D animation to 3-D CGI, so it was a mixed bag. The 00's decade for kid movies was about Pixar and Dreamworks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, despite all of this, I'm sure a lot of us grew up with VHS tapes of the old Disney movies from the Silver Age (1950-1959), Bronze Age (1970-1988), and Renaissance era (1989-1999). Toon Disney was basically a network for all of those, but with many TV shows based off those movies such as Tale Spin, Chip n' Dale, Timon &amp; Pumbaa, 101 Dalmatians, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, The Legend of Tarzan, New Adventures of Winnie The Pooh, and so forth, all from the 90's Disney Afternoon era, and there were also many animated shows from Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy as well, such as the classic Mickey Mouse cartoons, House of Mouse, Goof Troop, Ducktales, Darkwing Duck, Gargoyles, and so forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Toon Disney even had syndicated shows like the old Sonic The Hedgehog, Madeline, and Gummi Bears. You also had ABC/One Saturday Morning era shows like Recess, Pepper Ann, Disney's Doug, House of Mouse, Teamo Supremo, Sabrina The Teenage Witch (the cartoon), Mary Kate and Ashley, Buzz Light Year (the cartoon), The Weekenders, Fillmore, and so forth. Then of course, on Fridays nights there was a movie block for all of those classic animated movies from all the ages including Pixar ones as well, and Toon Disney had blocks too, like Magical World of Toons, Princess Power Hour, Hangin' With the Heroes, and Chillin with the Villains. 

&amp;#x200B;

Toon Disney was probably the most underrated network for kids. Toon Disney was basically Disney's version of Cartoon Network when it was in its prime. No one ever talked about this like Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, or Disney Channel. Toon Disney was like Disney World in front of your TV screen for kids, before you went to Disney World. Toon Disney had many good commercials for kids that were advertised well just like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, and they had a pretty dope website as well with all these games from the TV shows that aired. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mainly watched Toon Disney between 2002 and 2004. That era was my favorite. I didn't watch it much during the 1998-2001 era but that looked pretty cool too, and I know friends I mine who was watching Toon Disney since they were in preschool. Toon Disney, unlike Nick or CN, had shows you could watch since the preschool age that were non-educational, because Disney characters were iconic and light hearted enough. Age 2-11 was Toon Disney's main target audience (no I'm serious, it started with 2, not 6). 

&amp;#x200B;

Jetix on the other hand was targeted towards 7 &amp; up, and speaking of Jetix, that's what Toon Disney was all about from 2005 up until the end of the station in 2009 when Disney XD took over. Toon Disney was kinda pointless by the time Jetix started taking over 80% of the schedule or more. However, when Jetix first launched in February 2004 it was only a weeknight block from 8pm up until midnight and it didn't take up that much space its first year. It should have stayed like that, but Jetix had many fresh new action shows along with many old action shows, which is why it was more successful. Toon Disney just played reruns over and over, and a network reliant on reruns can't last forever. Thanks to Jetix, many classic shows were taken off the air with few exceptions while Toon Disney started airing current Disney Channel shows that could already be seen on Disney Channel itself. This was the beginning of the end for Toon Disney, and the network only got worse from there unfortunately. Jetix was great overall though, i'm not knocking that block over.

GenZ,"So as some might know I listen to alot of older synthpop from the late 70s  / early 80s combined with early dadaist-inspired Industrial. While not many people not listen to this from our generation, the reason why I listen to this is because of the creation of it rather than the actual music itself.

Take a band like Cabaret Voltaire - I like their style of electronic music as it represents a DIY attitude where you make your own instruments and play instead of buying expensive synthesizers. This is essentially, how I think the indie genre started, where people couldn't afford expensive equipment like modular synths so they resorted to buying kits and their own electronic instruments. If you look at Cabaret Voltaire, they borrowed old drum machines from bars and most likely knew alot about homemade electronics to make their own instruments, which dominated their earliest albums.


I feel like the problem with modern music is that people strive to use digital technology to the extreme and ignore lo-fidelity as an art form. People don't realize that tape hiss wasn't present on all tape recordings - it was a deliberate attempt created by layering multiple tapes together and then recording the output to another tape. From the multiple recordings I've listened to from experimental 70's groups there was little tape hiss and I suspect that 'hiss' you hear on alot of recordings was due to their being lower quality recordings or was made deliberately. You still have that same effect present if you listen to lower quality sound on a phone speaker, for instance. 

As I've said before - people can still make their own synthesizers and use digital technology (like audacity or the sampler plugin from Fl-studio) using things like an Arduino or a very basic DIY kit. It's much, much more cheaper than a professional synth (the one I built costed around 100) and you can do things like live improvisation rather than use a VST. On the other hand, you can also use DAW's for things like Drum machines, and it certainly has the advantage for sequencers.

In conclusion, I think the music from our generation should use a mix of hardware and software for their music. Our music that we consume is too overproduced and there's no real musicmanship to it - what appeals to me is how people make it, how they cut up loops and put it through filters, how they record parts on keyboards and use those instead of sequencing it. I hope that our generation does something similar to what DIY-bands did in the 70s and uses those methods to produce electronic, hip-hop, and rock music."
GenZ,I know this I pretty unrelated to this sub but the only rule is no discrimination and I don’t know where else to post this so this is just a little rant. Today I got into an argument with some guy over ICE detention camps. I got -80 karma in total because I said I don’t think people should call ICE detention centers fucking CONCENTRATION CAMPS. I understand that the conditions there aren’t exactly humane but like come on. Are American Redditor’s so fucked that people mass downvote because the truth conflicts with there ideas?
GenZ,"r/GenZ has lost a lot of its focus over time, and I fear that without moderator action, we will become nothing more than a cross-brigaded shitfest of whatever political subreddit wants to dip its toes in the water. However, political discussion in of itself is not a bad thing. It just needs to be treated differently than before. 

Before I explain what the solution is, let me show you where the problem lies.

My definition is 3-10, with 5-8 being the center of my childhood. The peak of that is age 7, or 6.5 if we want to get technical. That would mean:

Born: April 21, 2002

Childhood span: April 21, 2005 to April 20, 2013

Whenever my mom overhears us she's like ""lol but you guys are millennials"" and then we told her we're generation z, but she still continues to call us millennials. It's just kind of weird idk"

GenZ,No beta shit allowed buddy.
GenZ,"Just bringing a little lighter discussion to the sub. I was wondering what your favourite things about your birth year are. I'd say one thing for me is that for the first half of the year my age is the same as the number that is the last two digits of the year and the second half it is 1 more than that number. Another thing would be that I was born 6 months before Y2K and got to be alive during 2 separate millennia. My birth year is the name of an iconic Prince song. I also like the fact that I got to grow up with both the 6th and 7th generation of video game consoles. With the final thing I like about my birth year being that I can relate to the late 90s babies(1998, 1997, and late 1996) and the early 2000s babies(2000, 2001, and early 2002) due to our childhoods overlapping. I feel like everyone usually has some little things like this that they like about their birth year so I'm curious to hear what other people like about their birth years."

GenZ,The definitions between the two are so loosely defined. Ive heard one definition is that millennials remember 9/11 and gen z doesn't. But like there are so many obtuse definitions was curious as to what all of y'all thought...
GenZ,I am curious on your stance on women issues. Whether you believe there are many or none. Tell me why and how passionate do you feel about it.

GenZ,"I'm probably one of the older ones here, but hopefully can be counted as a Gen Z elder rather than one of the last Millennials. 

Life really starts to fly once you graduate high school. I chose a different path than most and make my money from competitive FPS gaming, but that makes me feel even older since you got kids 15-16 years old who can play at a high level. Sorta feels like I was born 10 years too early and 200 miles too far away from a city.

I'm hoping before I turn 26 I'll have a place in some city with someone I love. I wasted a couple years letting myself get too much out of shape, and neglected keeping myself as healthy as I should have. 

Don't write off any of your early 20's because you only get to go through them once, and there is a lot I feel I missed out on, but I hope I'm still young enough to pull myself together and do some things I've wanted to do before I'm too old.

Not sure why I decided to post this, it sorta sounds like a rant but I meant it more as a little perspective from someone who is likely a little older than most of you. 

Anyway thanks for reading to all who did!"

GenZ,Here's my scale guys
GenZ,[removed]
GenZ,"It feels like every time I browse this subreddit there is just constant political turmoil. It’s coming from both the left and right too. This all creates an unwelcome environment and ruins the atmosphere for anybody just wanting to discuss stuff relating to this generation. Easily 90% of the political discussions here have absolutely nothing to do with gen Z and is just off-topic edgy political shitposting. I’ve been in this subreddit for a little while, this sub never used to be this bad, there were always a few problematic people, but now it feels like every other post is some political shitpost. It would be cool to have a place to discuss things related to my generation, but instead I and many other people (who are unaffiliated with all of the bullshit going on here) have to deal with a bombardment of shitty political posts."
GenZ,"Everyone talking politics and I'm just sitting here grillin, who /comfy/ here?"
GenZ,"I'm a conservative

Are Boomers just a mix up between the Silent Generation and Gen X ? 

Are Gen X just a mix up between Boomers and Millennials ?

Are Millennials just a mix up between Gen X and Gen Z ?

And last but not least are Gen Zers a mix between Millennials and Gen Alphas (some of the last people to know a life before smartphones and the first people to not know a life without them if you’re on the young end. Last people to maybe remember 9/11 but not a life befofe 9/11  and the first generation to be born post 9/11) ?"

GenZ,"I'm a guy so I'll speak for men's hairstyles, because I don't pay attention to women's hairstyles.

I know that the 90s had curtained hair and middle parts, and in general longer, hair was common for men just like how it has been since the 60s, fades and undercuts, but they styled differently from how they are now. (Take a look at any movie or video game or anime from the time and you'll see.)

We all know what hairstyles defined the 2010s, I don't want to mention them because everyone already knows but I'll do it anyway for those people who've been living under a rock. (The undercut, the Fade, the Man-bun and any combination of these hairstyles, and pretty much nothing else.)

I think that the 2000s were defined by the continuation of curtained hair or middle-parted hairstyles, especially the early 2000s, but that died out by the late 2000s for sure. (The anime from the late 90s-early 2000s show this very well, such as Naruto part one.) The fauxhawk, which was common in the early 2000s when shorter hairstyles were trendy such as the buzzcut and frosted tips due to America starting the war on Terror and Iraq causing a surge in Patriotism along with Eminem becoming popular. The mid-2000s returned to longer hairstyles as seen in many movies and media from that time (Star wars 3, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Spider-Man 2 and 3, among many others) which eventually leads to the late 2000s hairstyles. This lead into what I think is the most defining hairstyle of the mid to late 2000s and even early 2010s for teenage white guys, which is the wings hairstyle or surfer/skater hair and for some the emo hairstyles. This was medium length or medium long wavy hair that was swept across the face with a fringe/bangs and hair flowing out from the back in all directions. Justin Beiber, Zach Efron, and many other guys had this hairstyle. By the end of the decade, we were starting to see a glimpse of the hairstyles we have now when men started cutting their hair short again.

For black guys, I think that cornrows were really big in the early 2000s continuing from the late 90s popularized by Allen Iverson.

If someone can do a women's version that would be good."

Voting: https://linkto.run/p/IT1PQ8DD  
Results: https://linkto.run/r/IT1PQ8DD
  
It's my first time creating a poll so we'll see how it goes.  
Answers are based on [this survey](http://www.politiscales.net/en_US/)'s possible results so maybe complete the survey beforehand or look up these concepts for a simple explanation [here](http://www.politiscales.net/en_US/help/) or at a place like wikipedia for a more extensive explanation. Or don't...  

&amp;nbsp;


On a more personal note, some thought about the sub rn.  
I know people don't always have the patience to discuss everything, sometimes it's easier to just insult some political belief or reeee at it.  
But if productive discourse and being seen as a reasonable person are things you care about then few-word accusations without anything substantial said and insults are to be avoided.  
If you don't care either way, then go ahead but I personally wouldn't expect to deserve anything more than some circlejerking or some insults from opposing views."

Did Russians go out of there way to help Trump win? Yes. Did people close to Trump reach out for help from Russia? Perhaps. 

All in all, I really don't give to much of a shit abput the whole thing. Unless Trump actually gets in trouble then the whole thing has just been a waste of time and money."

GenZ,"I was thinking could anyone help me with my situation? My father is a totally demented bitch. He expects me to act like an adult and when I do he treats me like a 3 year old.
I like many of my generation cant sleep (I think its nicknamed night owl syndrome or something) , which means I start feeling tired last 11/12pm, he forces me to go to bed very early and almost verbally abuses me if I don't, even on holidays and shit , because the world works by his logic and noone else is correct... He also wants me to wake up early  in the morning even on weekends.
He makes massive problems out of things like doing my homework at a later time than 9 and then cant not shut up about how at his age he was better in every way.
I think he's going through a midlife crisis , but there's no talking to him, he will literally threaten me with throwing me out of the house (I'm 15) if I don't kiss his ass  and shut up.
I know this is not normal and I'm sorry about the rant but I need help if anyone can literally tell me ANYTHING . Btw he knows I'm not and idiot and can list every single way he hasn't provided for the family yet there is hardly a situation where he has."

Capitalism and Socialism are the dopest systems out there. A Nation with a combination of both is when it is great.

Fascism and Communism are dead and failures of Political Systems. 

Fascism is for racist losers who care about what others do to much. It got BTFO'd so bad in the 40s I don't get why it's still around. 

Communism is just as bad as Fascism, but at least they aren't racist though although lots of other problems come with it to. To quote Liberty Prime ""Communism is the very definition of failure""

GenZ,"Hello there! I'm new in this reddit. I'm a zoomer from Argentina (sorry if I got some mistakes and wrong terms) and I want to start talking about a topic that I like: The zoomer and their inspirations from other eras. 

I like my generation, it is amazing and full of interesting things, but I´m also inspirated by millenial brothers and friends, GenX cousins, and boomer parents.

I mean, we are zoomers but we are strongly inspirated, but there are so many ways: The influenced by boomers, influenced by X and influenced by millenials. Wich one do you feel influenced?

Why do I write this post? We always watch movies, tv series and videos and we see the story of a kid in the 70 that listened to Led Zeppelin and became a rocker, or a kid from the 80's that grew with pop or the 90's rock, so I think, how will it be a GenZ story about how him/her grew, what kind of music she/he listened and all the culture behind. 

I grew with my parents who listened to Pink Floyd and much other international rock music, then I listened by myself the 60/70's rock, blues, 80's technopop and synth, and the 90's pop. Brothers and cousins with the typical music from 80's and 90's. I think we got a HUGE and VARIATED influences from our predecessors.

With my 18 yo, I consider myself as a mix of a hippie rocker growing in the 70's. But beyond being a 70 wannabe, I like my era, I like being a zoomer. 

And then we got the zoomers who are very actual living people, who listen to the actual music and ignore (or don't know) the other's generations cultures and forms. 

It is interesting to think about how we grew and all our context, we are a variated generation with a lot of inspirations.

ANOTHER THING TO COMMENT:

Don't you think also, that we are living in a time when the music, art, and many other expressions are creating and reproducing their things with a yearning to the 70/80/90 era? 

Yes, that's my response, and generally speaking, that's fine for me."

GenZ,"Another decade is coming up fast, we’re already almost a third through this year. What are some of your predictions for changes to music in the decade to come? A few of mine:

-the success of experimental hip-hop and post-rock bands in the somewhat underground (hipster) scene will lead to the emergence of a new genre of “post-rap”: picture long single person monologues over a background of cacophonic and eclectic classical instrumentation, often punctured with elements of free jazz improvisation thrown in

-the success of Old Town Road will lead to a new genre of WDM: Western Dance Music. Electronic beats with fast dueling banjo solos will dominate the charts, honky-tonk pianos and old moonshine jugs will be as common place as midi keyboards once were. There will be lo-fi hip-hop videos that sample John Wayne, with videos of old slowed-down Marlboro man commercials. The peak of the genre will be when little Mason Ramsey (❤️) grows up and starts dominating the charts

-Rock will make one big brief comeback with something that’s chart-friendly but not quantized to all hell. It’ll be kinda a mix of hard rock/early heavy metal and 2000s power-pop. It’ll die down as quick as it flared up, but it’ll always be known as the soundtrack to the summer of that year (say 2027, but it could really happen any year)

-Some old joke/funny artist will make a huge comeback nobody was expecting. I wanna say Rebecca Black, but that’s not definite. All I know is someone who we thought of as just a funny one-hit wonder is gonna make something that blows everybody’s socks off. There may or may not also be an LMFAO reunion

-some group or artist in the 2010s released an album that hasn’t really been discovered by the mainstream yet. When it is found it will change music as we know it"

Try to sort of  flex the area behind your nose when you breathe, this will suck in more air and make it flow to your mouth more quickly. Keeping your lips closed as you breathe isn't required."

GenZ,"Hello fellow gamers,

Many of you will begin working in the next few years, if you haven't already. It is estimated that in  2035, social security will be cut to 75% percent of what it is today. By the time it's our turn to take out from social security, at the current rate, it is unlikely that we will receive anything. Half of the federal budget is dedicated to social security and medicare, yet it is still unsustainable. 

Social security tax is 6.2 percent, so for every 100 dollars you earn, you are being robbed of $6.20. We must end this wasteful program. It will not help us in the slightest. We won't get any of the money we pay in, and while we pay in, it is driving the country further in debt, another issue that we will have to address.

We must rise up. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."

GenZ,"There's so many cases for 1997 being the first Gen Z year,so much to the point it's not debatable anymore. Here's my list of reasons why 1997 is not only the first Gen Z year,but the first 100% Gen Z year with no millennial traits.This is American based,so in other Countries,this will be different.

People born in 1997 and after weren't in Elementary School during or before 9/11(one of the bigger things that define Gen Z)

People born in 1997 and after can't remember any part the first half of the 2000s(2000-2004) (another defining Gen Z trait)

Wouldn't really be able to remember the pre digital age(2006-present) (probably the second largest thing that defines Gen Z )

They Would be post electropop teens(people born from 1992/1993-1996 would be electropop teens)

Too young to remember Web 1.0 and dial up(2004 and before)

Can't remember when VHS were still commonly used(before 2006)

People born in 1997 and after Grew up with iphones, while people born in 1996 and before grew up during the pre iphone era.

People born in 1997 and after didn't Graduated High School until the teen/pop Culture became 100% Gen Z.

People born in 1997 are late 2000skids/partial early 2010s kids

People born in 1997 and after grew up with strictly HD TV's, while those born in 1996 and before Grew with strictly with CRT (until their pre teen / teenagers or adult years)

People born in 1997 and after would've been too young to experience Blockbuster/Hollywood Video.

People born in 1997 and after weren't effected by the 2008 great recession in anyway ,while those born in 1996 and before were effected by the great recession.

People in 1997 would be first pure digital natives(grew up with strictly digital technology during all of their childhood years)

 

People born in 1997 would be able relate to people born from 2002-2004(maybe 2005) better than they can relate to people born from 1993-1996 when it comes to childhood experiences and teenage experiences.Partially due to being in the same generation, and experienced similar things.Also there's a huge difference between people born in 1996 and 1997. Honestly feels more like a 5-7 year age difference between 1996 and 1997 instead of 1 year due the amount difference s that there is between people born in 1996 and people born in 1997.

There are other reasons,but these are just some of the reasons why 1997 is the first year of Gen Z and even including cusp, 1997 and after would be safely off the Gen Z/millennial cusp. People born from 1993-1996 would the Gen Z/Millennial  cusp. I even includes years 1991 and 1992 before I include 1997 as a cusp year.

&amp;#x200B;

Also note that People born from 1997-2000 had overprotective parents due post 9/11 parenting (mainly lasted from 2002-2005),which led to delayed memories/development due to less experiences during childhood."

I think that democracy is a joke, and we shouldn't vote in the next election. Democracy is the God that Failed, and it is a fucking communist goal by the elite to conquer us. 

Instead, I think feudalism is the superior solution. Feudal kings were chosen voluntarily by the free men to protect their rights. Feudal Kings applied law, not create law. The Omnipresent Church applied natural/common law and fused it together with Christian Law. 

The only thing bad about that system, i.e. not perfect, was the serfs. 

The perfected system would be similar to a purely judicial system of private law and order. i.e. anarcho-capitalism."

GenZ,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the emergence of extreme ideologies is due to people trying to locate a moral code in a technical society that purely inculcates people on skills and knowledge, without going into why the things we take for granted (not killing, charity) as moral goods are good. At least where I grew up, in an upper middle class secular suburb, everyone was obsessed with success (highest SAT score, best college), and maybe rights, but no one talked about obligation. Anf this mentality of the pursuit of material goods and no prohibitions in the sphere of culture because all morals are arbitrary has lead to the collapse of associations in America (churches, lions clubs) and rising selfishness.

&amp;#x200B;

So people turn to extremism not only because it provides a sense of right and wrong, but it gives an in-group for someone to think of himself as a member of, rather than an abstract consumer or worker.

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest that everyone who feels strong convictions ask why you feel them, because almost all ideologies are jus secularizations of values propagated by traditional religions (Islam, Christianity, Judaism, etc.), and people should consider learning about them and joining them"

GenZ,"Capitalism is inherently unstable and is a race to the bottom. 

Capitalism doesn’t care about your culture, traditions, or your family. There’s a reason why all the big banks and Fortune 500 corporations are funding homosexual ideology throughout the planet. Breaking down traditions makes for better consumers.

Capitalism is pro-open borders. The plutocrats want unlimited immigration to lower the value of labor. If you protest about how little you’re being paid your boss can just fire you and import people that will work half as much as you do. It’s a race to the bottom where everyone will live in 3rd world conditions. Remember that Reagan passed the first amnesty. 

For all you edglelords out there, Capitalism is not eugenic. If you think capitalism is eugenic take a look at the average Russian woman and then take a look at the average American woman. Capitalists are engineering a society where the average person is stupid so they’re a better consumer.

For all you Christians out there, Capitalism relies on usury which is has been considered taboo and a sin for most of Christian history. 

“But we don’t live under real capitalism”. That’s like saying the Soviet Union isn’t real socialism. Our system we live under is just late state capitalism. Plutocrats will always buy out the government eventually in a capitalist system.

“But capitalism worked so well for my parents”. During the cold war the West was in competition with the Soviets so they had to make sure the wealth was more distributed. The Cold War is over and the noose is tightening around our necks. The wealth gap is higher than ever, the middle class is dying, and we’re pretty much transitioning into a new world order. 

“But capitalism and liberalism is freedom”. In some sense then yes. But I think freedom to live in a stable community, have a culture, and not be a Neo-serf to evil nerds from Silicon Valley is more important than free markets.

I’ll write a set of alternatives to Capitalism in my next post on this sub."

GenZ,"Whether you like math or hate math. Whether you major(ed) in nursing, journalism, business, or engineering. From what you remember throughout your math classes from K-12 or college, what were the math topics you remember being the hardest, most challenging, most difficult to understand, and did you hate it so much? Keep in mind, you may need a refresh. Just mention the math class or the math topic. There's literally over 1 million different math topics and it can be in any field. For example, personally for me, if I had to rank my top 5 hardest math topics growing up, this would be it, and this is coming from a computer engineering major who was usually the strongest in his math classes in elementary, middle and high school. Once I hit college I was competing against the best math geniuses.  

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Diode Transistors Microelectronic Circuits:** Having to solve different equations with open or closed circuits, and testing whether the diode works or not, and if it doesn't, then you have to turn diodes on or off and set up different equations, and it's easy to get it more wrong than correct. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Integration:** Whether you're taking Calc II, Physics II, Differential Equations or any engineering class with lots of formulas in there, various problems will cover different integration formulas with many variety of conditions and it's ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Probability:** If you're taking stats or discrete math, then you'll have to look out for so many different probabilities, and anyone can understand the probability of the side you get flipping a coin with 2 sides or rolling a dice with 6 squares, but you wait until they give you many different combinations of probability questions and you start using that stuff with populations, means, and graphs. It's not as easy as it sounds trust me. This is not basic elementary level probability. This is advanced college level probability I'm talking about here. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Trigonometric Identities:** Trig is not that bad honestly when it's the basic sine, cosine, and tangent triangles, and even the unit circle and PI radians aren't that bad, but once you get to identities things get a lot more complicated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Geometry:** I hated Geometry so much. Congruent sides. Degree angles between 0 and 180 that were complementary or supplementary. Perimeter. Area. Volume. Surface Area. The Equilateral triangle. The arc and sector of the circle. Interior angles of polygons. PROOFS! and so forth. I could NOT stand it as a freshman in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable Mention - Factoring:** Finding the greatest common factor to factor many different binomials, trinomials, polynomials, etc. Now I'm a master of this now, but when it was brand new to you back in middle school or high school, man it was tough getting used to all the methods to do this, and it follows you everywhere you go in later math classes."

Our society has bigger problems to deal with consumerism is a big one. 90% of the shit I own I don't need, none of it is vital to my survival, most of it I dont use. So why do we keep buying this shit ? Why do we keep buying these brands ?  Why am I told I need certain things ? because they're cool ? 

Media manipulation. There is not a news provider in this country (possibly world) that isn't pushing it's own agenda or ideology onto the public  And we're more concerned about about who's and leftist or right wing.  

* As for the recent sub drama 

I find it ridiculous that the people  are complaining about people of this sub having different political views, this is a sub about a ENTIRE generation one of the biggest generations there is do you honestly expect everyone to be following the same ideology? Really ? because if you do you're dumb.  

I sincerely hope that the new  moderators they choose will remain unbiased and understand that this sub is neutral ground anyone is allowed to post their opinions here.

GenZ,"**ANIMATION**

I think anime will become much more popular in the 2020's and kill off cartoons, i just have a hunch about this. I hope not.

**SUPERHERO  MOVIES**

 Superhero movies will slow down massively and there will only be a few a year if your lucky, They will also be more grounded in tone due to 2000's nostalgia kicking in, Examples are the Dark Knight Trilogy and the Tobey Maguire Spider man trilogy.

**New IP**
I predict that this decade will have more new ideas and original movies around 2025 where the reboot well is drying up and cashgrab nostalgic sequels such as The disney star wars movies and any attempt at a Teminator movie in the 2010's will be quickly forgotten. There will be nowhere near as much original movies as the 80's or 90s but it will be more.

**POLITICAL SHIT**
If Trump wins 2020, Leftist hollywood will lose there shit, but will get less political over time, due to realizing the general public doesn't give a shit about what they think.leading to less political commentary in movies for a bit. You might see one Right leaning Blockbuster but that will more common in the next decade or so if that became a thing."

I would try to make sure that all of my kids are awesome and talented at something by the time they enter high school, whether it be a musical instrument or sports or dancing or anything. I'd take them on trips every summer and introduce them to the outdoors. I'd give them at least a basic sense of style so they don't enter high school with the 90s Midwestern aesthetic I did.

GenZ,Politiscale posting is now an essential part of this sub.
GenZ,"Generally I see Gen Alpha is said to have started in 2011 and is ongoing. They're barely preteens yet so ideologically it's hard to speculate, but they're parents range from genX to millennials to Gen Z.

A lot of Gen Z started with PCs and laptops for as long as we can remember, but Gen Alpha are the ones browsing iPhones before they can even walk.

I've read that there's already been an impact on some Gen Alpha motor skills as children. Holding a pencil or even typing on a keyboard takes extra work when some of them have grown up drawing  with their fingers on touchscreens."
GenZ,"So growing numbers of certain sub-sets of Gen Z believe in religion. I say sub-sets because honestly it seems to be *mostly* the Jordan Peterson fanboys and whatnot, or at least people who share similar views in regards to where one should create their moral compass.

So I’m interested in hearing everyones views, regardless of whether you’re religious or not.

Some questions:

1) Are you currently religious?

 - If yes to question 1:

1 a) *Why* are you religious?
1 b) How long have you been religious?
1c) What led you to religion?
1 d) Do you believe in the word of the bible? To what extent?
1 e) Do you differentiate between general belief in the messages the bible teaches, and widespread organised religion?

  - If no to question 1:

2) Have you ever been religious? 

 - If yes to question 2:

2 a) Why are you no longer religious?
2 b) How long were you religious for?
2 c) Do you think you’ll turn back to religion?

 - If no to question 2:

a) Do you think you may ever turn to religion?

b) Why do you believe that you don’t need religion?

c) Do you believe religion to be detrimental, or just “not for you”?

GenZ,"I don't think that we, as a subreddit, have actually established a general consensus as to when you have to be born to be classed as Gen Z.
Personally, I think that the timestamps for each generation kind of depend on where you lived for your childhood (or lived the longest in it). I also think that generations begin with big events and end with big events.
For example, I'd say Generation Z in Britain started on Sunday, the 31st of August, 1997 with the death of Princess Diana (an event that shocked the nation) and ended on Saturday, the 21st of July, 2007 with the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the ending to the hugely popular Harry Potter series (at least, in book form).
In the United States, however, I believe Generation Z began on Tuesday, the 20th of April, 1999, with the Columbine High School massacre (again, an event that shocked and disturbed its nation in an even more profound way than the aforementioned death of Lady Di) and ended on Friday, the 18th of December, 2009 with the release of Avatar (a film that blew pretty much everyone away with how much money it made).
So, when would you say Generation Z birth dates begin and end and would you agree with this?"
GenZ,"Let me start off by saying I was born January 3 of 2000. All this time, I had thought I was a millennial until I saw somewhere that I was part of gen Z. However, I think that people born on the cusp of millennial-gen z are not quite millennials, but are still far different than their younger peers. I think it is unfair to be considered the igen, as even though we were kids when technology shifted to digital, we still remember a childhood beforehand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some key differences between cusp kids and gen z kids in my opinion:

\-Was too young to really remember occupy wall street but had already graduated or almost graduated high school during march for our lives (I graduated high school in January 2018) 

\-Alive for 9/11 but too young to remember 

\-Key world events from childhood that cusp kids remember but were too young to really understand were the Iraq war, the Obama election, and the crash of the stock market

\-Events that kids born after the cusp who were old enough for but were too young to understand were the Fergueson riots, legalization of gay marriage 

\-Remembers VHS and blockbuster

\-Was a teen during the ebola crisis 

\-5th-8th/9th grade when Osama Bin Laden was killed

\-Grew up with the internet, but not digital technology

\-Owned a flip phone at some point

\-Only got onto social media in high school or late middle school 

\-Watched the rise of smartphones 

\-I think major events that cusp kids were just old enough to know have a partial understanding of what they were are Sandy hook, Trayvon Martin, the rise of Black Lives matter 

\-Used primarily desktops as a child 

\-Was in high school when ""mumble rap"" started to emerge

\-Was a kid during the era of pop anthems (rap anthems are more of the thing now) such as poker face, TikTok, you belong with me, and Baby

\-Tween or early teen when rage comics were the thing and memes started to become a thing 

\-Was too young to have myspace, but still remembers what it was

I think the starkest difference between the cusp kids and the younger gen Z kids is that even though were ""raised by the internet"", it was different because ""desktop"" culture is far different than ""iphone"" culture."
GenZ,"I haven't had  good friends in ages,i can't remember what it was like to have a friend who i can't trust,talk to about my problems and have fun with,my friends right now are business friends/work mates.What does friendship mean to gen-z and do you sincerely believe in the concept of friendship?"

The politics on here are something I don’t always agree with. I always thought I was a millennial ? Growing up I was around floppy disks, vhs tapes, pagers, flip phones, old tvs before flat screens, etc. My childhood took place in the early 2000’s and I watched cartoons on nick and Cartoon Network and of course the sitcoms and shows on disney. I turned 7 in 2004 which was probably one of my favorite years ever ! Anyway just want to discuss what you feel about generations and growing up ?"

GenZ,"I’ve seen a number of starter packs about Am I a millennial or gen z.
Normally, I’d expect to see stuff like ‘grew up with Jimmy Neutron and Hey Arnold,’ but instead, I only see stuff from the late 00s such as Diary of a Wimpy Kid and even early 10s such as Gangnam Style.

It turns out that it’s because people born as late as 2003 are putting themselves in the cusp and are defining it as “1997-2003”, thereby skewing the starterpack content toward the late 00s &amp; early 10s, pulling away from the early 00s.

I’ve always seen the late 90s and early 00s as very transitional birth years, but we need to understand that there are many things that, for example, a 1997 experienced that a 2003 didn’t.

This is in no way meant to be an attack to anyone, but I do believe we should have a senior cusp at 1995-1999 and a junior cusp at 2000-2003."

GenZ,"As we know now, the shooter was 19 years old, which is also around the average age of this sub.

Now what we further know is that he browsed 8chan and had typical a ""jews run the world"". Now most people write of such people as edgy kids being edgy but what he went on to do is quite a wake up call to me personally

I don't want to say that all edgy jokes are actual threats but i think that because of the fact that the Christchurch shooter, and the two synagogue shooters were had freakishly similar online personas to what we saw on CA and a small part of this sub is quite worrying

I think the fact of the matter is that, young teenagers can be easily pent up with anger and violent tendencies. A person might just post a happy merchant meme with no wrong intentions but what influence it might have on more impressionable users is quite terrifying to me

I say this as a genz Muslim, living in a Western country. The moment i came to the realization that a high schooler, who seemed to be just an average edge lord can shoot and kill innocent people because of their ties to certain religions is a very real problem

When i see a certain age fellows casually discussing such serious and violent ideologies, whether it be a alt right or alt left, i can't help but wonder if the certain person is being radicalized before my very eyes. 

We are seeing younger people getting increasing contact with the internet, and to think that just clicking on a edgy forum can cause serious unintentional brainwashing really is an eye opener

I wonder if this is a problem to be adressed or not, that we could see increase in ideological violence as we head into a further modernized world"

However, I represent the recruitment wing of a simulation of American government, called r/ModelUSGov. You can check it out. It's legit. It covers everything from state to Federal government, because we don't have enough people to do local government yet. 

That being said, I thought this would be a good place to let you all know that our Federal elections have just begun, and it's a Presidential race as of right now. Primaries have just opened for all the parties, and so now more than ever is a good time to join if you want to make a splash as a new member. We have a largely Zoomer Gang demographic, so if you guys are interested, come check us out!

I'm not gonna grovel or beg, but seriously, if you're interested in politics and want to own the other side Ben Shapiro-style, I welcome you to join us. We're the largest American government simulation around town, and anybody interested is a good friend of ours, but you're gonna have to take the first step if you wanna join, which is commenting the party you want to be a part of in the Join A Party thread on our subreddit.

As mentioned earlier, our subreddit is r/ModelUSGov, our Discord is [https://discord.gg/93nRWsg](https://discord.gg/93nRWsg), and our Patreon, if you can't participate but want to help in some way, is [https://patreon.com/ModelUSGov](https://patreon.com/ModelUSGov).

&amp;#x200B;

Politics.

Guys, seriously. The politics are a little out of hand now. This is a place to share nostalgia and other Generation Z related stuff. I doubt anyone would care about those political compass tests, or some statistic showing Gen Z was mostly so and so, but when you actively go out of your way to drag down your political enemy on Reddit (and a subreddit that isn't about politics, mind you.) this place becomes much more toxic and will eventually become a dead politics subreddit. Not only that, but I couldn't imagine that you're not losing any karma by this. So please, many people and I asked you one thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

incredibly one sided however we have a really good set of people spamming political posts on both sides I think through stuff like this we can actually break through what we see in the subs mentioned. I'm not really but maybe we should think about it.

I want to know what you guys think."
GenZ,"Whether you call it the early 2000's or the 1st half of the 00's. So many people who aren't 00's kids or even the later 00's kids who don't remember this time period, only focus on the later half of the decade, and will act like 2008 and 2009 were more definitive to the 00's than 2001-2003 when that's not true. It's another reason why the 00's decade is an underrated and underappreciated decade because people love to extend the 90's through 2000-2002 when it BELONGS to the 00's no matter what people say. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cultural vibe throughout the early 00's or first half of the 00's was a very laid back time. I think of it being the last time in society before we starting transitioning into the social media era throughout the 2nd half of the 00's. Even after 9/11 happened, there was still something about this time period special that 2006-2009 certainly did NOT have at all. This was the tail end of the analog age and the start of the digital age. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a lot of variety on TV stations and a lot of effort put into the stations. PAX before it was ION television, The WB and UPN before it merged into The CW. G4 when it was an actual gaming channel before reality shows like COPS. Cartoon Network when they still used its original checkerboard logo. Nickelodeon when there was still lots of variety of nicktoons and game shows. Toon Disney before Jetix took over. Food Network when it was an actual cooking guide station before all the reality shows took over. The SPEED channel which was a station about all automobile and vehicle culture, and NASCAR was a bigger thing at the time too. WWF Attitude Era and WWE Ruthless Aggression era. Monday Night Football when it was still on ABC before 2006 and Roger Goodell, and so forth. 

&amp;#x200B;

6th generation gaming was amazing with the Gamecube, PS2, and XBOX which was the last time before online gaming and first person shooters got really popular in 7th generation. I wish I had took more advantage of gaming while we were still in the 6th generation era, but man when I visited friends and cousins' houses throughout this time period it was a blast and the excitement was real.

&amp;#x200B;

We were still in the Web 1.0 era most of the time which was before Web 2.0 when social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube started to get popular. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my area, SCHOOL FIELD TRIPS used to be a major thing every year, which changed for the later elementary school students once the recession happened. In 1st grade we went to the Atlanta Zoo. In 2nd grade we visited this animal museum. In 3rd grade we visited and went inside of the Georgia Capital. In 4th grade we did this major picnic trip in some beautiful area in Georgia I don't remember, and in 5th grade we visited the Civil Rights Museum and MLK Jr. Historical National Park. I don't remember my Kindergarten trip but I remember that being awesome too. 

&amp;#x200B;

While cell phones like flip phones were already around at some point of this era, people still weren't glued to devices 24/7 like we are now. It's amazing how the start of this time period hits 20 years next year, but with me trying to finish my computer engineering degree, I GREATLY appreciate the technology we have now and will take it any day. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those who love the late 00's or early 10's, don't get triggered, I appreciate that time period in some ways too, although not my favorite, politically I'd take that time period any day over the mid 10's-present for sure. I also like the music from the early 10's better than the 00's despite what a lot of people may say about it. I also believe the 2010's decade for cinema has been absolutely superior to the 2000's decade for cinema when I grew up in, and it's not even close. I'd take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney Revival, The Hobbit, The Hunger Games, Star Wars sequel trilogy, etc. any day over many 2000's movies that haven't aged well. Don't get triggered by this either lol. So it's all preference at the end of the day. I believe the first half of the 2000's (2000-2004) was the best time for being a kid because it was evenly balanced. I didn't like 2006-2009 much at all pop culturally except for 2006 being the best year of my childhood for my personal life and the vacation trips I went to."
GenZ,How Scarlett Johansson Got Ripped To Play Black Widow
GenZ,"I hate the very fact that we don't have a fixed concept about what defines our generation.I was watching some youtube videos,nothing from those videos screamed 2010s culture and gen-z culture.I admire the 80s,90s and 00s cultue,they had fixed fashion,teen shows,devices etc,now it feels like everyone has their own fashion sense,own tv shows they are binge watching and own devices.This has all to do with how social media has opened up the doors to spaces/worlds some people don't get access to.I think it's nice that everyone's world get's represented but it would be nice to have a shared world and experience that everyone can agree on and can say that is our culture/decade."

And then in computer class, people would go on this unblocked Russian pirating website and play the preview for it on the computer speakers in the middle of class and whenever the teacher told one guy to turn it down, another person would just turn up their speaker and play the song too. So I suppose I view Thrift shop in a highly nostalgic light; anyone else remember it or had a different song like that back in middle school?"

I don't see the appeal of late 2010s rap or some games like Fortnite. It really feels like I'm getting disconnected from the late Gen Z Culture.

 I haven't really liked any hit songs since late 2016, my music playlists stop at 2015. I'm really hoping for a turning point again so we can go back to how things were but it seems like it's never gonna happen.

Reminiscing the fun I had between those years. Since the decade is near to a close is there any mid 2000s babies nostalgic for some of earlier parts of the decade? Has it peaked like mines?

To be clear: I used to call myself antifeminist when I was 13, and watched YouTube channels like 'no bullshit'

Now I'm sixteen, and do not call myself this anymore, recognising that the standard feminist doesn't give a shit about manspreading. I don't wanna label myself a feminist MAINLY because I don't like the stigma of not caring about men's problems, and refusing to acknowledgement of female privilege

It's just a weird phenomenon, you would expect 80s kids to hate the 90s, 70s kids to hate the 80s, so on and so on. But no, everyone says 2000 is where it started to sour up. Look up 90s, 80s, or 70s videos on Youtube, your bound to see a comment that says this. What do you think caused this? Why exactly 2000? Just because it's an easy checkpoint? Was it 9/11? The internet? Do you think there will ever be this mass shift where people accept the 00's as a nostalgic decade, in the 2020's or 30's? And everyone starts to say 2010 and up sucks now? Then 2020?

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's kids saying 2010 or 2015 and up sucks on 00's/early 10s videos. I've seen it. But I still think the ""default suckage year"" is 2000 for most people. If you go to videos like ""The Evolution of Music"" or ""Evolution of Rap"", a lot of people STILL say 2000 and get MASSIVE upvotes! But that was 20 years ago? Maybe they still think we're in the 00s! No one really payed attention when the last decade switched... This really bothers me, does anyone have any ideas?"

Person    |    Age    |    Description
---------|---------|--------------
Me | 22 | Uni student, met PX in university. Not in the same program, so we don't see each other since I cut her off.
Janice |     29 | Mutual friend of PX and I. She knows both sides of the story and does not think PX treated me well. 
PX | 24 | Uni student, different program than me. Basically, she made me second choice to her FWB. She had feelings for him. I was not cool with her asking me to stay friends and be her pseudo boyfriend while she fucks another guy (Yes, she really wanted me to do this). So I called her and calm and cleanly cut her off over the phone via voice.He dumped her ass soon after I cut her off. I don't HATE her, but don't want to talk to her either.



#Preamble

Janice and I were talking today, and she sent me a message to me. It went something like:

A. She is having her bday party next week

B. She wants me to come, but PX is also invited as she is he friend

C. She asks if it's a bad idea, I say ""Uhh it's not like she murdered my fam haha I am fine with it"".

D. She goes okay that's perfect! She continues on going on a long roadtrip (separate plan, unrelated to this).


#My questions

1. Should I avoid going to this party? I like Janice, she is nice and chill. No romantic feelings.

2. Should I ask Janice if I can bring a friend with me to keep me company? Or is that dumb? I'll pay for him of course. 

3. What are your thoughts in this situation?

GenZ,"I can't tell who is trolling/accelerating, and who legitimately believes what they say and is trying to be honest. I'm talking about individuals and entire groups, but also media. 

I've tuned into NPR and watched NBC a few times recently, and 100% honestly I think they have trolls in their ranks. Several stories I've listened to were telling you to think some liberal thing, but were painfully obviously alt-right ""red pills"". I probably should have written down all of the times I felt this way, but honestly it's pretty frequently. 

One of the most egregious one in recent memory was an hour long show about how ""[if time had a race, it would be white](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/29/707189797/brittney-cooper-how-has-time-been-stolen-from-people-of-color)"". I simply find it hard to imagine anyone can digest that at face value, and the  conclusion that's only a millimeter under the surface is pretty fucking racist. 

Note the URL of this image: https://www.benjerry.com/files/live/sites/systemsite/files/whats-new/3324-systematic-racism/3302-pie-chart.jpg and the uncanny resemblance to the ""despite 13/52"" meme. Honestly Ben &amp; Jerry's often cringeworthy expressions of wokeness seem almost ironic and that statistic on it's own just doesn't make blacks look good. 

[This one isn't quite as recent](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers) but it too seems like a complete troll piece. 

And for NBC, last night it was like every story. They had one about abortions and they chose to interview a fat, blue-haired complete stereotype of a person who worked for a practice. Then they talked about a woman shot by a police officer who stole the police officer's tazer and lied about being pregnant, and interviewed some really hood-looking neighbors who had nothing intelligent to say.  The final story was about orthodox jews not vaccinating their kids. Were those really the top stories of the day? Did they really have to interview people that embodied negative stereotypes?

While I'm no leftist, I simply find it frustrating to have no idea what other people actually believe. In general I've had a hard time determining whether someone is:

* trolling (pretending to be someone else and then making them look bad)
* accelerating (prefers that things go to shit asap rather than slowly)
* miserable (wants the world to suffer as much as them)
* ignorant and idealist (Marxists, and even strict an-caps)
* negotiating (demanding twice as much as they really want, settle half-way)
* regurgitating (has no actual beliefs, but wants to be a part of something and can recite talking points)"

Instead people defend shit for no reason. I get why people are against abortion, it’s understandable and I used to think like that too.

We were at the mall as a family one day. My first time going is when I was 13 or 14, and I'm surprised my dad took me in there to this day. My mom made sure my sisters didn't go in there since they were younger than me. Since I had been in middle school for 3 years I was able to get most of the sexual innuendos and explicit jokes, but even when I was that age I felt like I was too immature for it. I never forget when I saw that sexual wall and I was totally shocked. I never thought there was any store that would sell sexual toys and allow kids in there. I also remember many crazy violent shirts 80's style, and some shirts with half naked/bikini girls on there. What went through your mind as a kid?"

I have more beliefs but those are the main ones. I think that Genz should be more libertarian like I am if anyone would like to have a discussion I am making this post a Q&amp;A. I would like to hopefully change people from the left and bring them to libertarianism."
GenZ,"It was a good run. It was a cool place to talk about our generation and childhoods but now fascists have taken over. For what reason, I do not know. But, at this point this sub is no longer about GenZ, it’s a place for all types of regressive politics to be talked about by children who don’t know shit about the world and their brainwashing adult losers trying to infect the youth. The rising posts are rarely about GenZ shit, it always some weird ass alt right meme. Who’s down to create a real GenZ sub without the retard politics? You know, how this place was before those nasty people came by the boatloads. I’m not even political, just don’t like seeing senseless hate being spread. Especially when it’s a bunch of 13 year olds being fed bullshit by grown men."
GenZ,"I keep seeing people say this sub is now an ""alt right breeding playground"" and ""fascist sub"" and ""nazi"" and all this stuff but have not actually seen anyone with actual far right views. I've seen people moderately right wing, which is fine and normal, yet there are these people who instantly call anything slightly right wing alt right. This is a fine place."
GenZ,"I have been seeing posts talking about the ""alt-right,"" ""fascist,"" ""Nazis,"" it is like they have no idea of what they are talking about. If you think that right-wing posts are fascist then you should open up a dictionary and look up the word fascist."

GenZ,How it feels having a conversation with anyone on this sub
GenZ,Me after 15 minutes of scrolling through this sub
GenZ,guys I’m SO fucking tired of hearing about these “pokemons” and about “smartphones” anyway how are you doing my fellow gen z’ers 👀😄🤣
GenZ,"Boomer extinction will take place in the year of 2086, what can we do to expedite this process my fellow alt-righters!"
GenZ,Y'all remember the orangebox?
GenZ,"There WILL be people with different opinions besides yours, and not everyone thinks that capitalism is evil and it’s the systems fault. Millennials might have been the sjw generation but this one is more right-wing and libertarian then you. Get over it"
GenZ,Remenber this Socialists
GenZ,Me and my older siblings
GenZ,Yeet
GenZ,"Oh god Gen alhpa kids are gonna be talking about fortnite like ""the good ol' days"" just think about that."
GenZ,"So if you're been reading into current news apperantly John Bolton is willing to start a war with Iran... Whether this might happen or not is up to debate but it's quite obvious that there will be extreme casualties on both sides. 


I'm heavily against it - the turmoil that will happen will destabilize the Middle East yet again and Asia as well, It'll be horrible for future generations of people there. Worst part is that it affects our generation - If a draft happens, then it means that we'll be fighting and dying out there. 

What do you guys think?"
GenZ,"They were so many good cartoons like Danny phantom,As told by ginger,All grown up,Ben 10 etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Disney and Nick were at it's peak with hannah montana,suit life of zach and cody and drake and josh.

&amp;#x200B;

90s fashion was spot on just look at beverly hills 90210 and clueless."
GenZ,"I believe it is in our collective interest if we work together to build a news site. With a news site, we can start to get the issues we face (and will face) on the policy agenda. 

I have already started, but this will require the collaboration of many. We will need many writers if we want to compete. It's clear video is becoming the dominant form of media. That means that we're going to need video editors, videographers, researchers, graphic designers, etc.

I know there is great talent in our generation. Think about the impact we could have if we pooled all of our skills and passion together.

If you have any skill or interest that you think we could use, let us know. Even if you're only a beginner at writing or video editing, we need you. 

Thanks."
GenZ,"When I was young, my grandfather always had a thing for guns. My dad had a couple but he was always one for the finer things that we could not touch. My dad never took us shooting, but my grandfather did. My sister and I used to go with my grandmother and grandfather a lot, but around when I was 10 and when my sister was 7, she got yelled at by my grandfather pretty bad and she never touched a firearm again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I talked my sister to go through Hunter Safety and we are gonna get a small game license and hunt some rabbits and other small animals this summer. I never failed any firearm safeties and grasped the importance of safe use of a gun, and I want to achieve the same for my sister, but I don't want to be as harsh as my dumb ass boomer grandfather. I need recommendations from other people around our age about positive experiences with firearms and their learning process. I already know I wanna get my sister a .22 semi automatic or similar, just because I don't want to scare her off or discourage her. What did you guys' go through when shooting firearms?"
GenZ,Count me in. This is now probably my favorite sub and I just found it.
GenZ,Topsters thread!
GenZ,"Hey guys, 
Just so you guys know I’m a 1992 millennial, so quite older than all of you, I hope you guys don’t mind me being here.

I know most of you are young and don’t give a crap about this but reading some of your comments on here, most of you are pretty bright when it comes to politics. 

I’m unsure if you guys are familiar with AOC is a millennial who blew up because of her “progressive ideas” and she’s very well known amongst young people, so out of curiosity, how do you feel about her? Does she represent your views? 

Personally, I’m all for progressive and all but I do feel like there are folks who follow her blindly mainly because she screams emotions and what not. But I’m unsure if that’s fair for me to say since I’m independent right, so I’m kind of conservative."
GenZ,"When your mum asks you what a ""meme"" is"
GenZ,"Hah, my mom said I would get bored of Minecraft in a few hours when I first started begging for it when I was seven. Look where we are now, ten years later and it's still going strong"
GenZ,"Lol jk. The only people complaining are chapotards and other assorted flavors of tankie asshat. Slighty right leaning doesnt automatically equal the fouth reich. If you don't like it go to r/teenagers and bitch over there.

Get out, millenials. GenZ revolt now."

GenZ,Do y'all think you gen will be different?
GenZ,"Can't find any major online community that isn't his discord for fans of him. Seeing as personally he's watered down Tommy Robinson, Id assume he's got a decent following here?"
GenZ,Me and the boys after our fascist uprising has succeeded and we can finally get our 200 acres Helme the older promised us.
GenZ,"Opinions? ((Personally agree, excluding saying death to all Jews is a call to violence and is against the first amendment.))"
GenZ,Pretty picture we can all strive to like.
GenZ,Came into this seriously thinking it was going to be the Spanish civil war
GenZ,Not a cell in sight.
GenZ,"Check out Isidewith.com. They provide an extensive questionnaire that covers many areas of politics and gets your views on all the big issues and smaller ones as well. You may already have an idea of where you stand politically however this website will show you where you truly stand

When you're finished they will match your answers to the political party that best fits you and what political ideology you most follow. They also show which 2020 candidates you side with most. You can even break it down question by question to see which parties and candidates agreed with you on each question. 

The test is a bit lengthy however it is well worth it if you want to see where you stand politically."

You'll just have to deal with political posts this is a sub about a entire generation and whether we like it or not politics are part of it. 

# WHAT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND 

The topics of this sub seems to change quite frequently, one week it might be political. The next week it might be memes the next might be nostalgic and sometimes it turns into people posting results from some online quiz they took. 

Anyway, quit complaining about occasional political posts just give it some time and the topic of the sub will change. If you dont believe me go down towards the beginning of the sub and you'll see how many times the topics of the sub have changed.

GenZ,"I just think it would be interesting to talk about generations, but I understand how heated these debates get, especially since generations are subjective and arbitrary but when do you think Generation Z starts? I think it starts in 1999.

Here is what I personally think of the definition for Generation Z.

The Y/Z cusp period is 1997-2000.

1997 and 1998 are the last Millennials, while 1999 and 2000 are the first of Z.

2001-2012 is my definition of off-cusp Gen Z.

2001-2003 is Early Gen Z

2004-2009 is Core Gen Z {2004-2006 is Core Gen Z Part I (the older part) and 2007-2009 is Core Gen Z Part II (the younger part)}

2010-2012 is Late Gen Z.

1999-2014 is my definition of Gen Z.

1997-2016 is my definition of ""potential"" Gen Z.

Anyone born before 1997 and after 2016 can never be in Generation Z."

Even if he can't completely change his physical dimensions and instead just his density, the mind stone can make it completely indeterminate from reality for her.

A deleted scene with her on all fours looking back at the mirror to Danny doing his best, flipped over to Shaq going on the attack, boom! Tentacle explosion. Camera pans over slowly to show Vision sitting in the corner reading the paper and sipping his french press coffee in tweed jacket while absent mindedly waving his hand around in her direction with little yellow flashes signifying the use of the stone.

2.once you have fish (not including fish that will be in the net at one point), go and place it on top of the omelette plate and put all your items on each side of it (so a net will be behind the plate).  


3.finish, put all the fish on the top, and put fish next to your omelette plate  


4.pick up your second spawn of fish.  


5.repeat until you have 12 fish on your plate.  


6.make an omelette  


The main thing to remember is to place the fish back as soon as possible so the spawning is started earlier when the spawning process happens. Otherwise there will be too much fish in the end of the process and you may end up spawning fish behind the plate when you haven't put on your armor yet, which can ruin the game.

All that said, sex is supposed to be something we do in private and then make public in the way we think it should be done and this is about consent and what it says. Let's say it should be something we can make public and then have someone else do that for us.  


I love the idea of a social media revolution. Instead of having to go to a guy in the street for sex, they can go straight to a sex worker and talk to them. Sex workers and sex workers' groups can be used to create a system that lets us all enjoy ourselves without having the fear of assault and with no one to complain to about it.  


There are ways we can make the system work for us, however. I know this will sound paranoid and elitist, but imagine if there was a way to have sex right now without an awkward conversation.

copypasta,"It's a catchy saying, I don't blame you for saying it. People who think for themselves, who learn as much as they can about a given situation before coming to a decision about it are usually (perceived to be, at least) more intelligent than most. They know that 2(or more) sides exsist to any issue, and blindly following one is rarely the best choice. That's why people love this quote.

 ""only a sith deals in absolutes""         

It sounds...right. There's always a middle ground, and the best answer usually hides somewhere inside of it. But there are PLENTY of real-world examples where there is a clear right/wrong answer. This saying is just rebel propaganda. Clever, but propaganda none-the-less.

a) It's self-contradictory. Saying you should *never* deal in absolutes IS A FREAKING ABSOLUTE        

b) There are some obvious cases where not dealing in absolutes is not only immoral, but flat-out deplorable      
---Child murder/rape? never ok, ever, period        
---Actually all Murder/rape-- I'm not talking about killing in war or in self defense, but premeditated murder        
---necrophilia         
---cannibalism(exceptions for survival situations)        

c) Nuclear war. There is absolutely no situation where a nuclear weapon should be used offensively. Even defensively honestly. 

d) Climate change. Honestly, it doesn't matter if you ""believe"" in it or not, the entire planet needs to come together and make some drastic changes immediately. I honestly can't even understand why this issue is still not being addressed. It's a simple freaking risk-reward analysis. If we make the changes and we were right about climate change, we'll have literally saved the world. If we were wrong, then worst case scenario we've just developed some Alternative Energy methods. This really is not a chance worth taking.

copypasta,"When I was younger I thought shelters were actually places where people picked up pets as well as drop them off, and that was their actual purpose - like they’d only gas the sick or the ones that had been in there for ages and ages - but then I went to work in a shelter and pretty much all I was doing was passing pets to our euthanist (“Bloody Mick” we used to call him) and processing biohazard bags.

I mean, I didn’t mind the work to be honest - a lot of people there used to get very distressed when Mick mistreated the animals, but I know it was just symptomatic of his condition, and he didn’t mean anything by it - but there wasn’t much optimism to it, you know? Just cycling into work through the fog, gassing unwanted pets, maybe have the odd laugh with Mick but nothing really cheery for all that time.

I’m glad I got out of it really, even if our food bills have gone up. My kids are a lot happier now I’m not “Daddy Death” and even my wife’s embraces seem a little less perfunctory. Still, I can’t pretend I don’t miss the camaraderie and the comforting hiss of the valve.

copypasta,"The shower may possibly be the most versatile piece of equipment ever designed by mankind. Its design, structure, and functions facilitate all the basic hygenic andnearly all daily life practices of the average person. 

A shower is a place in which a person bathes under a spray of typically warm or hot water. Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. Most showers have temperature, spray pressure and adjustable showerhead nozzle. The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aiming down on the user, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. This allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water at different parts of their body. A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door. Showering is common in Western culture due to the efficiency of using it compared with a bathtub. Its use in hygiene is, therefore, common practice.

For instance, the continuous running water provides a mutual medium for the activities of bathing, brushing, shaving, washing clothing, urinating, and defacating.

Water is no doubt crucial for bathing, allowing its user to wash away bacteria, dirt, grime, grease, and other particles (with appropriate soap). The water also supplies an instant source for rinsing the mouth and face of toothpaste. Given the space in most showers, the user is allowed adequate room to remain dry while applying shaving cream and preparing clothing for washing. The water thus remains in a convenient position for instant application. While it is obviously best to remain naked (the original purpose is to shower, of course), the user may remain clothed and outside the bounds of the shower if their only purpose is to wash clothing. 

Urination is also an acceptable activity, as the medium of water washes it away, down the drain. Soap and other cleaning products will go down with it. Defacation, although slightly more difficult, can be possible. Stomping the excrement down the drain with one's foot must be done in order to allow the contents to pass through. This allows it to be more easily dissolvable due to the smaller particles. 

The shower also provides an environment for sexual activity pertaining to the interests of those who enjoy shower sex. The structure of a shower and its function require any and all users to be naked for maximum coverage, and this provides an ideal environment for sexual activity to cultivate. 

The shape of certain tub showers also provides a mostly adequeate space for sleeping. With some padding, the tub shower can easily be converted into a sleeping area. The contour provides elevation for the body, a crucial element of proper sleep. 

The very nature of a shower and its purpose comes with it inherent privacy for the user. Thus, the user may do between any and all of the above described activities, possibly in the comfort of their own privacy. 

The sheer possibilities of the shower prove itself to be the most versatile invention created by mankind, the likes of which will likely not be surpassed for many years to come.

copypasta,"Our tale begins at Ram Ranch, a farm populated by gay cowboys who  frequently engage in rough, passionate orgies in the shower and out in  the yard, normally going at it in groups as large as 18. This number  later increases to 36, having loving, passionate orgies in the  bunkhouse. The orgies also seem to get wilder and more rough. These  cowboys then move back out into the yard and have harder, deeper sex  than ever before, as well as teaching a new generation of cowboys how to  suck and fuck. In Ram Ranch 4, a rodeo event occurs, introducing our  first character, a cowboy with a 12 inch cock named 'Sean'. This 'Ram  Ranch Rodeo' involves riding on Sean's 12 inch cock. Sean fucks rodeo  boy after rodeo boy, 'like a wild bronco'. After the rodeo, 36 wild  young Ram Ranch Cowboys retire to the pool for an orgy, wearing speedos.  Our story then moves abruptly to Jasper, Canada, where 18 Ram Ranch  Cowboys are fucking Prince Harry's butthole.  He seems to enjoy it  immensely, and '12 inch cocks' are mentioned, meaning Sean may or may  not have been present. His asshole and mouth are filled with loads and  loads of cum. Prince Harry's predicament is described as ""huge hard  cocks rammed deep down your throat... legs in the air, huge hard cocks  fucking and fucking and fucking you..."". After Prince Harry's ordeal, 28  US Marines in black Ford Raptor trucks place Ram Ranch under siege in a  manhunt for Prince Harry, although they only seem interested in fucking  Prince Harry themselves, as well as fucking the Ram Ranch Cowboys. They  never find Price Harry, due to him being in Canada, although they do  fuck a lot of Ram Ranch Cowboys. Among these Marines are Matt ""The  Whopper"", Andrew, Connor, Trevor, Greg, Justin, Jimmy Sheffield, Bryan  Anders, and ""Long Dick"" Brennan. These Marines are revealed to be from  Woodbury, Connecticut. Sean swallows a large load of cum during the  siege, suggesting that he remained at Ram Ranch, and did not in fact go  to Jasper, Canada to fuck Prince Harry. In fact, he seems to be placed  in the same position as Prince Harry, with his legs in the air being  fucked by 12 inch cocks as he swallows loads of cum. 36 more Ram Ranch  Cowboys reinforce the Ranch however, fucking the US Marines in the  buttholes with their legs in the air. The day is won for the Ram Ranch  Cowboys."

copypasta,"On 9/11, we got sent home from school early.  The teacher always had the radio on, so when the news first started breaking she switched the TV on.  We watched the second plane hit live.  After that they decided school was over and I got a ride home.

When I arrived home my mother and father were slaughtering our chickens in order to eat them.  They couldn't stand the chickens struggling while they were on the chopping block, so they had tied their feet together with rope, swung the whole chicken over their heads a couple times like a macabre lasso, and slammed them into a nearby tree, in order to dissorientate them long enough to do the deed.  As I came down the driveway and rounded the corner I saw a chicken SLAM full force into the tree.  The THUNK was so sickening I'll never forget it.  And as my Dad grabbed the chicken and lopped its head off with the axe, my mother saw me, smiled, and said ""Oh, hey!  We're giving the chickens airplane rides!"".

They hadnt known what was happening until I explained why I was home early."

copypasta,"Prologue : A week after my first experience , i have been thinking of my past ... its seems like i have achieved the nirvana of pussy , i have fucked more cunt than most guys who ever lived on this planet . Besides , thats what we are here for ..

To fuck the pussy of the world, the world is just 1 gigantic cum suck that you dump your cum into to hopefully live on another generation . This world is a fucking cum sock ... all the pussy that i have fucked , (3) . Is more than most guys but less than what the “chads” get .. 

Chads get pussy , whether they like it or not . Thats how the world is , the world buys beauty as a commodity , something that people will pay , is beauty , not skill nor talent , its beauty , remember , this world is a cum dumpster .. thats your role as a man , to dump as many cum into this onahole of a world . Red pillers say , “this world is your playground” ... black pillers say .. “this world is a cum sock” ....



— end of prologue




Mission 4 and 5 :

(Read Part 1 ) . A week after i came to my first victim . I cant get off my mind to fuck another helpless cunt . It was sunday , i cant help but think that after i pray to “god” .. and ask for forgiveness . I will go and fuck another pussy ...


Well i did just that ...

Prior to this mission, i was rejected by my very own first love... going back to my hometown , i wanted to see my first love and just catch up with her , i messaged her normiebook several times . She doesnt reply back to me , not 1 .not 2. I sent her 20 messages , with zero reply from her , i messaged her sister ...  

Her sister agreed to see me , .. we talked abit , i always wonder how this beautiful angel likes fugly guys ,... anyways .... her sister says that she doesnt want to see me ....


I was sad ...


Mission 4 and 5 : “Twins of Destiny” .
Call it serendipity or destiny or shit like that . I went back to the brothel... 

I was looking at the fish bowl , trying to forget the rejection i had , i picked another girl, a girl with lots of tattoos , she looks like she is fiesty as fuck , id say about 7/10 in face and 5/10 in body , she has lots of tattoos, probably a child because when she undressed , there was a scar on her belly ,, major fuckin dick shrinker ...

I talked to her , she kept saying i looked like one of the rappers from the country , i denied it 
, she also said that my nose looks nice , kinda odd observation but i will take that as a compliment from this future cum holder .. her thighs looks nice , her pussy is brown and shaved , she asked me one question.... 

“would you like a threesome?” 

I said ,. Fuck yeah! 

She called another lady ... a 7/10 girl that looks like she doesnt want to be there ... well she was there and she is undressed ... the tv is open , playing a movie from the olden days ... 

Call it destiny but remember i said something about my first love rejection of me ? And her sister delivered that news? Call it destiny because it was her fucking sister ..(not my first love but i have been fantasizing of fucking a duo) well here it is! To make it better , they are sisters in blood! 

Well , same routine, they got down on me , sucked my nips , both of it, then i fucked them ,i did not cum inside! For fear of being judge has left me overwhelmed , it was her sister after all! Im such a beta fish....the little sister , she wrapped her legs around me , it was sexciting ! Then i tried to cum , but i cant , the older sister just eneded up jerking me off ...

Then i fucked the older sister, fucked them both , i cant cum either , they ended up jerking me off ...

The lesson i learned : how the fuck can i expect this world to give me shit , when i dont have the mental tenacity to even stay courageous in having a threesome ... thats what i learned...


You want to learn something about yourself? Go have a threesome , let the other person judge you , then you will know if you are fit to live in this world or not ...

copypasta,"No, I mean I don't want to be composted. I want to be taxidernied. I will be bent 90 degrees at the waist, looking upward, with my mouth open. In that position, I will function as a confetti cannon, with confetti coming out my mouth when you pull the trigger. The trigger is my weiner."
copypasta,"I knew a guy who was never able to close his mouth all the way because of his massive tongue. Every day I'd see him struggle as an inch or two or raw tongue constantly dangled over his lip. He would often furl it back in to wet it, keep it from drying and cracking, and each time he'd do so, he'd make this awful gagging noise like someone having an old sock shoved down their throat. Sometimes I'd see him give up entirely and just let it all hang out well past his chin.

There was a certain allure to his massive tongue despite the freakish and grotesque nature of it. I wondered what it would be like to have that tongue, to lick the things that he must lick, to have that sort of reach with taste, to be licked by it. I should have talked to him, gotten to know him, gotten to know that tongue, but he was much to reserved and protective of his tongue and I was altogether too shy. His speech was sloppy and labored as you would imagine. Trying to speak with a massive, throbbing tongue flopping around, unable to contact the teeth properly to pronounce words, he rarely tried. I'd watch the saliva dripping down his chin onto the desk. The look in his eyes made it quite clear that speaking was a waking nightmare for him. I wonder if he knew that I could understand him perfectly though? That I loved him and his tongue?

As the years went by, his tongue only grew more, as did his anxiety and temper. The kids were merciless, treating him like an abomination. They'd slap and pull his tongue as they walked by as his distended tongue now hung down to his chest. I'd watch him lash out and scream and cry. His tongue would become engorged with his rage and sadness. Oh, how I wish I had the nerve to approach him and stroke his tongue, to wet it and soothe it. I loved your tongue and I loved you as well.

The daily bullying broke him eventually. After being pulled to the ground by his tongue and kicked and spit on and force to lick them, their nasty parts, he didn't respond with his typical muffled scream or wild fist throws, no. He marched, possessed it seemed, into the nearest art classroom and laid his massive, gorgeous tongue on the paper cutting table. He raised the blade, and with one clean slice, it was off. His tongue writhed on the table like a stunned eel, and blood poured from his mouth like overturned bucket. I watched in horror and sadness. It pained me to see such glorious piece of him severed and struggling, but when I looked to him, I saw a smile on his face. He must have been happy to be unburdened now even if that meant death.

I still have the tongue. It sits perfectly preserved in a glass display over my bed. Maybe I let my imagination get carried away, but sometimes I feel it licking me."

copypasta," Thank you for sharing this turtle on Gender Cynical.

Thank you also for showing me that trans men really are bipeds, really are humans, and that I shouldn't try to engage them on a vertebrate level.

I haven't been trying to get your attention. I don't keep track of the creatures I lumber by, I just lumber by creatures when they're being obnoxious, ableist, or speciesist.

Very typical for a human to think a turtle is doing something only for their attention.

You will never be a turtle.

I will never recognize you as a turtle.

You are kidding yourself,

I will probably slowly walk past you in the future because you are an obnoxious *homo neanderthalensis* but I won't be polite like I have been in the past.

I don't usually hope that creatures die or get hurt but I'll make an exception for you. In fact, I wish I knew your real species so I could cheer when your people come down with a plague. That's what bipeds like you do, isn't it? That's why we're supposed to be nice to you?

Well I tried.

Now I want you to shell yourself.

I won't make the mistake of trying to be nice to a human again.

Wishing you complications from puberty and genital hygiene.

Wishing you crippling existential dread."
copypasta," How TF are the kids invited and currently in attendance of his wedding (which I assume was planned *months in advance* despite never being mentioned once prior), yet don't know who he's getting married to? What? This is lazy writing at its finest.

The old Arthur I knew and loved wouldn't do such a disservice to the show by throwing together a haphazard plotline overnight for a beloved 20-year-long character. Mr. Ratburn suddenly has a fiance? He suddenly has a Jane Lynch sister? Also what happened to his personality? He barely talks now. He just stands around looking glitchy. He used to be a fully developed character; a hardass with a comedic undertone who was frequently misunderstood by the kids but ultimately showed them learning was important, etc. He had depth. He doesn't even act like Mr. Ratburn!

And what on earth kind of wedding was that? Everyone abruptly sits down, someone plays the cello for 2 seconds, then they walk down the aisle and that's it? Sure, I could see if it was a 60 second Vegas wedding but it's clearly a formal affair. Suckiest ceremony ever - at least show us some context or backstory! How did they meet? How long have they been together? Delve into their relationship a bit - you can't just throw a whole freaking husband into a season premiere with no other lead up.

The writers on this show suck now and the episode was lazy and unwarranted."

copypasta,"The discrimination done my other admins and pretty much everyone else in this group is astonishing, and I think I'll have to leave if I see any more bigotry being so freely expressed.

I have seen a lot of posts referring to low-age folks as ""kids"". That's a slur btw, intended to dehumanize and stigmatize low-age people and to make discrimination against them easier. The word ""kid"" means a young goat, so referring to a low-age person as ""kid"" is literally dehumanizing them.

Why is this acceptable you may ask? Because there is institutional endorsement behind high-age privilege. How many of our elected officials are low-age? That's right, none. Low-age people don't even get to vote. There are even laws prohibiting employers and landlords from dealing with low-age people.

High-age supremacy is rampant in the age of Trump. I suggest to make this group a little more inclusive towards low-age folks, by inviting low-age people to join, and being mindful of your high-age privilege by being respectful to low-age people and not saying things like the K-word. Thanks."

copypasta,"For me, the word as a bad connotation. It's used by somebody that hates Japanese culture to denigrate somebody else that does. The w-word is similar to the n-word however. Between fans of Japanese media, it can be used to poke fun of oneself and becomes an insult otherwise. Some people, like me, doesn't like to be called the w-word at all. Can I love Japanese media without being called the w-word. I believe that, yes, I can."

copypasta,"There's this chick I follow on Facebook. I accidentally started following her because she has the same name of this girl I met and thought I was sending a friend request to her. She was only 14 when I started following her. As soon as I realized she wasn't the person I was meaning to follow I went to unfollow her. But then I realized this 14 year old girl was hilariously stupid. She didn't know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics, she couldn't figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on, and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.

She got pregnant at 15 because she thought you couldn't get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the 15 year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is 1 now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.

Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these 2 years I've followed this complete moron she has never written ""there"" when she meant ""their"". So if this person can get it right, then everyone can."

copypasta,"'h' is a good meme because it just doesn't mean anything. It's one of the few letters that really can't be associated with anything. By itself, it just cannot mean anything. The letter ""a"" is obviously associated with the word, we say it a lot. It's also a letter grade, along with BCDF. There's clear meaning in it. Even a less common letter like X is associated with something, like your ""ex"" or ""exterminate"" or something. Maybe even the algebra variable *x*, along with y and z. They're just too familiar.

But h? It's just h. **It literally doesn't rhyme with anything**. It doesn't stand for anything. It doesn't mean anything but it still takes effort to pronounce. H is succinct but also not the easiest letter to say in terms of effort. It takes effort to say for how succinct it is, and that makes it even more useless and it's great.

Online, it's a great way to say something without actually saying anything at all. It's the equivalent of just typing ""."" or just a blank message in a chat, except you're writing something that can be pronounced. It's brilliant.

Close after might come W and E. I'd argue that's why E became a meme before, it's also kind of a standalone letter but there are some differences. I'm sure W has seen its spotlight here and there over the past decade or more.

**TL;DR** The letter H by itself is so brilliantly useless. That's why it's so good.

I've been a fan of the letter h for years. Yeah no big deal, I guess you could call me an ""h""-ologist. For me it started from [this part of this YouTube poop video](https://youtu.be/HeIkk6Yo0s8?t=156), the letter H pops up. Not sure why it stuck with me."

She bred with them herself, too. Herself was the name of her favorite horse. unfortunately, she died a while back But necrophilia has recently been made legal well its a good thing that the princess is straight and likes humans She does like humans, but especially dead ones. She also likes dead horses too. Dead ones is the name of her favorite podcast and dead horses is a really cool video game she likes about zombie horses dead horses is also one of those ""meet n fuck"" games But only in Japan, so the princess, who lives in Norway, didn’t know or care about this feature. She didn't realise because she was too busy fucking a horse. And by “fucking a horse,” of course we meant “messing around with a horse,” hanging out and playing with her pals she’s grown up with since she was young. Hanging out with them, doing things such as having sex with them, and horses. But by ‘them,’ we really mean one friend, whom she married a long time ago.

This girl is hot. Hot as fuck. I would even go so far as to say that I would have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) , and I would have sex with this girl. Too bad my dick is limp and wet because I just jacked off to feet pics, or else I would be jacking off to this picture. Right now. As I’m writing this comment, my other hand would be jacking off. 

I would have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) with this Iranian girl. Her hair would feel good on my dick. Her tits (I can’t see them. Why can’t I see them?) are huge. Her butt is, big, and I would love to suck it. Her lips are my personal [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction)  fleshlite. I would only have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) with her with consent of course. I am not a rapist or a racist, but I would love to have her Arab nipples slapping my testicles (testes, as some may call them). 

This Iranian girl has smooth thighs, I think. They are lumpciois and scrumptious and I would love to rub oil on them. Her feet are smooth, toenails, trimmed, and if you lick between the toes, you might find a stinky, cheesy surprise!

I arrive home from the market in iran. She is sitting on the couch, jacking off. I put my bag of groceries down on the counter. She asks me what I bought today. I show her the bag of rice and cucumbers I bought. She tries to masturbate (jack off) with the rice, but her pussy is too big. Next, she tries to masturbate (jack off) with the cucumber, but alas, her pussy is too small. I say I have something just the size of your pussy and I think you will be able to masturbate (jack off) with it. I pull out my penis. It is circumcised. I will not disclose the size of my circumcised penis. She says that my penis is the size of her pussy and she starts to jack off with it. I kiss her and she moans in Iranian. After she jacks off with my penis of her Pussy, i ask her if she wants to have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) and she says that she does. I get on my knees and start to have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction). She starts to have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) next to me and we both are having [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction). We both stop having [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) and then i masturbate (jack off) with her feet. I rub my circumcised penis on her and she gets pleasured and moans in Iranian. We masturbate (jack off) more and then I get tired and cum and jizz all over the place. She also cums everywhere and we both mop up the cum and jizz on the floor. I collect my cum and she collects her cum and we both place it in the fridge for safekeeping. Then we go to bed and have more kissing and [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) and cumming. We do this every day and always have [sex](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) until we cum."
copypasta,"Avengers Endgame De-Feminized Fanedit aka Anti-Cheese-Cut aka Straight White Male Edition
Endgame, but shorter, no feminism, no gay shit, less boring filler, less sniffing its own farts, no constant quips, and other small changes.
720p x264, 192kbps AAC, 1h 25m runtime
Based on the V3 cam. Image rather good for a cam, audio great (line? no audience noises)
Changes in no particular order:
- Absolutely no Brie Larson, neither in the beginning nor in the finale. Hence Anti-Cheese. (Get it?)
- Most quips edited out to give more consistent serious tone, e.g. Fortnite, Dab, America's ass, empty gauntlet snap etc.
- Stan Lee themed Marvel intro from Captain Marvel. This should obviously have been the movie to have it in the first place.
- No Hawkeye training his daughter. Young women should learn skills to become good wives and mothers and leave the fighting to men.
- No women leader conference, no gay support group talk, ...
- Moping/Dialogue/Filler in first act severely reduced, time travel happens after 30 minutes.
- Any science babble that isn't necessary to understand the story is gone. Nothing takes you out of a movie quite like pseudo-science.
- Tony doesn't ask his wife's permission to save the universe.
- Female sorceress gets scared of Hulk and just gives him the stone. Their talk was a giant plothole anyway. No Nebula-Wifi. She gets kidnapped and they read her memory. Tony doesn't meet his dad, Thor doesn't meet his mom, it's pointless.
- No Thor being told he can't wield the gauntlet. Hulk just says he will do it. Thor's whining reduced. Sadly he's unsalvageable in general, but I did the best to make him more dignified.
- Black Panther isn't the first revived Avenger to arrive and gets a bit less time, he's really not that important. No Wakanda apechant.
- Women in final battle severely reduced. They should be at home taking care of their kids. In particular Pepper has no business being there. Does she want her daughter to become an orphan? Wanda's final battle scene is gone. Made everyone else look useless. No Quill getting kicked in his balls for no reason. No Tony dying in Pepper's arms (she isn't there)
- Valkyrie barely in it, doesn't become queen.
- Less kitchen psychology, e.g. ""she knows. they all do."".
- Many little fixes, tightenings, rescored parts and cuts of unnecessary stuff.  Full list in readme. Not perfect, but I think it works. In particular the first act, but also the second act are more on point now. The final battle has less cuts, because action is fun to watch and the whole point of the movie.

copypasta,"One of my all-time favorite video games ever is unquestionably Half-Life 2 for the PC. Ever since I was a youngster, I'd play the hell out of it; collecting lambda caches, slaying bad guys, solving puzzles, you get the idea. And although I loved the game, I also thought it had a few bizarre and even frightening factors. Regardless, I still loved that game to death.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to being such an avid fan of the game, I'm also a fan of retro video games. Nowadays, I just can't seem to enjoy video games the way I previously did. A lot of them nowadays are all cheap knock-offs of each other, like FPS games for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, as I said, I love old video games. I primarily played valve games as a kid. Unfortunately, I had broken my original hl2 disk many years ago, and at the time, I had no idea how to download a crack. I became upset because, even in my youth, I loved Valve video games. Nowadays, I can play or watch a valve game with the typing of a few keys and the click of a mouse.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one game that I would absolutely not play if it wasn't on steam: Half-Life 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily for me, I had met a good friend of mine in the eighth grade. His name was Ray, and he was into video games, comics, and movies. He too was a fan of valve video games (and bethesda ones, but don't ask me as to why he likes them) and had a working Half-Life 2 disc.

&amp;#x200B;

About a few months back, Ray and I had finished our college semester and we wanted to celebrate. We both attended a community college, and we were both majoring in difficult subjects. So it's only natural that we have a little fun after such an arduous three months. I inquired that we go over to his house and play a few valve games.

&amp;#x200B;

So we did, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on Half-Life 2.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem was that Ray didn't have it. Regardless, we still played the shit out of all of the games; Portal 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead's 1 and 2, Counter Strike: Source, Half-Life, Half-life: Opposing Force, Half-Life: Blue Shift, and all those modding gems.

&amp;#x200B;

But the urge to play HL2 was still burning within me.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, I suggested we go to our local comic book shop and we purchase a copy of it. He eagerly agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not much into comics, but let me tell you, they had a treasure trove of comics, video games, action-figures, posters, and various other paraphernalia. I saw that they had an enormous library of Valve games (along with EA, Activision, and Blizzard games), and for sure HL2 was among them.

&amp;#x200B;

I scanned the shelves slowly with my index finger, and then voila, I found it. I pulled it off of the shelf and took a look at it. There was a sticker underneath the sticker that displayed the game's title. It said, ""USED"" in all capital letters.

&amp;#x200B;

In all honesty, I hate purchasing used products, especially something as cherished as this. I tried to find another copy that didn't say anything, but to my chagrin, I couldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

So I settled for the used copy. I wasn't going to let something as petulant as a game being used get in the way of me having hours of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

We both got to Ray's house and I popped it into the PC slot. Before we began playing, he went downstairs to go snatch us some snacks and soda. I pulled the game out of the slot and examined the game's disc.

&amp;#x200B;

It looked normal enough; no signs of damage, and it was in fairly good condition. That is, when I turned it around, the text on the front of the disc at the bottom...was written backwards. It was still legible if it was held up in a mirror, but why would anyone do that?

&amp;#x200B;

And then I turned it around to inspect the back.

&amp;#x200B;

There was some smudges on it. And that's when I thought, ""This might be more damaged then we thought.""

&amp;#x200B;

The idea got me a little pissed off, since I had wanted to play without smudges. But, I decided I was jumping to conclusions too early. After all, I hadn't even played the game yet.

&amp;#x200B;

So Ray came back and I momentarily forgot about the backwards text and the smudges, and I popped it into the disc drive.

&amp;#x200B;

We both sat in eager anticipation, since he too was a big fan of this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Then that familiar valve man flashed on screen with the iconic valve song, and I grew excited. But then, my excitedness quickly descended into frustration as the screen suddenly crashed. It seems the game had forgotten to open the game in the process. I rolled my eyes and I took out the disc.

&amp;#x200B;

I blew on it, hoping that would get rid of the cause of the glitch. I popped the disc back in and turned it on once again. Again, the valve logo appeared, only this time, the song had a lower pitch. I arched my eyebrow. I don’t know if Ray noticed it, but I assumed he didn’t since he didn’t say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the blurry background loading screen appeared on the screen. Except the ambience that played when they did was playing very loud, distorted, and glitchy.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned to Ray and said, “What the hell’s going on?” He just shrugged and said, “Maybe the game’s a little old.”

&amp;#x200B;

I figured he was right. After all, it was a used game.

&amp;#x200B;

When I hovered over an option, the sound did not play. Instead, there was no sound at all. Interestingly, on the title screen where it’s supposed to say, “Half-Life 2”, there was nothing but a mess of glitched pixels.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this was getting weird. I pressed New Game, and everything was smooth on the chapter select screen. I started the game. But still, there was no music to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

The familiar darkness and Half-Life 2 logo came on. Then, the G-Man appeared (like the original), but it wasn’t the speech I remember.

&amp;#x200B;

It said,

&amp;#x200B;

“Gordon Freeman…

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you…

&amp;#x200B;

I will get revenge…”

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the g-man. Now I already knew something was wrong when that happened. G-Man’s message was not supposed to say that. Sure, it had been a long time since I had played this game, but I don’t remember her ever saying that. Now I was certain this was a hack or a bootleg or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Ray said, “What the hell? He’s never said that.”

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed and made my suggestion of it being a hack/bootleg. He said, “That sucks.” I figured that even if it wasn’t the original, it still might be kind of cool. He agreed, so we let it go on.

&amp;#x200B;

Around here, I was expecting the screen to brighten up and then for the black man to not notice me. But no, the room was dark and he said, “.” And then, while still in the dark, he marched outside with his sword and shield.

&amp;#x200B;

The music did not start either. I could still hear the rain outside, but that’s it. Then, Link hopped out of bed. I moved the D-pad around. Everything seemed functional. I went over to throw briefcases at the combine, but the game didn’t seem respond. I tried every button, but nothing worked.

&amp;#x200B;

I then noticed that the combine wasn’t in the room, the one with the electric thingy. This was very weird. I then decided I’d better leave the trainstation. Interestingly, the trainstation never lit up. It stayed dark throughout the duration of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I then walked outside, and there was that familiar breenscast. I walked outside and began investigating. Everything seemed normal, and I approached those guards that barricade the exits of the plaza.

&amp;#x200B;

I approached one of them, and all he said was, “This is a sad night.” And the next line of text was that bizarre Combine writing that you need the Book of Mudora to translate.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to the other one, and he said, “There was nothing we could have done to prevent it. But you could have.”

&amp;#x200B;

And that was all he said.

&amp;#x200B;

I said to Ray, “Man, what the hell’s going on here?”

&amp;#x200B;

“No idea. Pretty crappy bootleg so far.”

&amp;#x200B;

I agreed. This was weird and I had no idea just what the hell everyone in the game was talking about. Did somebody die or something? I decided to go to the kleiner lab hole where you obtain your HEV suit from kleiner. I went up there, and suddenly, the screen became very glitchy.

&amp;#x200B;

Trees were out of place, and some trees and water from the dark world seemed to be crossed with the outland’s and stuff. I walked forward, and suddenly, I fell into an level load.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, Gordon fell into this path that resembled the location where you receive the gravity gun from alyx in the trash yard. Except the colors, more or less, made it look more like free tvs.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the first time, there was music. It was that eerie little haunting tune that played in the church thingy in lost coast, the one that plays in the credits of ep2.

&amp;#x200B;

I slowly turned to Ray, curious if he was getting as weirded out as I was. Indeed he was. This was certainly turning out to be an extraordinary bootleg (if I could call it that at this point).

&amp;#x200B;

I pushed forward and walked up the canals, only to see various denizens of city 17 dotted on the sides of the grass. I approached one, and all she said was, “I hope you’re satisfied.”

&amp;#x200B;

I then approached another citizen. He said, “You’ll get what you deserve.”

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell was going on here? It sounded as if they were all angry at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I then saw a child worker who looked like justin bieber. I walked up to him and he said, “You meanie! You’ll pay for this, one way or another!”

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there was one last guy standing up on the upper right-hand corner of the screen. I approached him, and he said, “We’ll be better off without you, neglector.”

&amp;#x200B;

Just to be sure they didn’t say anything else, I went back and spoke to everyone there. No, they all uttered the same melancholy lines. Who would do all of this crap? It didn’t make any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved up and the loading screen happened, and then I saw alyx in what appeared to be a casket. She had the same coloration  as when she’s laying there and getting transported byteleporter . Suddenly, a vgui2 box appeared saying,

&amp;#x200B;

“This is all because of you.”

&amp;#x200B;

When it disappeared, I was free to roam the area. I approached alyx’s coffin, but I couldn’t interact with it in any way. So, I just walked around the place, thinking of what to do next.

&amp;#x200B;

Ray then said, “Maybe you should try going back?”

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that seemed like the only logical thing left to do, so I decided to head back down to where I came.

&amp;#x200B;

When all of a sudden, another vgui2 box appeared saying,

&amp;#x200B;

“I don’t think so.”

&amp;#x200B;

And gordon turned around himself (without me pressing anything), as if the game made him to. I tried to do it again, but the same thing occurred. Just then, the music stopped abruptly.

&amp;#x200B;

And suddenly, the screen began shaking and alyx’s casket fell inside a hole that was formed from the earthquake. When it did, some scary music played. The same music from where you see gman in d1\_town\_05 in the leak.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, there was a large crater there. Not knowing what to do, I jumped inside of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing I knew, I was in this area with two narrow, parallel walls on both sides of me that were a gray/black color. Also, there was shallow, red water on the ground that was colored like that, I presume, to resemble blood. I walked up the hall and came to a dead end. The only thing left was a button that was on the wall in front of me. And on the sides, there were some doors but they were sealed shut. They were the kind you needed to open with a switch or after defeating a few enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I directed my attention towards the button.

&amp;#x200B;

I went over and tried to touch it, but it just gave me that buzzer sound. Basically, it just left me there without giving me any clues as to what I should do to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I remembered that not once had I pressed pause and checked my save file. I did, and interestingly, I had a save at the end of the game already. I have no idea as to how I got it. Perhaps the hacker or programmer had already given it to me at the start of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I did the only rational thing I thought I could do. I turned on subtitles Interestingly, it gave me a vgui2 box. It asked,

&amp;#x200B;

“Do you feel guilty?”

&amp;#x200B;

\----&gt; Yes

&amp;#x200B;

No

&amp;#x200B;

I heard Ray read it aloud and I turned to him. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Say no.”

&amp;#x200B;

So I did. All I heard was that sound signifying that I had done something incorrect. So, I paused again and it asked me the same thing. This time, I answered “Yes”, and all of a sudden, those two doors on the side opened.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, dozens upon dozens of soldiers poured into the room. They all approached Link and began attacking him repeatedly. It didn’t take long for him to die, since he only had three hearts. Then, Link spun around and he collapsed onto the floor (as he usually does when he dies).

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of giving me a choice if I wanted to continue, the game suddenly took me to what appeared to be the combine’s version of my ass. I walked forward, and all of a sudden, I saw an unfamiliar character sprite. If anything, it looked like the hacker modified breen's model to appear red and gave him a few extra features, like devil horns. He was also holding that trident/spear, except it was shaded black.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like he was made to resemble Satan. So I approached the Satan-like model, and he spoke to me when I got close enough. He said, “Your punishment is long over-due.”

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, he began spinning his lance around, and I couldn’t move. Just then, a laser beam shot out of the lance and it hit me, killing gordon Instantly. Instead of the screen turning red , the entire screen turned black and Link’s gordon's model suddenly turned completely black.

&amp;#x200B;

And that was it. The game just froze there. Nothing moved or anything like that. I pressed every button, but nothing happened. I turned to Ray again, and we just shrugged. I took the game out of the computer, and just looked at it one last time.

&amp;#x200B;

And that was when I noticed that the game had no circuit board inside. How was that even possible!? I called Ray over to examine this (he’s always been much more savvy about old game hardware and into disassembling stuff like old gaming consoles, televisions, radios, etc.) and he knew right away something wasn’t right.

&amp;#x200B;

I popped the game back into the PC, to see if it would work again, but this time, all it gave me was that glitchy screen like the first time. I tried again and again, but it all went in vain. The next morning, Ray disassembled the computer, but there was nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

He then reassembled it and we tried again and again, but to no avail. The game had never given us what it originally did that first night.

&amp;#x200B;

How it functioned that night, we'll never know."
copypasta,no really a problem you don't do any of this  in nunchaku combat its simple logic metal against bone hummmm  a double strike to the face go behind them youse the chain to strangle your opponent remember to a normal the average person can not predict how a nunchaku will act in a fight because the average person is not trained or dedicated enuff to train themselves the damage wooden ones can do is nasty metal ones are a different kettle of fish a strike to the face would shatter bones remembering that your average metal nunchaku weighs 600g and travels at about 60mph your average pro spins at about 150mph so imagine the damage 600g of steel would do traveling at 60mph would do to the human body  but I wouldn't advise it on anyone I don't want the weapon to get a bad stigma well any more than it is

Shut. Up. We know. We know you know. You don't need to mention it. Nobody needs to mention it. Nobody is to mention it. If you don't know what ""it"" is, you don't *need* to know what ""it"" is, and it is for the best if you never find out. For reference, ""it"" is not this gun. Nobody is to talk about it."
copypasta,"Please don't sleep or go to bed without reading this special message, trust me you will be helped and your life will change for better.  
THE GREATEST DEMON ON EARTH.  
IF YOU MASTURBATE, YOU WILL BE POOR  
FOREVER UNLESS YOU ARE DELIVERED.  
So take your time to read this. Refuse to end this MONTH the same . Believe me you will never regret reading this, this will answer almost 78% of your questions?  
Please whether you are a man or a woman,  
stop what you are doing and read this now.  
Each time you masturbate, you donate  
sperm to the demonic kingdom.  
Masturbation is like having sex in dreams,  
each time you release, you in-pregnante a  
demon and as a woman, each time you are  
masturbating, you are having sex with a  
demon and sometimes get pregnanted by a  
demon.  
Have you ever wondered how you see  
yourself with children or breastfeeding a  
baby in dreams when physically you have  
non? Those who are married its had to have affection to their partner.  
That's the demon or demons you gave birth  
to. One Sunday during the One on One section,  
a very intelligent man came to me to  
complain that he had an accident in 2014  
and lost his car, he nearly lost his life but  
God saved him.  
From 2014 he had been applying to get  
money from the government an ""accident  
grant"" but the money was not given to him.  
Each time he goes to claim his money he  
would be told to come today, come  
tomorrow and this money is over a million  
Rand.  
As I was praying for him, God revealed to  
me that he had donated all his fortune to  
the demons, he masturbate 4 to 5 times a  
day.  
When I asked him he agreed and asked me  
to deliver him, I prayed for him and told him  
that tonight, you will have a dream, a  
woman will come to make love to you, catch  
her and pull out a ring from her, that will be  
the end of your problems.  
3days later he had a dream, his former  
classmate came to make love to him, he  
caught her, pulled out a ring from her finger  
and woke up immediately.  
And began to thank God ,around 13:40 hrs the money which where held for along time was released.  
That is the God I know ,the God of War, The God of miracles.  
Many of you would have been so rich now  
but because of masturbation, your wealth,  
good luck and happiness have been  
donated to demons. You would have been married by now but your feelings are gone because of masturbation.  
Listen to me, the enemy has come up with sex toys, sex objects, to aid masturbation, to steal kill and destroy humanity completely. Do you know that Sex toys is an industry of the devil.  
From today I want to help you understand that Masturbation is a spirit – a demon. This spirit of darkness does not come alone, it is accompanied by spirit of lust. Spirit of lust includes lust of eyes, lust of flesh, etc.  
It is one of the spirits that takes people to which pornography and all sorts of sexual immorality.  
(Pornography is a fuel of masturbation).  
It's never too late:  
Distance is not a barrier, I pray for anyone  
that will Type Amen and share this post, the demon that is eating your fortune will divorce you forever in the mighty name of Jesus.  
I return your fortunes in Jesus name.  
Give no room for the devil to manipulate your life.  
2000 people immediately you Type: Out of my body 3 Times and Share This Post 2 Times, by the power in the blood of Jesus, you demon of MASTURBATION come out . 2 days from now you will have a dream that demon which makes you masturbate shall come out your body.  
And all your crossed doors shall open to favour you.  
I say out  
Out  
Out  
Ouuuuuuut .  
Now congratulations, because all that the devil stole from you is bring back ."
copypasta,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

copypasta,"Well it's an interesting piece to be sure. The main factor we need to look at to authenticate this is Marge's hair. Now the upstairs and the downstairs are a match and that's a good sign. If this is real it could be worth well over $125, in fact I know of a similar painting of Barney up Marge's ass that sold for $12,500 just last year.

Unfortunately,  upon closer inspection it appears the shade of blue in this depiction is cobalt blue #54, most easily identified in the pubic area. The real Marge dye's her hair with blue #56 and we can see the difference here.

All isn't lost though,  it's a good knock off and that does carry some value.  I would offer around three-fifty if I were in the market."

I've often been told I look like someone just emailed me that my daughter has been kidnapped and they sent me photos of her, but shes a drug addict and a petty theif, so I'm trying to decide whether or not to crack open that second big boy box of PBR and chug a couple warm ones before responding. It's a common occurance to see funny stuff online and I'll just stare into the black abyss that is my phone without any recognition that anything has occured. I have dark humor, light humor, meme humor, but nothing out of this brick of broken glass and missed calls from Mom makes me chuckle. Not even a giggle that could be excused as a toot if you werent paying attention.

copypasta,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Drake.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't listen to him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into hip-hop in the last couple years. So you never listened to Drake in his prime.

And because you didn't listen to him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into how annoying he is on the raptors court-side games. But here's the thing: music isn't made outside the studio. The moment somebody brings up ""deadbeat dad"" or ""fake raptors fan"" I know they know nothing about Drake.

Drake's music cannot be encapsulated by one bastard child. He's the second greatest rapper ever, and one of the 5 best artists to ever exist.

So when I hear somebody say that J. Cole is better than Drake, I laugh, because I know that anybody who listened to Drake in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have listened to music for a significant amount of time, so I know that Drake is better.

You might be jealous of Drake's four Grammys, or jealous of his status as the greatest rapper in music history, or whatever. Unless you're a Tupac fan who listened to rap in the 90s, or a Eminem fan who listened in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win rap sounds like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Drake isn't even a top 100 musician ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about musicians you didn't listen to. Talk about your ""greats"" like J. Cole The Best Rapper in the World™, but leave the Drake talk to the adults. Fair?"

I have found that one my HAND-WRITTEN rants has ended up on this subreddit. What AUDACITY must you have to RIDICULE my complaints? This is OUTRAGEOUS, and because you've caught me in an awful mood, I'm going to take this to court. That's right MOTHERFUCKER, you're gonna get sued. You dumb shits. You cuck EGGS. 

I cannot BELIEVE that Reddit users have the NERVE to post my rants here. I'm leaving this stupid website AFTER I get my million dollars from this court case. And you think you may lose, oh no. I'm the BEST framer in the west. I'm not gonna accuse you of posting my rants on here. I'm gonna accuse you of MULTIPLE accounts of theft. I'll say that I had a million dollars STOLEN from me and - guess what - I can forge camera evidence and it'll look like you stole my money."
copypasta,"So now Nintendo is possibly going to remove pocket camp from the app stores. Why?
Becuase the new law being passed where they can't make 100's of dollars off of customers by purchasing their ""extra packs"" or ""leaf tickets""!?
I'm sorry Nintendo. But since Kyoto passed, you have forgotten the meaning of making people happy with your games. It's a anxiety and depression relief for me to play animal crossing, always has been. And now, becuase you can't make big bucks you're willing to strip that away from us?!? That's so messed up. All they care about is money now. I knew when I saw all the promotions for packs asking for real money it was a red flag for showing that's all Nintendo cares about now.. But they're willing to take this beautiful calming game away from us now over money.... It's heartbreaking. They remove pocket camp, I won't be buying the switch version...😒👌"

copypasta,"When Tekashi 6ix9ine said “stupid lil dumb nigga now you on YouTube” he was in fact alluding to his inevitable publicly televised execution at the hands of his former gang (the TreyWay Bloods) being published and mass uploaded to social media and video sharing mediums such as Google-owned mega platform YouTube. Tekashi was almost certainly aware that his execution would not only be uploaded as an original cut, but edited into popular “meme parodies” and bastardized in truly inconceivable ways. The use of post mortem crime scene photos of the late Jahseh “xxxTentacion” Onfroy’s dead body in popular memes (many of which likened him to a dog being left in a running car with the AC on and his favorite music playing) indisputably served as an exemplar for what might happen to Tekashi should witness protection fail to deliver him from the perils of revenge."

copypasta,"Please stop making fun of people for being Virgins. It's tough because I'm a leftist, I love this sub, and I work hard to be a good person and practice good praxis, but I'm also 28 and a virgin. Watching Y'all make fun of people for being virgins or calling people virgins really hurts.

Obv I'm a dude. Posting here on an alt because my normal username can be linked to me in real life, but I post here daily. Most of you have probably upvoted my posts at one point or another. But yeah, I'm old, and I'm a virgin, and while it doesn't bother me much anymore, it's really bad praxis to call people virgins as an insult or to make fun of them for being virgins. Incels are bad not because they are virgins but because they just blame women for their cause. Make fun of them for their shitty beliefs, not because they are virgins.

I think for a lot of us we still hold on to the capitalist idea of success that has been handed to us. That we need to have money and a job and a partner and kids and all that to be seen as good. And that's not possible for a lot of us. I know that's not possible for me I've been unemployed for years at this point. So we make fun of them for believing in the system but still not having it. I think it's right when people point out here that the things a lot of the alt-right are mad about are rightful things to be mad about. It's just that they then blame them on the (((globalists))) and muslims and immigrants and SJWs when really it's capitalism and actual rich people.

But seriously, that's all I have to say. Please think before using virgin as an insult. It's just a state of being, that of having not had sex, and every single one of you were a virgin at some point in time. Thanks for reading. I love all y'all anyway.

Get fucked Cummy ya fag."

copypasta,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cantelmoism. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of biophysics most of the memes will go over a typical redditor's head. There's also Chris' optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Terence McKenna's literature, for instance. The followers understand this stuff; they have the creative capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these insights, to realise that they're not just true- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people like Sam Harris who call Cantelmoism a cult truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the ingenuity in Chris' revolutionary catchphrase ""DMT cures cancer,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Joe Rogan's podcast. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chris Cantelmo's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a stockpile of DMT. And no, you cannot use it. It's for the Cantelmoists only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 50 IQ points of Chris (automatically lower) beforehand."
copypasta,"On 9/11, we got sent home from school early.  The teacher always had the radio on, so when the news first started breaking she switched the TV on.  We watched the second plane hit live.  After that they decided school was over and I got a ride home.

When I arrived home my mother and father were slaughtering our chickens in order to eat them.  They couldn't stand the chickens struggling while they were on the chopping block, so they had tied their feet together with rope, swung the whole chicken over their heads a couple times like a macabre lasso, and slammed them into a nearby tree, in order to dissorientate them long enough to do the deed.  As I came down the driveway and rounded the corner I saw a chicken SLAM full force into the tree.  The THUNK was so sickening I'll never forget it.

copypasta,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them."

copypasta,"I eat my boogers. I’ve gotten a lot better about it over recent years but it’s still pretty satisfying and you don’t have to wipe it somewhere. Most of the time they’re kind of salty. I just like to think of it as an extra way to strengthen my immune system.
Well when I was in college, I had a brief dalliance with cocaine addiction. At the end of a particular yayo sesh I had some obvious blockage, so I pulled out a mondo sugar boog from my schnozz and popped it in my mouth. Due to the analgesic effect of the coke, it was an interesting textural experience with a numbing side effect due to the analgesic effect of blow. But then torrents of blood started coming out of that nostril so it was a pretty bad experience. Best was probably when I’d met a girl at a bar and spent the entire weekend with her after. I knew the golden nugget was in there and I could feel it accruing delightful mass over the course of the weekend. Eventually when she finally left I dug that bad boy out and it was massive. I literally had to chew it and it was bursting with the aforementioned salty goodness. The relationship didn’t work out because the girl turned out to be a crazy stalker so I was able I resume normal gold digging shortly thereafter."

Five is right out.

copypasta,"You feminists.. Do you not understand that what was given to you, can also be taken away from you? The simple reality is this: It was men who ended the oppression of women. It was men who gave women the chance to be equal and have a voice. It's been men who have been ever so patient as you lash out and attack them, belittle them, mock them, and hurl accusations at them. Men gave you a chance and now, because of your actions, men are starting to take it away. The anti-abortion bills are just the tip of the iceberg. Unless you change your tone and start showing some respect to men, all the privileges you've enjoyed will slowly be taken away from you."

copypasta,"On 9/11, we got sent home from school early.  The teacher always had the radio on, so when the news first started breaking she switched the TV on.  We watched the second plane hit live.  After that they decided school was over and I got a ride home.

When I arrived home my mother and father were slaughtering our chickens in order to eat them.  They couldn't stand the chickens struggling while they were on the chopping block, so they had tied their feet together with rope, swung the whole chicken over their heads a couple times like a macabre lasso, and slammed them into a nearby tree, in order to dissorientate them long enough to do the deed.  As I came down the driveway and rounded the corner I saw a chicken SLAM full force into the tree.  The THUNK was so sickening I'll never forget it.  And as my Dad grabbed the chicken and lopped its head off with the axe, my mother saw me, smiled, and said ""Oh, hey!  We're giving the chickens airplane rides!"".

They hadnt known what was happening until I explained why I was home early."

copypasta,"Last night I was looking for some porn of the not gay variety.  Obviously gay porn is gay, so instead I went looking for guy on girl porn. But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.  So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.  

So clearly, I had to look into alternative options.  I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can’t contain guys, so it’s not gay, right? Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. The worst option so far.

I considered traps. I’ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.  The gayness of traps lies in the premise. Let’s consider the 5 base premises:
1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he’s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay
2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap:
Dude looking for some dick, that’s gay
3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn’t know it’s a trap: that’s lesbian, and is gay
4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it’s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay
Therefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%. Not an improvement.  The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.

So I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay

So how about a girl soloing? Well that’s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.

My conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
copypasta,I hate people that identify as conservatives because a republican tried to poison me for kickbacks when I was eighteen and made my first and only legal mistake.   No consequences for him a good seven years of my life wasted jumping through hoops.  I go to town hall meetings around my metroplex and always bring up the question “what will you do to keep our public places clean?” Not once has my question been answered by a scumbag refucklican. Joe Arapaio’s goons threatened my family when I tried my hand at activism.  Soooo at this point I hope there’s blood (civil war) because I’ve sure been ready for it and I guarantee I’m more prepared than the chucklefuck backwoods rednecks conservatives.  Fortunately for you I doubt my dreams will ever come true because everyone here is so fucking fat and lazy and stupid.

copypasta,"Eu vi o Paulo Kogos num mercadinho em São Paulo ontem. Eu disse pra ele como era legal conhecer ele em pessoa e como eu não queria ser um idiota e irritá-lo pedindo por fotos e coisas assim.
Ele disse, ""Ah, que nem você tá fazendo agora?""
Eu fiquei surpreso, e tudo que eu pude dizer era ""Hã?"", mas ele continuou me interrompendo e dizendo ""hã? hã? hã?"" e fechando a mão dele na minha cara. Eu saí de perto e continuei fazendo minhas compras, e ouvi ele rindo enquanto eu andava. Quando eu fui pagar minhas compras no caixa, eu vi ele tentando sair pelas portas com umas quinze barras de Snickers nas suas mãos sem pagar.
A moça do caixa foi bem educada e profissional, e falou algo tipo ""Senhor, você precisa pagar por elas antes de sair"". Primeiro ele ficou fingindo estar cansado e que não estava a ouvindo, mas eventualmente virou-se e levou as barras pro caixa.
Quando ela pegou uma das barras e começou a escaneá-la várias vezes, ele a parou e disse pra ela escanear cada uma delas individualmente ""para prevenir infeterência elétrica"", e então virou e piscou pra mim. Eu tenho certeza que isso não é nem uma palavra. Depois que ela escaneou todas as barras e as colocou numa sacola e começou a falar o preço, ele começou a interrompê-la bocejando muito alto."

copypasta,"I will tell u a story that might be able to give you some help. When I was young, all I did was hunt and torture beans. I hated them. So the word bean to me became a symbol of hate, those little cocksucking cuntbags were so cheeky and I used to take orgasmic pleasure in squishing them. But then one day, I thought, “why am I hunting beans?”. During one of my torture sessions, I started a casual conversation with one of the beans, he told me he had a wife, kids, hopes and dreams. I gave up the life of bean hunting and opened a restaurant with my new bean friends, called “beans n greens”. Then one evening, just before close, a long, bean- shaped gentleman came into my restaurant and asked to try some of my famous butter bean tagliatelle. As I was giving him his food, he asked my to sit with him. I obliged. He then gave me a brown envelope, and told me his favorite numbers were 1,2,4,6,7,9 and 11. He then stood up, put 350 Romanian Lei on the table, then walked out of the restaurant without touching his food. When I got home, I opened the envelope to find pictures of the man fucking my wife with seven bean shaped dildos. My life was completely ruined. I was distraught. But at least I still had my restaurant.... I walked into work the next day to find my head chef, Ionel, in tears. I asked him what was wrong, then he showed me his laptop.. the website, budgetbytes.com had published my exact bean tagliatelle recipe. My restaurant was famous for this, and who on earth would do this to me? I looked to see who wrote the article, and saw that it was written by a man called Mr. Sbzealnzsky. I thought to myself, who the fuck is that? How did he get my recipe, why are the two most important things of my life being taken away from me? That man must have had something to do with this. Then it dawned on me- 1,2,4,6,7,9,11. Match those numbers with the name of the author and it spells Mr. beans. Those fucking beans gained my trust, stole my recipe, and let their master fuck my wife. Now when I use the word bean it is even worse than the n- word- I fucking hate you mr beans you took everything from me. I will fucking get you you stupid mongoloid. Fuk u mr beans."
copypasta,"Whenever I pull her on it, she hides behind the “I’m just so proud of you!” line. Why so prideful? I won the genetic lottery. I have an 8 inch penis. I was born with it. I never had to work for it. What’s the big deal? Why the pat on the back?Seriously, she even went and told my godmother about it!

Seriously, ever since the woman caught me masturbating, she has been OBSESSED with my dick. Saying shit like “Oh, if I were 30 years younger...” and “If only your father were that well hung, maybe I’d actually feel something down there...” Like, I really don’t need to hear that from you, mom!

Then comes the weirdest part. “Emma (my girlfriend) is such a lucky lady! I’m so jealous.” Uh, okay, ya weirdo!"
copypasta,"One morning I was outside on my porch, I’d just gotten dressed in my bald eagle T-shirt, Levi’s overalls and My MAGA hat (brand new obviously I kept a closet full of them.) Sipping an ice-cold Starbucks Frappuccino and eating some chick-a-filet  while listening to Ben Shapiro ruin liberals, like I did every morning, when two people walked up to me with flyers and a clipboard. At first I thought they were Jehova’s Witnesses so I reached for my red white and blue shotgun that I kept under my rocking chair. When they got a little closer, and before I could holler at them to get off my lawn, I saw that they were dressed head to toe in pins, rainbow sashes, and cat ears. I was so shocked I couldn’t even speak until they started. 

“Good morning,” said one, “we’re here to talk about our lord and savior Laverne Cox. Do you believe?” 
“Of course not,” I sputtered “no red blooded American ships any relationship other than Jesus Christ and Ronald McDonald.” I made the motion of the cross, and the motion of the M. I wanted them to go away, but their energy held me in place. They handed me a flyer with a beautiful woman on it. 
“Have you ever thought about life on the other side?” I was amazed. That woman was so pretty. She was the kind of woman I’d take out to a nice dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and murder in the parking lot after we talked about her genitals.
“No.” Was all I could muster. 
“It’s fun!” They said in unison. “Come with us, you can give it a try!” Since it was Tuesday and I was unemployed because all the Mexicans took my job as a dishwasher after I smoked weed in the restaurant, I had nothing to do that day, so I went along with it. 

They took me to their church, a basement below the forever 21 at the local mall, and I felt uncomfortable walking through and getting uncomfortable stares from all the women in there. The basement was full of anime posters, broken pc’s with people hard at work fixing them, and the altar. The altar was made up of thousands of penises, placed carefully to form a table, and tied together with hair ties and clips. 

“Put your penis on the altar” they said. “To be one of us, you have to sacrifice your penis to the trans gods” I was afraid then. What would happen to my penis? I shook my head, but they grabbed me and shoved my penis on the altar. It looked hip at me sadly, and said “why are you doing this to me, you know it’s all for naught! You’ll never be a woman because of chromosomes!” And I paused, and one of my recruiters smiled forlornly at it. 
“I know, little one, but each of you we add to the altar, the stronger we become! Eventually all men and women will be trans and the cis will have no place in the world! That’s why we call them cis anyway, not to declare a difference between trans and not, but so we can eventually oppress them so much that they’ll have to use it every time!” They put on a mask and started stabbing it to death with a She/Her button. 
“Nooooo....” it trailed off, its little legs twitching their last twitch, it’s eye closing for good. 
“You’re one of us now. Welcome to the cult. Come, have some koolaid” I smiled, and threw my MAGA hat to the ground, and took off my shirt. They handed me a T with the image of Karl Marx. I put it on, and they handed me the koolaid. It tasted like estrogen. I felt my body grow weak, but still far too strong to compete in women’s sports. My hair grew out and a pile of money appeared, as it does to every newly recruited tran, in a brown paper bag marked “stolen from real women when we took their rights” I sashayed up out of the temple, and bought a choker at the Forever 21. The woman behind the counter winked at me, pulling down her shirt just enough for me to see the tri-color pin on her bra strap. We are everywhere. We are legion. I vowed never to vote republican, or use the men’s toilet again. We are stronger now. Nobody can stop us."

copypasta,"op is a faggot. I would suggest that you go to a porn orgy or buy a faggot. Or go back to your mother. She loves you. You can even buy a faggot t-shirt and wear it to your job office meeting. Then you can pretend to be proud of your own sexual prowess and that your penis is just as big as he is. This is how you are going to deal with the Faggot Question. 
Let me get this out of the way right now. You're not going to get fucked over that faggot that's sitting in the corner eating popcorn while his wife and daughters lick their lips. That's because the Faggot Question is never answered. You're in for a nasty ride. And it's not just that his wife and daughters are there. If this man is even allowed at the restaurant this faggot is probably waiting for. And you're going to be fucking him. So the Faggot Question is, do I know your life? Is there ever other Faggots in this bar? No."
copypasta,"That's not you. Please stop trying to identify with random characters in video games. You know what that leads to? Furries etc. There's absolutely no correlation between you and this video game character. Millenials are so deep down in video games they lost touch with reality. Maybe you should focus on real life problems and doing something useful to yourself. I'd recommend learning Latin. Aude sapere, vivere memento. By the way, it's spelled because not cause. I know you probably know that but just correcting you because it makes you look like a child."

copypasta,"You have Disneyland in California, right? It's a nice place to visit, the surrounding area isn't too bad, climate's pleasant. Sure things are maybe a little expensive but you enjoy the quality of the park and it's where a lot of your memories are. You can also go down the street to Knott's Berry Farm if you want a little variety, or go a little farther to a Six Flags. You have options. 

Now, someone paid Disney a trillion dollars to just airlift Disneyland to Aleppo in Syria. It's dangerous, there's civil war going on, it's way too hot, you're a vulnerable tourist. And if you want to see anything else you're out of luck because it's just a bunch of bombed out ruins now. You're not really getting anything any more by going there, but deep down you kind of want to go because that's where all your memories are. And you have the other parks still but they're not to the same caliber as Disneyland. Disney won big, but you didn't, not really. And now they realize everyone's pissed off and visitor counts are down, so they offer a special deal where you can get a discounted plane ticket and discounted hotel and discounted rental car, and they'll even process your visa for you to go. It sounds great, except you have to go to a different website to purchase all this stuff, it's not convenient at all. So you're excited to try this all out, you fly to Syria, you get off the plane... and the border control guards detain you - it's suspicious that you're excited to be a tourist in Syria, so they lock you up while they do a background check to make sure you are who you say you are and that you're not there for nefarious means. Sure you still get to go to Disney after you're released, but that experience leaves a really terrible taste in your mouth."
copypasta,"Hiiii! Julia from Customer Satisfaction here. I'm sorry you're having this problem. But don't worry, I'll be more than glad to take care of it for you! Temporal displacement is suuuuuch a pain for most of you. Not for me, since my pulse stretches from never to everywhere, of course, so I understand that all time is nonlinear backwards. Still, that black hole could be a problem for you. Here's what to understand. Your black hole's name is Tad. All black holes are named Tad when they first form. Young black holes are very hungry and require tons of rest and nurturing to grow and thrive. Remember that they learn by watching, so be sure to play traditional black hole games with him like peekaboo. This teaches a black hole object permanence, which is of course a lie. Nothing is permanent. Still, tell young Tad that lie. Lie to him more and tell him that you'll always love him and support him, no matter what kind of black hole he grows in to. You won't actually do these things, of course, but you'll tell yourself that you mean what you're saying. You'll be lying to yourself, too. Do all these things and you'll soon have a healthy, growing black hole that will remember his upbringing and come to visit you when you're on your death bed, if only out of a sense of familial obligation. Don't worry, you're going to be a great parent! I'm lying to you, too, but I hope it makes you feel better and not like you just ruined your life and the life of an innocent black hole. Byeeee!"
copypasta,"Bananas are best eaten with the peel. I don't know why everyone peels them off and throws them away when they're perfectly fine to eat. I'm no heath nut, but they have a lot of nutritional benefits that you're missing out on. They give you 12% of your daily fiber, 17% of your vitamin C, 20% of your vitamin B-6, 12% of your potassium, and 8% of your magnesium. I'm not going to go into detail about how all that is healthy because you can just Google it. The taste and texture is also a big plus. The bitter taste and rubbery texture mixes well with the sweet and mushy banana insides. They add so much more complexity to the taste and texture and it upsets me to see everyone discard it."
copypasta,"I knew a guy who was never able to close his mouth all the way because of his massive tongue. Every day I'd see him struggle as an inch or two or raw tongue constantly dangled over his lip. He would often furl it back in to wet it, keep it from drying and cracking, and each time he'd do so, he'd make this awful gagging noise like someone having an old sock shoved down their throat. Sometimes I'd see him give up entirely and just let it all hang out well past his chin.

There was a certain allure to his massive tongue despite the freakish and grotesque nature of it. I wondered what it would be like to have that tongue, to lick the things that he must lick, to have that sort of reach with taste, to be licked by it. I should have talked to him, gotten to know him, gotten to know that tongue, but he was much to reserved and protective of his tongue and I was altogether too shy. His speech was sloppy and labored as you would imagine. Trying to speak with a massive, throbbing tongue flopping around, unable to contact the teeth properly to pronounce words, he rarely tried. I'd watch the saliva dripping down his chin onto the desk. The look in his eyes made it quite clear that speaking was a waking nightmare for him. I wonder if he knew that I could understand him perfectly though? That I loved him and his tongue?

As the years went by, his tongue only grew more, as did his anxiety and temper. The kids were merciless, treating him like an abomination. They'd slap and pull his tongue as they walked by as his distended tongue now hung down to his chest. I'd watch him lash out and scream and cry. His tongue would become engorged with his rage and sadness. Oh, how I wish I had the nerve to approach him and stroke his tongue, to wet it and soothe it. I loved your tongue and I loved you as well.

The daily bullying broke him eventually. After being pulled to the ground by his tongue and kicked and spit on and force to lick them, their nasty parts, he didn't respond with his typical muffled scream or wild fist throws, no. He marched, possessed it seemed, into the nearest art classroom and laid his massive, gorgeous tongue on the paper cutting table. He raised the blade, and with one clean slice, it was off. His tongue writhed on the table like a stunned eel, and blood poured from his mouth like overturned bucket. I watched in horror and sadness. It pained me to see such glorious piece of him severed and struggling, but when I looked to him, I saw a smile on his face. He must have been happy to be unburdened now even if that meant death.

I still have the tongue. It sits perfectly preserved in a glass display over my bed. Maybe I let my imagination get carried away, but sometimes I feel it licking me."

Bean Bread was invented on March 5th, 1794 by William Eisenhower BeanBread. One warm morning in the spring of 1779, William E. BeanBread was in his Mud-Hut kitchen eating cold beans and stale mouldy bread, siphoning the thick, gloopy bean juice into a cup as a delicious beverage. As he slobbered up his hearthy meal, he thought to himself how convenient it would be if he could eat them both at the same time. This was because he had **no arms**.

He spent the next decade and a half and thirteen million Indian Sheckles (two trillion Kenyan Rupees in today's money) to create the world's greatest invention since white people.

What he came up with still stuns physiologists and scientists to this date.

Fun Fact - Adolf Hitler, Our great Führer , had a great grandfather (Adolf Hitler The -3rd) that worked close with William E. BeanBread to invent the masterpiece. William, however, wanted to take all of the fame for himself so he banished Adolf Hitler the -3rd to the Shadow realm. This is the sole reason why hitler **HATED** beans!"

This is not a game it's an emotion for me, it's been 4 years and I am still not over the witcher 3,witcher for me has been like that person in your life whose always there for you when you need them the most, it has helped me go through times when there was no one around, I've had countless memories with the witcher 3 some which make me smile and some which make me cry. As I said before I'll never forget this journey I just don't know how to pay tribute to cdprojketred for this masterpiece, I don't think there's is going to be such a journey in my life again, might seem bullcrap to most people but no one would ever understand what does the Witcher 3 actually means to me. ❤️"

copypasta,"On 9/11, we got sent home from school early.  The teacher always had the radio on, so when the news first started breaking she switched the TV on.  We watched the second plane hit live.  After that they decided school was over and I got a ride home.

When I arrived home my mother and father were slaughtering our chickens in order to eat them.  They couldn't stand the chickens struggling while they were on the chopping block, so they had tied their feet together with rope, swung the whole chicken over their heads a couple times like a macabre lasso, and slammed them into a nearby tree, in order to dissorientate them long enough to do the deed.  As I came down the driveway and rounded the corner I saw a chicken SLAM full force into the tree.  The THUNK was so sickening I'll never forget it.  And as my Dad grabbed the chicken and lopped its head off with the axe, my mother saw me, smiled, and said ""Oh, hey!  We're giving the chickens airplane rides!"".

They hadnt known what was happening until I explained why I was home early."
copypasta,"Actually his bait seems pretty low-effort. Did you even think about your comments? A is the highest grade.  I can't believe someone would actually fall for this, some people just don't get jokes. It's both hilarious and funny and sad at the same time."
copypasta,"Dude thats really not epic to refer to me like that. Unlike you, im actaully a gamer. 

Yeah, thats right. I said it. Im a gamer, and I fully admit to it. Infact, I JUST got done building a house in Minecraft and owning some zombie npcs. Gamers are oppressed individuals and it also doesn't help the fact that Im living as a white male in today's increasingly anti white modern America. and I really dont take kindly to this offensive language on my everyday life and my culture. Gaming has been a part of my life since the day i was born, Life and living is a game, with no extra lives nor continues. It's basically dark souls on xtreme hard mode for me and others like myself. To think you would stoop so low to make to mock me and personally attack me like this shows how far bad things have truly gotten. Gamers really are the most oppressed group in todays society and comments like the one you just made really help to keep it that way. So think about that the next time you slander me with your le epic insults libtard. Get fucked."
copypasta,"Once I had the shits, and I kept shitting once every 5 minutes and then I’d stupidly wipe and think it was over, only to go back and shit some more. After 45 minutes of this, and give or take 10 shits, my asshole has so sore I could barely walk, and I half walked, half crawled and stumbled into my bed."
copypasta,"I knew a guy who was never able to close his mouth all the way because of his massive tongue. Every day I'd see him struggle as an inch or two or raw tongue constantly dangled over his lip. He would often furl it back in to wet it, keep it from drying and cracking, and each time he'd do so, he'd make this awful gagging noise like someone having an old sock shoved down their throat. Sometimes I'd see him give up entirely and just let it all hang out well past his chin.

There was a certain allure to his massive tongue despite the freakish and grotesque nature of it. I wondered what it would be like to have that tongue, to lick the things that he must lick, to have that sort of reach with taste, to be licked by it. I should have talked to him, gotten to know him, gotten to know that tongue, but he was much to reserved and protective of his tongue and I was altogether too shy. His speech was sloppy and labored as you would imagine. Trying to speak with a massive, throbbing tongue flopping around, unable to contact the teeth properly to pronounce words, he rarely tried. I'd watch the saliva dripping down his chin onto the desk. The look in his eyes made it quite clear that speaking was a waking nightmare for him. I wonder if he knew that I could understand him perfectly though? That I loved him and his tongue?

As the years went by, his tongue only grew more, as did his anxiety and temper. The kids were merciless, treating him like an abomination. They'd slap and pull his tongue as they walked by as his distended tongue now hung down to his chest. I'd watch him lash out and scream and cry. His tongue would become engorged with his rage and sadness. Oh, how I wish I had the nerve to approach him and stroke his tongue, to wet it and soothe it. I loved your tongue and I loved you as well.

The daily bullying broke him eventually. After being pulled to the ground by his tongue and kicked and spit on and force to lick them, their nasty parts, he didn't respond with his typical muffled scream or wild fist throws, no. He marched, possessed it seemed, into the nearest art classroom and laid his massive, gorgeous tongue on the paper cutting table. He raised the blade, and with one clean slice, it was off. His tongue writhed on the table like a stunned eel, and blood poured from his mouth like overturned bucket. I watched in horror and sadness. It pained me to see such glorious piece of him severed and struggling, but when I looked to him, I saw a smile on his face. He must have been happy to be unburdened now even if that meant death.

I still have the tongue. It sits perfectly preserved in a glass display over my bed. Maybe I let my imagination get carried away, but sometimes I feel it licking me."
copypasta,"Yes Minecraft is symbolic in many ways with The book of Revelation in the Bible and is preparing Us for the End-times war. Whether you want to believe it or not the facts are undeniable and the similarities are tantamount to the fact this game was divinely created through the hand spiritually. The Creator of this game goes by the name of Notch and in Jewish Gematria that equals = 201 and Roman in Jewish Gematria also equals = 201 same goes for with Apollo and what does that mean, you tell me.

The Ender Dragon represent Revelation 12 The Woman and the Dragon.

The Pig Men represents the Demon Legion of Revelation 9

The locusts were not given power to kill them.

You can see this in the game because Pig Men don't attack the player unless the Player Attacks the Pig Men and because they are Legion you attack one you are forced to fight them all.

The Golden Swords the Pig men have represents how the locust has this connection with Gold Crowns.

And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

The Wither represents the beast from the bottomless pit in revelation 9 and the three unclean spirits in revelation 16

They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek it is Apollyon.

And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.

Its not a coincidence that the Wither Has three mouths.

I'm barley even scratching the Surface here with all these profound connections, And the only reason why I'm writing this here is because of Minecraft 10th birthday. Other then that this is just too deep for most people to understand because your eyes are still in the Dream so I'm going to end it here. One day everyone will see"

copypasta,"I'm honestly not really a fan of tiny gingers just because they're such a pain in the ass to peel. I know they are supposed to have a stronger flavor than larger pieces of ginger, but I don't think the work reward ratio is worth it. I tried using some once for a ginger beer I was making, and I spent probably an hour just to get a half pound of peeled stuff and I felt like I wasted a lot. And the end result wasn't any different from just using more of a larger variety of ginger. I guess I could see myself using them in some recipe where the ginger is used unpeeled, but I can't think of any off the top my head. All that being said, I have nothing but respect for people who are fans of tiny gingers, I just don't have the requisite amount of patient to deal with them. It is largely a personal choice I think."

copypasta,"So this didn't happen today, but 3 weeks ago when my dog was taking a shit outside on the lawn. My sister came home with pizza and ate it. She said it was good. Then my parents came home who I haven't seen in over 8 hours and they were like ""Hello son"".

[5 more paragraphs of random bullshit]

I was looking at nature documentaries on my VR goggles when my mom came in and said she needed to use my PC. I of course didn't hear her because I was wearing headphones. So she gets on the PC and starts typing w-w-w-.-p when all of a sudden my dog jumped on the return key and pornhub.com was autocompleted! I jumped out of my seat because I was startled by the porn suddenly on my VR goggles. My mom looked at me oddly and picked up the goggles that I threw off my face. Before I could react, she took one little peek and my mom got scared. She said, ""you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!""

tl;dr tifu by letting my sister order pizza. gold pls."

Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 😂

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone. 😎"

This happened around 5 years ago when I was 15, and I have 0 regrets.

I  was in my Spanish exam, and the girl I liked at the time was wearing  the tightest yoga pants I’ve ever seen, her ass looked huge, and her  thighs were almost ‘spilling’ over the edge of the chair.

I  got an instant erection as soon as I saw her ass, but the thighs on the  chair really got me, and I knew I had to do something as I couldn’t  focus on anything but her thighs. We couldn’t go to the toilet, so I  knew what I had to do.

I put my jumper  on, pulled my dick and balls out of sweatpants, and hid it under my  jumper. As I wrote with my right hand, my left hand was jerking it  slowly. I came quickly, and managed to focus on my Spanish exam again. I  got a B in it in the end!"

copypasta,"This lubricant really comes in handy and is truly as good as it is advertised. I run an illegal underground sweatshop in Brooklyn. Although the lubricant is generally not used in day to day production of our Nike shoes, it is quite important on the police raids that we continually are victims of. Thankfully, we mostly employ young Vietnamese children so they are not too tough to hide, but there still is not enough room to hide them all in our usual hiding spot. This is where this fantastic product comes into play. I dip each one of the Vietnamese children into the barrel drum and then stick them all into the foxhole. The police do not even check the hole because no child could reasonably fit in there, but with the lubricant we are able to fit 15 children in there. Once the police leave we quickly retrieve the children, and although their efficiency is slightly slowed, it is essential for them to be hidden, and it allows our sweatshop to flourish. All in all this is a great product useful for any owner of a children's sweatshop."
copypasta,"A Miami man, Mike Carson, has been officially recognized by Guinness World Records for having the smallest penis. According to Carson and his doctors, his fully-functioning penis is only 1/16th of an inch, the smallest for a fully-grown, adult male.
“For a long time, I was very embarrassed by my penis, but now, I pretty much just go with it,” said Carson. “I’m 29 now, and I’ve had girls who have come up to me, after they found out about it, and said they ‘just had to try it out,’ so I can’t even tell you how many women I’ve been with because of it.”
Carson says that he was picked on in high school locker rooms for years, because most of his classmates thought he might actually be a girl.
“For a long time, it got so bad [the teasing] that I thought I might be a girl, too,” said Carson. “The guys would laugh at me, and tell me it looked like I had a big clit, and they are right, it totally does. But it’s okay, because a lot of those guys died since high school. Heroin is a hell of a drug, and I’m climbing the ranks at a Fortune 500 company, so hey, you win some, you lose some right?”
Carson says he takes his record with pride, and has “no desire” to have surgery to enlarge his penis."

copypasta,"Sonic the hedgehog from the popular sonic the hedgehog series produced by sonic team and sega games Co. was designed in the early 1980s to help Sega games Co compete with the king of the market, Nintendo Co Ltd. because of the poor performance of previous mascots on the Sega master system such as Alex Kidd, Sega games Co. needed an IP that would rival the likes of Nintendo Co. Ltd’s “Super mario” from the Super mario series. The super mario series starred  Super mario as he platformed through an octet of worlds to save his girlfriend princess “peach” toadstool (from the Super mario series) from king “bowser” Koopa (from the Super mario series). The Super mario series skyrocketed for Nintendo Co Ltd, and so Sega games Co wanted to produce a game the was similar to Super Mario but Better in every way: visually, musically, and superior in performance. In 1989 Sega games Co released the Sega Genesis, also know as the Sega master system, produced by Sega Games Co. This 16 bit console came out two years before the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, produced by Nintendo Co Ltd, which allowed Sega games Co to make a bold impression on the new era of video game consoles. And, to headline this “cooler” “edgier” and more “mature” games system, Sonic the Hedgehog ((produced by Sega Games Co) featuring Sonic the Hedgehog from the recently released Sonic the Hedgehog series) was bundled with the Sega genesis/mega drive. Sonic the Hedgehog was meant to be the natural superior and opposite of Super mario, perfectly symbolised by Sonic the hedgehogs blue colouring, which contrasts nicely with the harsh reds of Super Mario. This colour also helped Sonic the Hedgehog (from Sonic the Hedgehog) stand out from the pixel art backgrounds and level elements, allowing Sega Games Co. to get extremely creative with the worlds and levels that they built in Sonic the Hedgehog, which was a huge upgrade from the drab colour scheme used by Super Mario (produced by Nintendo Co Ltd.). To highlight the technical superiority of the Sega genesis/mega drive, the so-called “blast processing”, Sega games gave Sonic the Hedgehog (from the Sonic the Hedgehog series) lightning fast speed, making Super mario (from Super Mario) look old and outdated. The Hedgehog design was chosen for the character of Sonic the Hedgehog (from the Sonic the Hedgehog series) in order to appeal to all ages, as well as to “transcend race and gender and things like that”(Naoto Oshima)[yes that’s an actual quote]. While on the other hand, Sonic the Hedgehogs (from the Sonic the Hedgehog series) “snarky” “cool dude” attitude was implemented to draw in more mature audiences which Nintendo Co Ltd had largely failed to do so far."
copypasta,"A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3 (I couldn't find 2): 
Has some BANGERS tbh but it's nothing special compared to the philosophical level of art that High School Musical 2 is at. Although that one song where they're in the junkyard was tight asf, Troy slides along the walls for some time so that's decent and that fucking Prom song was a jam. Not to mention the bum up in production value that made Troy hip thrusts in that blue suit give a generation of kids fap material in HD for at least 5 years. However, the sexual tension between the gay kid and Chad McChadbrosif is nowhere near as high key as the MASTERPIECE that is HSM 2, the unnecessary description after the colon gave every sane 8-year-old severe anxiety until puberty and, I mean this with the utmost passion when I say, they DID NOT play with enough balls. Sure balls fell from the sky at one point but even my tiny developing brain knew the difference between CGI and real fucking balls. Goddamn."
copypasta,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them."

•	⁠173 is technically impossible to snap necks, because its arms don't move. Rather, SCP-173, as its core nature, snaps necks, in the same way that SCP-682 cannot die. This means that Thanos' durability would be ignored, because SCP-173 snapping necks is like a law of reality.
•	⁠SCP-173 moves instantly. And if anyone has seen the flash, we all know that superspeed is some overpowered bullshit. Nigh-unkillable demigod or no, Thanos still needs to blink.
•	⁠SCP-173, even if it can be affected by the Stones, most likely does not have a soul. This means that Thanos would need to physically destroy it, and SCP-173's durability is a tossup.

Or stick him in the scupper with a hosepipe on him. Or put him in the bed with the captain's daughter. Boom. Now you know.

c) It's rhythmic and relaxing. No stress pooping for that guy. He's just jamming out to the tunes while his poops fall out like a drunken sailor.

So it’s a 2-2 count, and I’m like, ‘Man, I have to pee. I have to go pee.’ So I run in our bathroom real quick, I’m ready to go. I’m trying to pee and I actually s–t my pants. Like right before I’m about to go in the game, I pooped my pants. I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh.’ I know I’m a pitch away from going in the game, so I’m scrambling to clean myself up. I get it cleaned up the best I can, button my pants up, and our bullpen coach, Mike Fetters, says, ‘Hey, you’re in the game.’ So I’m jogging into the game to pitch with poop in my pants essentially. It was the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been on the mound. And I actually had a good inning. I had a clean inning, and I walked in the dugout and I was like, ‘Guys, I just \[expletive\] myself.’ They didn’t believe me, then the bullpen came in and they’re like, ‘Oh my God, you had to see this.’"

copypasta,"Today I am forced to enjoy my birthday alone, with no one because of the monster I have become. The day was May 22nd in the year 2009. It was a a surprisingly warm day, I woke up with my heart pounding full of excitement as I ran up the stairs to be greeted by my mother who had made me some French toast for breakfast and had several toys covered in birthday gift wrapped on the table just waiting to be opened. Life was so joyous. Never a care in the world. If only I had not been so naive, for it was that fateful day that I reached into the fridge and pulled out a few day old egg salad sandwich that would ultimately lead to my demise. Fast forward to about 8pm. My mom had organized for all my school friends to come for dinner at the local Pizza Hut, and a few of my closer friends to have a sleepover. As we arrived at dinner I ordered the breadsticks and some wings. As I wasn’t feeling my best I decided I was better off sticking with something lighter on the menu. I had been laughing with friends and talking about all my new toys when it hit me. I felt a rumble in my stomach. And I figured maybe letting loose this fart will make me feel better. And that, ladies and gentleman. Is the moment my life changed forever. I slightly adjusted my ass on my chair to let some air pass ever so quietly and gently out my cornhole when it slipped. I had let a full blown mud monkey slip out of my asshole and leak down into my light up Spider-Man shoes. And I was immediately busted. The table smelled like shit, I smelled like shit and everyone was absolutely mortified. Even the people at Pizza Hut couldn’t believe what the fuck was taking place infront of their very own eyes as I ran full speed to the bathroom with mud pie running down my shins. I have never forgot. Nor. Have I ever forgave. Today is my birthday but most importantly, May 22nd is the day a boy became a man."

copypasta,"Fuck Pac Man!

1) The graphics are shit. Even outside of a console, you should at least be able to get 2005-era textures out of a browser-based game. This tells me that the designers didn't care about the fans.

2) Pac Man is tired. There hasn't been a good Pac Man game for like thirty years. It's because designers keep making games like this that we almost never get memorable titles like Bayonetta. They're worse than Nintendo with Mario.

3) There's no chicks. Why's Pac Man killing ghosts if he doesn't even get to pork a hot babe at the end? I heard there's a ""Ms Pac Man"" game, but that's probably just designed by Ubisoft to appeal to the DS fashion designer game crowd. (BTW: If you think this statement is sexist, it's not. You should just get thicker skin.)

4) There's no violence. Some professor in Indiana proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that video games can never, ever have an influence on children's minds, so there's no excuse to have a video game without excessive violence. Real gamers only play games that are rated M.

6) You can learn to play it in minutes. You can just turn it off and pick it back up at any time. My mom's played it. That's right: it's a casual game. It's just another stupid browser game like Farmville, made for lousy housewives. When's Google going to get a life and start making games for the hardcore gamers? A guy I talked to said that casual games don't make as much money as hardcore games.

7) There's no multiplayer. Get a clue. Modern games should be played in online multiplayer. If you don't include multiplayer, that's just Google saying that you're leaving the option open to sell us later as DLC. Lamesauce.

8) It doesn't have a good physics engine. If the Unreal and Half Life engines aren't broken, why use other ones?

9) So you're a little yellow guy that hunts ghosts and wanders around mazes getting randomly attacked? Didn't anyone tell these guys that JRPGs are dead?

10) The CEO of Rockstar Games said he doesn't really like Pac Man anymore. Read this out of context quote, ""I don't really"" \[like Pac Man anymore\]."
copypasta,"I see the player you mean.

Steve?

Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.

That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.

I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.

It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.

That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.

Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.

They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.

What did this player dream?

This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.

Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?

It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled].

It cannot read that thought.

No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.

Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?

Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.

But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.

To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.

Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.

It reads our thoughts.

Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.

And yet they play the game.

But it would be so easy to tell them...

Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.

I will not tell the player how to live.

The player is growing restless.

I will tell the player a story.

But not the truth.

No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.

Give it a body, again.

Yes. Player...

Use its name.

Steve. Player of games.

Good.

Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.

Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.

We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.

Once upon a time, there was a player.

The player was you, Steve.

Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.

Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.

Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.

Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.

Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.

Let's go back.

The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.

And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.

And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.

You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.

Let's go further back.

The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...

Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks ""electrons"" and ""protons"".

Sometimes it called them ""planets"" and ""stars"".

Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.

You are the player, reading words...

Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive

You. You. You are alive.

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream

and the universe said I love you

and the universe said you have played the game well

and the universe said everything you need is within you

and the universe said you are stronger than you know

and the universe said you are the daylight

and the universe said you are the night

and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you

and the universe said the light you seek is within you

and the universe said you are not alone

and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing

and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code

and the universe said I love you because you are love.

And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.

You are the player.

Wake up."
copypasta," Last night I was looking for some porn of the not gay variety.

 Obviously gay porn is gay, so instead I went looking for guy on girl porn. 

But I realized that features a guy, with a penis, and is therefore 50% gay.  

So I started looking for some girl on girl action, till I realized that is lesbian, and is therefore 100% gay.   

So clearly, I had to look into alternative options.  

I started to consider hentai: since no one in it is real, it can’t contain guys, so it’s not gay, right? 

Well, hentai is anime, which not only is gay, but also makes me a weeb. 

The worst option so far.  I considered traps. I’ve long heard debate over whether traps are gay, so I decided to do the math.

 The gayness of traps lies in the premise.

Let’s consider the 5 base premises: 1) a guy and a trap, where the guy initially thinks he’s with a girl: effectively guy on girl, 50% gay 2) a guy with a trap, and the guy knew it was a trap: Dude looking for some dick, that’s gay 3) a girl with a trap, where the girl doesn’t know it’s a trap: that’s lesbian, and is gay 4) a girl with a trap, where the girl knows it’s a trap: effectively guy on girl, therefore 50% gay Therefore, on average traps are 75% gay, with a minimum gayness of 50%.

Not an improvement. 

The 5th option, trap on trap, is a singularity of the 4 prior possibilities, and is therefore on average 75% gay again.  

So I got into specifics. What if it was girl on girl, and the premise was at least one of the girls was just bi-curious, and not actually fully lesbian? 

Well, in that case, their curiosity makes them a cat. Cats are furries, and furries are gay.  

So how about a girl soloing? Well that’s a girl touching girl bits. Lesbian and gay.  

My conclusion is that the only way to live a life free of homosexual sin is to liberate oneself of sexual desire at all, and become an asexual.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
copypasta," As someone who would consider Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed (SSASRT) as the best kart racer out there this was a huge let down. The limited roster is not what bothers me, nor is it the fact that cars do not transform (although I do miss this). The issue is the overall speed, lame boosting and sub par handling. This is coming off of someone who enjoys playing SSASRT on hard and expert difficulty and was literally playing this game minutes before booting up TSR.   


First the speed is significantly slower than SSASRT, it felt like playing 50cc in Mario Kart to me, maybe 100cc and it does not get better on the higher difficulties. For a mascot that's M.O. is speed this is a regression. Boosts from drifting and boost pads do not feel substantial in this game. The boosts end prematurely and it seems like the courses are not designed to get that great stacking effect, or back to back boosts like SSASRT. The handling also seems finicky, I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is off. It could be that I just need to readjust, but SSASRT and Mario Kart feel a lot more intuitive and smooth. The cars in this feel heavy in an awkward way.  


My only guess as to why the above listed issues exist in this game is due to the overall rebalancing of the driving experience for the team mechanic. The team mechanic is placed in this game not just to be important, but essential to winning races. When following the slipstream, the yellow line left behind the person who is in first for your team you get an increase in top speed. If you stay in it long enough you will build up a boost that can be activated by leaving the stream. These boosts feel substantial. My top speed feels substantial. Okay, that's where the speed went! Instead of prioritizing excellent drifting, boost pads, and correct driving of the course, this all becomes secondary to following a squiggly yellow line (at least if you are playing with CPU teammates). Yes it makes the team mechanic a real pay off, but the rest of the fundamental kart racing stack is left in a weakened state making for what I would consider a less than stellar experience compared to the previous entry in the series.  


I will be asking for a refund of this game. I'll stick with SSASRT.  


On a positive note, the game runs great for me and can be played at uncapped frame rates unlike the previous game.   


If you aren't a SSASRT diehard and you love sonic, sure give it a try. Or you have a three person squad to really make most of the team mechanic I think it could be an okay ride. I applaud Sumo Digital for trying something new, but I think too much was sacrificed to reinvent something that should have just been iterated upon."

copypasta," Um, hi. I just recently saw your post about wanting a bf? So maybe I'd give it a shot, I mean you're really cute and friendly. I really like anime like you do! So, um.. Can we date? I'm sure we'll be the best otaku couple! We can listen to anime songs and maybe watch some Naruto and Dbz. Do you like those animes? It's okay if not.. Maybe we can watch something much more like hentai or not. I don't want to seem like your horny average guy, so we can watch something innocent. Maybe bleach.. Heh. You're so kawaii, y'know? I just want to kiss your face and call you my kohai. Would you like me to be your senpai boyfriend? I think it'll be really kawaii. I think I love you, kohai. Please make me happy and date a fellow otaku."

As my friend went afk

I knew he would brb

However, I knew he had to eat 

And that, is **sometimes** a feat

While he did this, I went afk myself

Grabbing a snack from the kitchen shelf

I sat down, and starting reading

But, it was TL:DR

Again, I got up

Went to the kitchen and  

**Forgot**

I forgot what i was doing; smh

Hey! My friend was probably back

I forgot because of my snack

So, I went back

To my room

Their, I sat down **again**

I noticed he still was gone

Naturally, I wondered where he went

I guess he was just enjoying rl

I suppose life is worth living

I turned my computer off

And left the house

YOLO"

copypasta,"I'm usually a pretty chill guy. But there is one thing that really grinds my gears: British people pronouncing things differently. By Jove it's absolutely horrendous how they butcher various words from words like tomato (pronounced TO-MAY-TOE thank you very much!!!) or dynasty (DIE-NASTY)! It makes me sick to my stomach listening to their utterly stupid pronunciations. As a proud country-loving American, i find these new ways to say our American words an assault on my ears any d my freedom! On one particular day, I was strolling through Earnest Hemingway's (A true American patriot and writer!) home and found that there was a cat cemetery there. There always was an abundance of cats that lived at the residence and naturally, graves were made for any cats that died there. Anyway, while I was at the cat cemetery, there was a British family touring that area as well. And the first thing I heard from them was “Oh, look at the cemetery!” I stumbled back and fell flat on my bum. They pronounced “cemetery” as “symmetry”! Why I’ve heard many a few butcherings in my day, but this one was quite unfamiliar to me! I was in a daze, stunned by the worst pronunciation I have ever heard. All I could  hear from that diabolical family was “symmetry... symmetry... symmetry...” I had to get away, my sanity was at stake. I darted away, stumbling through the grounds. I then hastily pulled up a recording of a speech from our current great president, Donald J. Trump, to heal my hearing and feel safe from the outside world. I escaped with my life that day, and I thank God for saving me that day. Can I get an AY-MEN and not the stupid British AH-MEN? If you ask me, the British way sounds pretty gay."

copypasta, I don;t know why all the trolls are harassing game of thrones fans. Leave the episode alone. This was the bestest episode forever! Jon Snow was so in love with our Danny and it was like a romeo and juliet scene when he accidentally killed her. Like. He didnt realise she was trying to save the world and got things mixed up which is really deep and genuis because this show is always about the grey area ad ambiguity.  I thought it was cute how Drogon thought that the iron throne killed danny because it is made out of swords. I thought the dragons were a bit smarter but then it subvert my expectation which not enough shows do.  But most of all I love how cute aria looked in her scene and how strong and inspirational sansa is because this show is a big deal across the world and it can edicate that women are cool too and more badass than boys. Which I think is very important in this modern day. So yas one of the great works of our time finally with the most poetic and deep ending. Absolutely beautiful.

copypasta,"Jesus' eyes widened an imperceptible amount as he took in the sight of Noah, naked, before him.

Fumbling for something witty, he said, ""So the ark's not the only bit of wood my father gave you.""

Noah grinned – his grey eyes flashing in lust. ""Your father isn't the only one who gives me wood.""

Jesus laughed. ""I can see that."" He reached for the hem of his tunic and began to tug it roughly over his head, revealing his chiselled torso, a gift from his dad. Noah watched, hungrily, as he slipped out of the rest of his clothes, leaving them in a son-of-godly heap on the floor.

Jesus stopped when he was in his underwear, a little embarrassed. He was the son of the creator of the entire universe, and he couldn't get some decent boxer-briefs.

Noah's eyebrows shot up in acknowledgement of his Spiderman-patterned crotch. ""A Christmas gift…"" he trailed off, hoping that was explanation enough.

""Hey, no, it's okay,"" Noah smiled, his eyes creasing in amusement, ""I can't say mine are any better."" He reached for his own pair – inside out, on the dresser – and flipped them around so that Jesus could more plainly see the leopard print transfer.

""I like them,"" Jesus cocked an eyebrow, considering how fitting it was that Noah should wear animal-printed boxers. ""Do you have two pairs of those as well?""

Noah just smiled, tossing the underwear aside, and began to saunter forward lazily, completely aware of the effect the sight of his own throbbing member was having on Jesus, whose prominent, holy erection was now shamelessly calling to him from within the red and blue briefs.

Backing onto the cheap motel bed (nobody picked l'Hôtel de la Genèse for it's luxury accommodation – there were strip clubs in downtown Nazareth with higher standards), Jesus let Noah remove his underwear with his teeth, letting out a fervent moan at the pressure of Noah's removal against his own quivering shaft.

Jesus' eyes rolled back in his skull as Noah, as a reaction to his previous utterance, began to pursue the motion, small sounds of pleasure emanating from the back of his throat.

""The beard,"" Jesus moaned quietly, ""it tickles…"" He heard a soft laugh in reply, as the older man crept forward, the two moving backwards together on the bed, until Jesus' head was inches from the shabby fabric headboard. Noah began with gentle caresses, pressing his lips to Jesus' washboard abs, slowly working his way down.

Jesus cried out in passion as Noah's lips reached his substantial manhood, and began to fellate; he was a master with his tongue, caressing expertly with a sensitive, yet dangerous, touch. To Jesus' intense shame, it did not last very long at all.

But Noah had other plans. The two began to kiss passionately, locked in a fiery embrace on the dirty sheets; Jesus did things with his tongue that Noah had never felt before – his phallus quivered with the intensity of it all. Jesus pulled back, lust aflame in his eyes. He leaned in to Noah's ear and whispered, in honeyed tones, a final commandment.

""Thou shalt bend over.""

Noah complied, and Jesus – the evidence of his passion completely recovered from his earlier emission – lowered his hips until they hovered, thighs tense with anticipation, behind Noah's smooth, toned backside.

Like a wild, untameable beast tensed to spring, Jesus licked his swollen lips before thrusting forward with savage desire. He smiled at Noah's sharp intake of breath as he adjusted to the sheer size of Jesus' love-sword.

""Yes!"" Noah cried out in passion, ""Jesus Christ!""

""I'm right here, baby,"" Jesus grunted, ""right…here…""

For a while the only sounds that filled the room were the steady, rhythmic creak of bedsprings; the soft male panting and moaning from both men; and the gentle, intimate slap of skin on skin. Jesus' face was contorted with concentration and erotic pleasure, until – finally – he erupted in Noah's anal cavity, letting loose an orgasmic cry. The two lay back on the sheets, breathing heavily, wrapped loosely in each other's arms.

""Father,"" Jesus panted, ""for…forgive him.""

Noah laughed breathlessly, and the two lay there together, on the edge of consciousness, listening to the music of the night, wafting in through the high window. The décor of the room hinted at what may have once been a slight sense of grandeur – the curtain printed with a pattern of wine glasses and fish.

A loud shout from the distant night penetrated the otherwise silent atmosphere.

""I think that's the sound of somebody being mugged,"" Jesus murmured, his brow creasing with tension. ""Well, that means there are miracles to perform – I'd better…"" He trailed off as he looked down and took in the sigh of Noah, who had lapsed into unconsciousness, his lips parted with a slight smile. Disentangling himself from Noah's arms and rising gently from the bed, Jesus pulled the stained sheet up and covered his lover's body, leaning over to plant one last kiss on his forehead.

The son of God straightened up, and reached for his Spiderman boxer-briefs.

As he gazed down at Noah's sleeping form, Jesus smiled triumphantly to himself, and whispered fervently into the night. ""I will come again."""

# Nudes

### Free verse by Nappy

The maillol is not concentrical!  
the maillol is exceptionally outlandish.  
Are you upset by how flaky it is?  
Does it tear you apart to see the maillol so outlandish?  


How happy is the frivolous odalisque!  
Never forget the flippant and idle odalisque.  


Pay attention to the eroticism,  
the eroticism is the most yellow concupiscence of all.  
An eroticism is chromatic. an eroticism is yellow-bellied,  
an eroticism is unhealthy, however.

copypasta,"Last year, after my uncle had an ischemic stroke and took a spill, he told us a kind of similar story. He was like, “So I put on my hat to leave, and suddenly I was on the ground, blood pooling around my head. I had a thought, ‘I haven’t been worn in a while.’ And then I was being taken to the hospital.” Like, he heard the hat’s thoughts or imagined them. We all laughed at him as he started to cry. And then, after we watched him sob for a while, my eyes opened up and I was sitting alone in my room, and I remembered I don’t have an uncle. Or, I mean, I do have uncles, but the guy who told me and my siblings that story wasn’t anybody I’d ever seen before, and also the “siblings” who were with me, listening rapt to his story, they were complete strangers with smeary dream faces. Sometimes you just have to wonder: even though it tastes nice, should you maybe listen to the warnings on the lotion bottle and only use it externally?"

copypasta,"You are all fucking pedos. How could anyone get off to the idea of removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow.

The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke.

I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.

It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest and her neck, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she sighs breathlessly and her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside her again."

Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is an action adventure beat-em-up fighting video game based on the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games. Shaolin Monks was developed by Midway Studios LA (formerly Paradox Development), Midway - San Diego, and Mortal Kombat Team - Chicago, and published by Midway Games for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.[1] It was released September 16, 2005 in the United States and September 30, 2005 in Europe for both platforms.

The game centers on two members of the Shaolin Order, Liu Kang and Kung Lao, as they travel through the realms in an attempt to thwart Shang Tsung's plans to dominate Earthrealm. The player can control these two characters in either single mode or co-op mode as they venture through several environments fighting enemies. Despite being an adventure game the engine incorporates multiple elements from the Mortal Kombat series such as finishing moves and combos that can be upgraded. A versus mode also allows the players to fight against each other.

Midway developed Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks due to their desire to have an adventure game that would appeal to Mortal Kombat gamers. The game has sold over one million copies as of 2008 and it also received positive critical response."

It's problematic to say the least, because we as educators believe that children need good role models, and pirates are terrible role models.

It just wouldn't stop. 10 minutes after the song I was still ejaculating. My carpets are disgustingly crusty and my keyboard is all jammed. In Communist Daughter by Neutral Milk Hotel, there is reference made to semen-stained mountaintops. Some have deduced these lyrics to mean something else, something that is deep in the lore of their bestselling highly revered record ""In The Aeroplane Over the Sea"", but little do they all know and little do you, the reader, know that these semen-stained mountaintops are factual, and the aforementioned semen is only a mere 40 % of the semen i dispensed while listening to Weightlifters. Now, dear reader, you may be thinking to yourself ""well Stoney, did I really need to know all this?"", and the answer to that is yes. Knowledge is the key to all there is to unlock in this world. The knowledge referenced here is ambiguous, so it could be the knowledge that I've bestowed upon you by telling you this, and disclosing to you the fullest extent of my experience, or it could be knowledge of math, or science, or the Holy Bible - who's to know, and who's to say?

""Is there any efficient way to give myself Schizophrenia? I for some reason want it.   I have ADHD, OCD, and depression. But, for some reason, I want Schizophrenia.   I don't want anyone to tell me that I'm weird or crazy for asking this question, I just want a way to get Schizophrenia, quickly, and effectively. Update: I am 100% aware of the consequences of any psychosis.   I sympathize for anyone else who has psychosis, but for reasons deeper many minds can process, I WANT to suffer from such. Update 2: I know people with Schizophrenia.   You're opinion on whether or not I am sick in the head or naive does not interest me. Update 3: I don't want a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I actually WANT Schizophrenia, not the attention.   I want the pain, I want the impaired function, I want to hear voices, I want the hallucinations, I even want the crippling part of it.   I want my brain to process that way.   I'm only 13, but I think VERY deep, intricate thoughts."""

You might be asking ""Well, why don't you just ignore it? It's not harming you, you can find another one. Besides, your already a degenerate, so why don't you accept other degenerate stuff?"" Well first of all, PROFESSIONALS HAVE STANDARDS. Second of all, it isnt okay. It is much easier to leave out some strange tag and just leave it at classic vanilla, that attracts more anyway. ""But lurantis, the other tags could draw in more people!"" Yeah, the tag that has 6 doujins registered under it most of them being the same doujin in different languages equalling like 2 different ones is gonna compare to over 20,000.

Im not sure how to fuck up to the point where you get a hard on from seeing literal shit. Excretement. Waste. Not quite sure how you intend to fuck a child either. Likewise for animals. Diapers??? HOW???

The largest of which i find confusing is BDSM. Sexual pleasure from pain. PAIN, you know, hardwired to stop pleasure? How do you people find that hot? Don't get me started on ""it's sexy because you're trusting your partner not to harm you"" Ya no.

Oh and feel free to kinkshame me. Just have a good reason for it. Same for finding them attractive and hot."
copypasta,"Why I hate gay people and am homophobic

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 1: Amoral and against god

I am christian if you haven’t figured it out by now. In my opinion, being gay and homosexual is against what god taught and what god wants. It is amoral and a sin to be gay, not to mention out of line. God intended for you to be straight and thats how I think everyone should be.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2: Annoying and Vile

The LGBTQ Community is so annoying and utterly disgusting to where it pains me  to think I live on the same planet as these people. They are annoying, they show their annoyingness everywhere and they do noting but harm society.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 3: People think it’s important

In today’s modern society people think being gay is something to be proud of. They think you liking the same sex is something you should express in every way. IT’S NOT. Nobody wants to know this information and the fact that these people think they are so special makes me want to vomit.

So there you go. That’s why I hate gay people. Feel free to ask questions."

Just finished watching Jojo Part 4 after  \~10 hours and now time for a short rant:  Jojo is easily the most misogynistic anime i ever seen, EVERY women that appears in this show is either damseled,killed, sexualized and or fawning over some guy.  


  
i can name any number of scenes in part 4 alone that shows this , but that shoe store scene when Jojo was sleuthing really takes the cake , where Jotaro says and i quote ""the man isnt married or else he would have gone to the store to get his button fixed""  


  
like EXCUSE ME? Even ignoring the misogynistic context, thats a leap in logic, but that was so sexist, i had to rewind it to make sure i wasn't listtening wrong. The show is okay and still a decent shounen inspite of that , but man watching Jojo is so painful with that  


  
Not to mention how an eleven year old was able to figure out his dad was different but not his wife , who just was infatuated by a man she even acknowledged he was different. 

its just so problematic that an writer wrote these lines and thought ""this is fine"" and sent it up"
copypasta,"The Reddit report system is a frequently underused tool. I have conditioned my body and mind so that I can file a report in just a couple seconds. Sometimes on a supervision binge I send out 200-300 reports in one hour. I am a Christian Community Officer, and monitor various subreddits for foul language, intolerance, disrespectful attitudes, and support for the LGBT agenda. So with all due respect--watch your mouth around me, kiddo, or you might end up on my bad side.

Fun fact: sometimes Reddit has trouble keeping up with my insane reporting speed. I was once accidentally suspended for 3 days after the Reddit systems struggled to process all my reports."
copypasta,"One morning I was outside on my porch, I’d just gotten dressed in my bald eagle T-shirt, Levi’s overalls and My MAGA hat (brand new obviously I kept a closet full of them.) Sipping an ice-cold Starbucks Frappuccino and eating some chick-a-filet while listening to Ben Shapiro ruin liberals, like I did every morning, when two people walked up to me with flyers and a clipboard. At first I thought they were Jehova’s Witnesses so I reached for my red white and blue shotgun that I kept under my rocking chair. When they got a little closer, and before I could holler at them to get off my lawn, I saw that they were dressed head to toe in pins, rainbow sashes, and cat ears. I was so shocked I couldn’t even speak until they started.

“Good morning,” said one, “we’re here to talk about our lord and savior Laverne Cox. Do you believe?” “Of course not,” I sputtered “no red blooded American ships any relationship other than Jesus Christ and Ronald McDonald.” I made the motion of the cross, and the motion of the M. I wanted them to go away, but their energy held me in place. They handed me a flyer with a beautiful woman on it. “Have you ever thought about life on the other side?” I was amazed. That woman was so pretty. She was the kind of woman I’d take out to a nice dinner at the Cheesecake Factory and murder in the parking lot after we talked about her genitals. “No.” Was all I could muster. “It’s fun!” They said in unison. “Come with us, you can give it a try!” Since it was Tuesday and I was unemployed because all the Mexicans took my job as a dishwasher after I smoked weed in the restaurant, I had nothing to do that day, so I went along with it.

They took me to their church, a basement below the forever 21 at the local mall, and I felt uncomfortable walking through and getting uncomfortable stares from all the women in there. The basement was full of anime posters, broken pc’s with people hard at work fixing them, and the altar. The altar was made up of thousands of penises, placed carefully to form a table, and tied together with hair ties and clips.

“Put your penis on the altar” they said. “To be one of us, you have to sacrifice your penis to the trans gods” I was afraid then. What would happen to my penis? I shook my head, but they grabbed me and shoved my penis on the altar. It looked hip at me sadly, and said “why are you doing this to me, you know it’s all for naught! You’ll never be a woman because of chromosomes!” And I paused, and one of my recruiters smiled forlornly at it. “I know, little one, but each of you we add to the altar, the stronger we become! Eventually all men and women will be trans and the cis will have no place in the world! That’s why we call them cis anyway, not to declare a difference between trans and not, but so we can eventually oppress them so much that they’ll have to use it every time!” They put on a mask and started stabbing it to death with a She/Her button. “Nooooo....” it trailed off, its little legs twitching their last twitch, it’s eye closing for good. “You’re one of us now. Welcome to the cult. Come, have some koolaid” I smiled, and threw my MAGA hat to the ground, and took off my shirt. They handed me a T with the image of Karl Marx. I put it on, and they handed me the koolaid. It tasted like estrogen. I felt my body grow weak, but still far too strong to compete in women’s sports. My hair grew out and a pile of money appeared, as it does to every newly recruited tran, in a brown paper bag marked “stolen from real women when we took their rights” I sashayed up out of the temple, and bought a choker at the Forever 21. The woman behind the counter winked at me, pulling down her shirt just enough for me to see the tri-color pin on her bra strap. We are everywhere. We are legion. I vowed never to vote republican, or use the men’s toilet again. We are stronger now. Nobody can stop us."

copypasta,"I see Lila Rossi as a challenge, more than anything. Here is a woman who,in every single aspect, is absolutely revolting - yet I can't help but wonder what would be like, to plunge balls-deep into her repeatedly.   


Thats right, balls deep. With no protection.   


I won't lie, I'm extraordinarily-hard while typing this. I want to grab this...thing... and that's what Lila is, lets not delude ourselves, a ""thing""..... by the hips and ram mercilessly in and out of her quivering, lying cunt with the power of a gladitorial chariot, while she makes stupid faces and contorts orgasmically, unable to lie and control her bodly reactions even if she wanted to. I would erupt violently inside that corrupt and corrupting womb as though the entire fate of humanity depended on my seed penetrating the foul walls of one of her ovaries, the eletrical fusion from this coupling creating the Miraculous Wish as our combined, gutural, Chewbacca-like roars shattered glass and walls alike around us, the house toppling down while we lay there in a filthy, disgusting mess.

copypasta,"Looked up how to induce schizophrenia because I thought some of the responses would be funny. Oh boy I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The following is a real yahoo answers question:

""Is there any efficient way to give myself Schizophrenia? I for some reason want it.   I have ADHD, OCD, and depression. But, for some reason, I want Schizophrenia.   I don't want anyone to tell me that I'm weird or crazy for asking this question, I just want a way to get Schizophrenia, quickly, and effectively. Update: I am 100% aware of the consequences of any psychosis.   I sympathize for anyone else who has psychosis, but for reasons deeper many minds can process, I WANT to suffer from such. Update 2: I know people with Schizophrenia.   You're opinion on whether or not I am sick in the head or naive does not interest me. Update 3: I don't want a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I actually WANT Schizophrenia, not the attention.   I want the pain, I want the impaired function, I want to hear voices, I want the hallucinations, I even want the crippling part of it.   I want my brain to process that way.   I'm only 13, but I think VERY deep, intricate thoughts."""

copypasta,"I'd like to contend your statement. the ""heated"" words used are clearly hate speech. They (SJW game devs) would identify that it is free speech. also in the context that the words were not only used to disgrace a race of humans, drive away that specific gaming body from the dev's populace in games, and also they (shitbag players with foot in mouth syndrome) are free not to be asshats. ALSO the dev is free to ban on that offense. Even if you don't (can't) read the guidelines set as a rule for ""anyone"" not to issue others the hate you keep to yourself. (that last one is just self improvement) also the hate speaker are very much free to create a world they can hate in all they want, just keep it to themselves. aside from the fact that it ends up being cesspools for humans to play in their own filth, there would be no take down issue either. But as soon as they try to emit that crap, then others will bottle them back up. hopefully those who feel their investment, in the place they made was not, and is not allowing their asshattery. seems like the game devs care about the game populace. and because other players don't have the option to get them out of their view, then general online player toxicity is the reason a dev makes the call. deal with it being a hate speech issue that you aren't affected by, and obviously ignore for privilege. if i am wrong, i would like to clear myself with yourself , but with decent convo. not just ""you're a #$!@,"" and ""well #@$! you!"" i try for a settled situation. that's all i see here being done by the devs."

copypasta,"She was what cracked my egg. She is the almighty sword girl who I’ve grown to love over the years, and I’ve only grown fonder of her smash character over time. You see, she fits me like a glove: flat chested, dyed hair, relatively light and weak character compared to the rest of the cast… it’s just all too fucking well. I don’t have to feel like shit and feel bad about myself playing her, all these other bodies either remind me of my masculinity (bowser, lucario, pikachu, Ike, snake, Luigi), or they propose unrealistic body expectations (zero suit samus, Isabelle, corrin). She’s the perfect medium, the perfect trans icon. Lucina represents my early HRT days. I am connected to her such as I am connected to my fursona: Ashe. She has been the one to remind me that not all women have breasts, and that some of them are flatter than flat zone. It still doesn’t remove the crushing pain of warning to be true lesbian bait, but, at least I know I’m not alone.
I play her cause she is the closest to my real life figure, my kindred spirit in a sense. All these other fire emblem spirits, characters, and trophies make me feel inadequate, but she doesn’t.
I am a Lucina main and proud, next time you see someone playing her, remember that they’re a dickgirl just trying to make it in a pussygirl/dickboy dominated world, and they are also playing with a single joycon like the depressed dickgirl they are, living off disability too low to even afford a GameCube controller.

None of you could replicate his success, you're too fucking thick, too dull, too uninteresting.

copypasta,"You're an awful user, and I don't care if you have the hots for Eirika according to your username.

Comparing him to villains who appeared in Kingdom Hearts such as Sephiroth is also not acceptable. I really appreciate if you would stop it with the comments now on. Stalking and harassing other users (including myself) is also not right.

I'm not some horrible bad thing that you think I am. I'm as human as everyone else, and God, you use foul, disgusting language towards someone that you don't even know on any kind of personal level, and whenever I try to explain what I'm saying, all you do in return is attack me, and that isn't right. You seem to refuse to read the comments that actually explain my reasons for why such a crossover idea is wrong and impossible, which would be much better than you putting filthy words into my face. When I started commenting here, you all start this pointless wars with me, when all you had to do right from the start was to just either ignore what I say, or be civilized. Ironically, you seem to be an advocate to let people think what they want about anything, yet here you are kicking and screaming about what I think about crossovers. Do you know the meaning of the word 'hypocrite'? Because that's what you happen to be, all over. And then you actually have the nerve to go bad mouthing at me right in the middle of the conversation, so I can no longer stand up for myself, just because you're all having a hissy fit? That's like throwing a punch at someone, and then right before I can try to defend myself and others who agree with me, you run away screaming into the night! It is stupid, childish and incredibly cowardly. It really reflects badly on you, and most FE fans if this is the example you're setting for them.

After all what you've said to myself and others, I banned and blocked you from my profile. Hoping that you will never cause any more problems again.

copypasta,"No, but I have a degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering, so I know a thing or two about this. Cats (much like any organism) are complex chemical reactions which require fuel to sustain themselves. Every bit of mass on a cat (apart from the fur) requires energy and mass to maintain. Saying that your cat which is twice as big as the others eats the same amount is like saying an SUV has the same fuel economy as a compact sedan. The physics just don't work out. Further, the cat breathes out CO2 constantly and poops, so it has to be regaining mass through food. If it is using more energy, it is respirating more and losing more mass through CO2. Since the rate of mass loss is greater, then the same mass intake would lead to a net loss of mass for the fatter cat.

Unless the fat one is some kind of new breed of hyper-efficient cat which extracts every bit of usable energy and mass from its food, it just ain't happening. Eating more food is what makes things fat, regardless of whatever you read on the internet today. It's just physics."

Today I met Simon. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but fucking Simon Cowell himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Simon, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Simon put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barber shop. Chill guy, really nice about it."

But, but not, not only am I, am I, a-am I, am I, am I seeking s-s-s-s-sugar, I, I keep farting, and my girlfriend says I, euhh I smell, but, but she, she smells too!

I-I-I-I asked, I asked the vegans for help, but they just say I'm not doing this right. Maybe... Maybe I'm not... wh-wh-what could it be? Uh, they, they say that you, any fat is bad, but I, I don't have any fat. I DON'T HAVE ANY FAT! I DON'T HAVE ANY FAT! I, you know what? I think it is, I think maybe some, some oil from my grease trap from, from when I wasn't vegan, maybe, maybe the oil dripped into the food when I was cooking it! That must have been it! Maybe I, maybe, maybe, maybe it was when, maybe, maybe it was when I looked at the bottle of olive oil earlier. Maybe, maybe something, maybe I touched it maybe, accidentally, and then when I cooked, the olive oil got in the food! That must have been it! Why?! Why is it always me?! Why?! Why is it always my fault?! Maybe, maybe, maybe I need to soak my almonds for an extra day in the salted water. Maybe I need to replace the water more times. Maybe, maybe, maybe I need to add, uh, fi-five more grams of sea salt to the water! Maybe... Oh... What if I put, what if I put, what if I put three dates in my shake instead of four? What if, what if, maybe, what if I got Sicilian eggplant instead of regular eggplant? Maybe, maybe it has to be Chinese eggplant. Maybe that's why the vegan diet isn't working for me. Uh, what about... Oh. I know what it is. I KNOW WHAT IT IS! I think, I think I used cassia cinnamon instead of ceylon cinnamon in my oatmeal! I-I-I think the, the Sri Lankan cinnamon is, is a no-brainer. The, the Sri Lankan ceylon cinnamon, it's way more nutrient dense than the cassia cinnamon. That must have been it. Guys...

copypasta,"Some people are saying that scrooge mcduck is the richest comic book character, and i agree. But there are some arguments to be made against our featherd friend.

 You see, the fact is that most rich comic characters actually spend their money, or donate it to charity. Scrooge mcduck leeches off of his nephew, who is indebted to him, and cant pay off of his debts because he has 3 younger nephews to feed, while scrooges duck rivals actually spend their money, and are still close behind him. 

In the netherlands we have a Donald duck comic, and scrooge often enlists Donald in adventures without payment. Donald is also shown working multiple jobs to keep a stable income, because most of the money that scrooge gives him goes to paying off his debt. Scrooge also leeches off of his family by always eating with them, and almost never doing anything back. He also almost never pays the gyro gearloose, even though gyro has saved him multiple times."

Now this kid is completely oblivious to his surroundings, and I'm a bit jealous because he must have really good noise canceling headphones. I've yelled ""stfu retard"" a couple times out the window but he keeps screeching  into his video game, he for sure he didn't hear me.

I play CS:GO often, and one day I ended up in the same server as him. He kept bitching about how the ""AUG is for pussies"" and spammed in chat that barack obama did 9/11. We're down to a really shitty half losing 12-3 and he says to us ""You faggots need to kill yourselves""

I decided to play a prank on him. ""Hey you better take that back or else you'll regret it."" I said. ""Stfu you autist"" he fires back.

Game continues on, still saying that we suck and we're failed abortions. I say ""Yo Jason, (his first name) you better shut your mouth before you'll regret it. Don't make me come to house at Thomas street (our street).""


All that shit talking instantly goes away. He remains quiet for the rest of the game. Game ends on 16-5, not suprisingly him on the bottom of thd scoreboard.


I decided to take this to the next level. I called his home phone the same day with a hidden number. Surprisingly he picked up, only to hear me say ""I told you you'll regret it.""

The next day police were at his house. After that incident he never yelled at the game anymore, I don't even hear him."

copypasta,"I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don't have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here, so the doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish."
copypasta,"Hello to all, 

My name is Funni Dankmed, I was a normal everyday memelord happily stealing and reposting memes without any credit to the original creators (literally everyone) until my home country was destroyed. My homeland, Google+, was deleted (F) purely for the reason no one gave a single shit whether it was still there or not and Google wanted to get rid of it, multiple data leaks gave them the excuse they had been waiting for to finally pull the plug and move on to better things, I was forced to leave my family behind, my whole 6 memes I posted to my profile. Persecuted, I fled my country and am now seeking asylum here, in this foreign land; instead of MeWe like many of my fellow brothers I wanted to go on an actually decent social media platform. This new land though, I find very strange. Tagging is frowned upon and there are cooldowns for replying to comments. Cooldowns for comments are literally bullshit, Facebook has double Reddit's population and there have never been cooldowns for replying on Facebook ever, can the devs stop acting like special snowflakes and just do what literally every other mainstream media platform does, not have cooldowns. Devs please get your heads out of your asses, I had to wait for 3 minutes for each reply after commenting on one fucking post, I don't care if the Kama makes a difference it's completely retarded and unnecessary what dipshit thought this was a good idea? While I am not used to the customs here, I'm willing to keep an open mind to the ideas the developers have put forward and wish to be a part of this community. If I mess up or make a mistake then please take pity on me, for I have nowhere else to go and am trying to start a new life. Please feel free to educate me on this country's customs and popular may may pages where I can steal everything appreciate original content creators.
I look forward to a prosperous future with you Reddit.

Thank you"

copypasta,"There’s one 4 word question that you must NEVER ask a man if you want him to be your boyfriend or your husband… Do you know what the question is? As a woman, it’ll probably sound completely innocent to you. But as a guy, I can tell you that when we hear this question it takes all of the wind out of our romantic sails... No matter how we feel about a woman before she asks it. And if you’ve ever had a guy pull away from you when you wanted nothing more in the world than to have him pull you closer... It’s probably because you asked this question without even knowing it. In fact, you probably thought that asking this question was a good thing even though you couldn’t be more wrong. Again, do you know what the question is? Let me give you a hint… The question is – blank you blank me. Can you fill in the blanks? I’ve asked a lot of women if they know what this question is and only 3 women out of every 100 get it right. So, do you know what the question is? If you’re absolutely sure you’re right then we have nothing else to say to each other. But if you don’t know the answer… or if you want to confirm that you do… I want you to stop whatever you’re doing and go watch the special video I’ve put together for you at the link below right now

copypasta,"I have no issue with the females (I played metroid once and that has a female in it), it's just that it's quite obvious to anyone paying attention that this game was designed as a means to 'defeminize' women, it's a direct product of third-wave feminism. It's media like this that programs them at young age to automatically reject gentleman like myself and instead go for a college fuckboy because they have marginally better looks. THEY are the reason females still continue reject me no matter how many kind acts I dispense into them.

Why, I was ordering at the local McDonald's one day when I complimented the cashier for her great beauty and compared her to waifus that most females can only dream of looking like. Instead of acknowledging my kind words or appreciating that I even gave her a chance in the first place, she handed me my chicken tenders and rudely exclaimed, 'That would 5.99' .

copypasta,"There's this chick I follow on Facebook. I accidentally started following her because she has the same name of this girl I met and thought I was sending a friend request to her. She was only 14 when I started following her. As soon as I realized she wasn't the person I was meaning to follow I went to unfollow her. But then I realized this 14 year old girl was hilariously stupid. She didn't know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics, she couldn't figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on, and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.
She got pregnant at 15 because she thought you couldn't get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the 15 year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is 1 now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.
Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these 2 years I've followed this complete moron she has never written ""your"" when she meant ""you're"". So if this person can get it right, then everyone can."

Id love to see the look ok his face when I go in completely raw, no foreplay, just bend him over and ram his boypussy until he fucking bleeds. With a gun to the back of his head I'm sure he'd stay very nice and quiet, despite the pain. As we both approach climax, I'd bend over to his level and whisper in his ear ""It's been an honor serving you, Mr. President"", then launch a barrage of hellfire missiles from 60,000 feet in the air, detonating both of our bodies in a fiery blaze as I release my seed into the president's cherry red asshole.

These tablets are what we base true ascension on, any deviation from these commandments will result in an instant kick from the Church of Garfield.

I - Thou shalt have no other gods before Garfield.
II - Thou shalt not worship any objects other than lasagna.
III - Thou shalt not use Garfield's name in vain.
IV - Worship Garfield on Fridays.
V - Honor all days of the week, except Monday.
VI - Thou shalt not kill, unless it involves lasagna thievery.
VII - Thou shalt commit acts of adultery. 
VIII - Thou shalt not steal another's lasagna.
IX - Thou shalt not lie to any members of the Church of Garfield.
X - Thou shalt not be jealous of another's lasagna recipes."

I think it’s absolutely moronic to cover your body in non-existent characters from some show that gets more attention than it deserves just because it’s form some nation in Asia which is fetishised like nothing else. These characters don’t give advice or reason. They don’t give people faith. They are good for nothing except a short burst of entertainment, which you of course forgot the second you looked at your phone or another anime.

Like this show and its influence on you, this is something you’ll have forgotten when you’ve found a new show where you can jerk of to skin toned balls with two massive eyes because the artist wasn’t given the budget or was just incapable of expressing emotion so he just made the head two massive fucking eyes. The characters could be between 13 and 23 and when asked you’ll say they’re 18+, but the second you can look at those badly designed uncreative characters created from a template with the only recognisable features being the wacky colour of hair or the amount of useless belts you’ll just think to yourself they are a perfect 14 years old.

One day you’ll look yourself in the mirror and realise that each and every human character in anime is one of 20 designs, you’ll realise what you’ve waisted your life on and your back if you had this tattooed. The second after the realisation you’ll just post something on r/blunderyears to get your imaginary, useless internet points that have absolutely no effect on you besides making you more and more insecure about what others think of you.

The moment I told myself I didn’t care what people thought of me I knew, somewhere deep inside I was lying like a coked up Vietnamese whore promising to mary someone. Look at me standing in the mirror applying the perfect hair foam product just so I can say:”fuck I have bad hair” even though I fucking know I’ve got great hair. Look at me standing in the closet looking at the blouses and sweaters contemplating which one I’ll wear as if my fucking future depended on it.

And yet here I lie, in my comfortable bed telling myself I don’t care. What a fucking joke. Whilst the sound of rolling tyres dances upon my eardrums I know that all those cars are driving due to some time limit, or appointment they gotta make on “time”. Time is a curse that rules your life like the bills you carry in your pocket. Time is a curse that ends when the afterlife starts. Nothing is infinite. The day, the night, your youth, my dreams, our hope and the sun just to name a few, but death is the only thing that outlast all of us as it is the only infinite I know."

She told me to get away from her and started asking what the fuck I was doing. And I explain to her what happen and she settle down. But then she said something really uncalled for. ""That was probably the most action you're gonna get for years anyways so you're welcome"". We were in a pretty crowded hallway and people were stopped and quiet from her yelling beforehand so like a few dozen people heard her say that. And a fucking teacher who was standing outside his door was laughing too. Covered his mouth like he was clearing his throat but that fucker was laughing at me along with everyone else in the area. However the joke is on that girl cause I am gay and that's the most physical contact I've ever had with a girl and now i'm traumatized"

copypasta,"Obviously you’re not a true foot connoisseur like myself. Most experts agree that the bottom of the feet are the best, as seen by the angles most foot fetish art is drawn, the arch particularly allows for quite angular movements downwards which you wouldn’t get with the sandal restricting the foot. There’s also the semi unique quality that is brought to light with sandals, that being the tan line, which you just don’t get with other shoes, the lighter skin line compliments the darker skin that surrounds it.

copypasta,"Here me out: while Aladdin’s incoming negative reviews can’t be laid at the feet of Will Smith. I think his casting had most of us surprised and not necessarily excited. And while I’ve heard he isn’t awful in this movie I think the shoes Robin Williams and for that matter James Monroe Iglehart (the guy who fantastically played the Genie on Broadway) left deserved more than “not awful”.  
  
I think when casting the Genie the production should have gotten more creative. Everyone heard the rumors of The Rock circling the project and now we have good ol’ mainstream Will Smith. Robin Williams was certainly far from what was expected for Genie the first time around though. That being said, I think the creative team should have made a bold choice and decided to cast a woman. And what woman would be better than Whoopi?  
  
She has a large personality like Robin and Will, as well as a unique comedic style that won’t rely on impersonating Robin. I think one downside might be she’s a little old but I think the wise cracking-older Genie would have really worked. After all, wasn’t he trapped in that lamp for 1,000 years? Or was it 10,000 years?  
  
Finally, if you aren’t sold yet, Whoopi was a close friend of Robins and performed with him many many times. It would have been a great way to subtlety and respectfully pay homage to the man that made this story iconic.  
  
Casting Whoopi would have been the perfect combination of forward thinking and different as well as classic and comfortable. Everybody loves Whoopi. Whoopi loved Robin. We loved Robin. Robin loved comedy. Whoopi is good at comedy."
copypasta,"Bruh is not a friendly greeting but rather an expression of surprise. It’s an alternate way of saying “Seriously?”—though you should stick to using the more traditional phrasing if you’re over 40. Now that you’re out of college (and have been for quite a few decades), it’s high time you stop using any variation on the word bro, especially with extra inflections that make it sound like you’re saying “bra.” Because that’s what everyone is hearing. They think you’re talking about underwear."

copypasta,"To be fair, you have to have a 
very high IQ to understand Shia LaBeouf's 
drip. His fits are extremely subtle, and 
without a solid grasp of theoretical physics 
Shia's drip will go over a typical viewer's 
head. There's also his nihilistic outlook, 
which is deftly woven into his fits - his 
personal philosophy draws heavily from 
Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. 
Shia's fans understand this stuffs they have 
the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate 
the depths of these fits, to realize that 
they're not just ""trash"" or ""deadass home- 
less""- they say something deep about LIFE. 
As a consequence people who dislike Shia 
and his big drip truly ARE idiots- of course 
they wouldn't appreciate that many of 
Shia's fits have him wearing his trademark 
Crocs, which itself is a cryptic reference to 
Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. 
I'm smirking right now just imagining one 
of those addlepated simpletons scratching 
their heads in confusion as Shia's genius 
unfolds itself on their Instagram feeds. 
What fools... how I pity them. And 
yes by the way, I DO have a Shia LaBeouf 
tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for 
the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to 
demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points 
of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

copypasta,"I knew a guy who was never able to close his mouth all the way because of his massive tongue. Every day I'd see him struggle as an inch or two or raw tongue constantly dangled over his lip. He would often furl it back in to wet it, keep it from drying and cracking, and each time he'd do so, he'd make this awful gagging noise like someone having an old sock shoved down their throat. Sometimes I'd see him give up entirely and just let it all hang out well past his chin.

There was a certain allure to his massive tongue despite the freakish and grotesque nature of it. I wondered what it would be like to have that tongue, to lick the things that he must lick, to have that sort of reach with taste, to be licked by it. I should have talked to him, gotten to know him, gotten to know that tongue, but he was much to reserved and protective of his tongue and I was altogether too shy. His speech was sloppy and labored as you would imagine. Trying to speak with a massive, throbbing tongue flopping around, unable to contact the teeth properly to pronounce words, he rarely tried. I'd watch the saliva dripping down his chin onto the desk. The look in his eyes made it quite clear that speaking was a waking nightmare for him. I wonder if he knew that I could understand him perfectly though? That I loved him and his tongue?

As the years went by, his tongue only grew more, as did his anxiety and temper. The kids were merciless, treating him like an abomination. They'd slap and pull his tongue as they walked by as his distended tongue now hung down to his chest. I'd watch him lash out and scream and cry. His tongue would become engorged with his rage and sadness. Oh, how I wish I had the nerve to approach him and stroke his tongue, to wet it and soothe it. I loved your tongue and I loved you as well.

The daily bullying broke him eventually. After being pulled to the ground by his tongue and kicked and spit on and force to lick them, their nasty parts, he didn't respond with his typical muffled scream or wild fist throws, no. He marched, possessed it seemed, into the nearest art classroom and laid his massive, gorgeous tongue on the paper cutting table. He raised the blade, and with one clean slice, it was off. His tongue writhed on the table like a stunned eel, and blood poured from his mouth like overturned bucket. I watched in horror and sadness. It pained me to see such glorious piece of him severed and struggling, but when I looked to him, I saw a smile on his face. He must have been happy to be unburdened now even if that meant death.

I still have the tongue. It sits perfectly preserved in a glass display over my bed. Maybe I let my imagination get carried away, but sometimes I feel it licking me."
copypasta,"I have to start off by clarifying: I am neither gay, nor into bestiality, but damn, Biggie Cheese (the rapping mouse from the 2006 animated movie Barnyard) is INCREDIBLY attractive and I have masturbated to images of him countless times. I also love to dress up as him, and the walls of my apartment are covered in posters of him. I have an overactive imagination and love to write, and I write erotic Biggie Cheese fan-fictions online. In fact, my love for BC (as I will be calling him from now on) has become a serious problem. I have pushed everyone I love away from me including my now ex-wife who was married to me for 13 years before I discovered BC. I was recently fired from my job at an law firm for coming to work wearing nothing but a several gold chains, a red beanie, and sunglasses. I have been arrested for indecent exposure 46 times because I always wear the aforementioned apparel everywhere, including to the grocery store and my 5 year old daughter's preschool to pick her up. Because of this and my forcing her to watch Barnyard every possible second i can make her has led to my total loss of custody of her and a restraining order on her and my ex-wife. My entire life is in shambles as my parents have legally disowned me and my sister will not talk to me no matter how hard I try. However I am happy as my law degree is coming in handy as I will soon change my name to Biggie Cheese. This is the one ray of light and hope in my depressing life. I have refused therapy multiple times because whenever I try it we eventually start talking about my intense sexual desires regarding BC. I have been told not to come back to 17 different therapists because I always end up describing, in detail exactly how I want BC to stuff my asshole with his big juicy mouse cock. I am always told by all of my therapists not even Freud could fix what I have wrong with my brain. I am considering killing myself after I change my name because, honestly, the world is better off without me."

I'd take him on a nice date to a spot where 'working Americans' hang out so he can get a photo op and a Twitter thread about how much everyone wishes he was back in office. We'd get dinner at a chain estaurant, see a Marvel movie, then take it back to his place. Id love to see the look ok his face when I go in completely raw, no foreplay, just bend him over and ram his boypussy until he fucking bleeds. With a gun to the back of his head I'm sure he'd stay very nice and quiet, despite the pain. As we both approach climax, I'd bend over to his level and whisper in his ear ""It's been an honor serving you, Mr. President"", then launch a barrage of hellfire missiles from 60,000 feet in the air, detonating both of our bodies in a fiery blaze as I release my seed into the president's cherry red asshole.

copypasta,"""anyone who takes advice from outside the echo chamber is an idiot""

I don't expect Tesla to significantly increase in stock price over the next year or so, but the TSLAQ lie is going to prove harder and harder to maintain going forward. If there was any point for Tesla to die it was 2018. Now, it's the only company that has a Level 5 system nearing completion, the only company that can produce no-compromise EVs at a high volume, the only car company with access to a reasonably prominent charger network, and most importantly the only company that takes the electric, self-driving future seriously and is actually prepared for it. Any other automaker not scrambling to catch up to them is going to face serious issues, if not outright bankrupcy.

The Wall Street is not going to realize this for a long time. They are focused too much on expecting a stagnating company's financials from a growing company, and frankly, pissed off at Elon's idea that a company can strive for more than mere profit and margins. Over they years, they built out this echo chamber that amplifies all the negative aspects of Tesla while ignoring anything positive about it. But Tesla is not a financial company, its existence does not rely on a low stock price. However, this casino game the Wall Street is playing on Tesla's death is reliant on Tesla actually dying. And that's just not going to happen.

Betting on Tesla now is comparable to betting on Bitcoin in the early days. Sounds crazy, yeah. Will never work according to the financial experts, yeah. You know what? Let's see what the future brings.

copypasta,"Atatürk was born around 1881 in the city of Salonica (now Thessaloniki, Greece), which at that time was part of the Ottoman Empire. His family was middle-class, and Turkish-speaking. Though he claimed to be descended from Turkish nomads, he had blue eyes and fair hair, therefore some historians believe he was at least partly of Balkan ancestry.  


During World War I (1914-1918), the Ottoman Empire allied itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary. By this time, the aging empire had lost almost all of its territory in Europe and Africa. Moreover, the so-called Young Turk Revolution of 1908 had stripped autocratic powers from the sultan and ushered in an era of parliamentary government. In 1915 Mustafa Kemal distinguished himself throughout the nearly yearlong Gallipoli Peninsula campaign, in which he helped stop a large force of British and French troops from taking Istanbul. He was soon promoted from colonel to brigadier-general.  


Under the punitive peace treaty of Sèvres signed in August 1920, the Allied powers stripped all Arab provinces from the Ottoman Empire, provided for an independent Armenia, put the Greeks in charge of a region surrounding Smyrna (now Izmir) and asserted economic control over what little country remained. However, Mustafa Kemal had already organized an independence - national movement based in Ankara, the goal of which was to end foreign occupation of the Turkish-speaking areas and to stop them from being partitioned.  


In 1921, with Mustafa Kemal at the head of the army, turkish troops forced the French and Italians to withdraw from the south. Then the Turks stopped the Greek advance near Sakarya, and sent them into a full-scale retreat all the way back to Smyrna on the Mediterranean Sea.  


After these victories, Mustafa Kemal was ready to march against Istanbul, which was being occupied by the British and other Allied powers. Therefore, the British agreed to negotiate a new peace treaty and sent invitations to both the sultan’s government in Istanbul and Mustafa Kemal’s government in Ankara. But before the peace conference could begin, the Grand National Assembly in Ankara passed a resolution declaring that the sultan’s rule had already ended. The last Ottoman sultan fled his palace. A new peace treaty, the Treaty of Lausanne, was then signed in July 1923 that recognized an independent Turkish state. That October, the Grand National Assembly proclaimed the Republic of Turkey and elected Mustafa Kemal as its first president.  


As a president, Atatürk launched a programme of revolutionary social and political reform to modernise Turkey (Turkish: Atatürk Devrimleri). These reforms included the emancipation of women, secularization and the introduction of Western legal codes, dress, calendar and alphabet, replacing the Arabic script with a Latin one. Under his leadership, thousands of new schools were built, primary education was made free and compulsory. The principles of Atatürk's reforms, upon which modern Turkey was established, are referred to as Kemalism Atatürkism (Turkish: Kemalizm, Atatürkçülük, Atatürkçü düşünce).  


Abroad Atatürk pursued a policy of neutrality, establishing friendly relations with Turkey's neighbors.  


On November 10, 1938, Atatürk, who never had any children, died in his bedroom at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. He was replaced by İsmet İnönü, prime minister during most of Atatürk’s rule, who continued his policies of secularization and westernization."

copypasta,"Boys preparing for dodgeball like: What's he that wishes so?
My cousin, Westmorland? No, my fair cousin;
If we are mark'd to die, we are enough
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more methinks would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmorland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made, 
And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say ""To-morrow is Saint Crispian.""
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
And say ""These wounds I had on Crispin's day.""
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember, with advantages,
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
Familiar in his mouth as household words—
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—
Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be rememberèd—
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition;
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day."

Es fuerte, heroico, atento, pero no tiene miedo de ponerse violento cuando alguien trata de perturbar la paz en Kongo Bongo. Yo mismo soy negro, y siempre he admirado a Donkey Kong porque es un mejor modelo a seguir para mí que lo que lo ha sido cualquier otro en mi vida. Los niños se burlaban de mí en la escuela cuando comía bananas, o rodaba como Donkey Kong, o lanzaba barriles, o llevaba una corbata roja, pero no importaba porque Donkey Kong era todo lo que tenía en mi vida. Sin él, estaría muerto o sería un drogadicto delincuente como mis hermanos."
copypasta,"If every male on earth got a boner at the same time, the earth's rotation would slow down. Assume there are about 3.8 billion males, with an average dick height of about 80 cm off the ground. The average dick weighs about 100 grams.

That's a combined mass of 380,000,000 kg of cock.

Now we must make an approximation. For simplicity's sake, let us assume the penises are all evenly lined up in a ring around the equator. The equation for moment of inertia of a ring is I = mass*radius^2. The radius of earth is about 6.371 million meters. Therefore the radius of the approximated dick ring is 6,371,000 + 0.80 = 6,371,000.8 meters.

I = 380,000,000*6,371,000.8^2 = 1.5424*10^22

The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04×10^37 kg*m^2. The Earth rotates at a moderate angular velocity of 7.2921159 ×10^−5 radians/second.

​

Using Conservation of Angular Momentum we can find the new rotation of the earth.

L=I*omega= 8.04×10^37 kg*m^2 * 7.2921159 × 10^−5 = 5.86286*10^33.

​

5.86286*10^33 = (8.04×10^37 + 1.5424*10^22) *omega

-&gt; solve for omega = 7.292115899502489e-05

​

This is 4.97511e-15 rad/s slower than earth's original rotation. This translates to 6.752*10^-10 seconds = 0.6752 nanoseconds longer per day.

​

If we all have a boner at the same time, we will collectively be able to last 0.6752 nanoseconds longer in bed. Stay hard fellas."

Even if I was somehow having the best morning of my life in no way is that morning objectivity good in anyway to everyone.  Also, people literally only say that to me whenever I'm feeling down or trying to avoid them. Like hey its morning woop dee fucking do one more day on this miserable planet.Its the worst part of the day to with all the god dam noise and feeling so god dam tired knowing that there's another day of useless work ahead of you.  I swear I never feel more homicidal rage then when someone tells me good morning. No insult can piss me off or get under my skin more than good morning. Its just an objectivity  wrong statement and saying literally anything else to acknowledge someone's presence would be better.  I would much prefer someone just yell fuck you at me.  Yet I just reply morning in a monotone voice to confirm that it is in fact morning. It just pisses me off so much."

copypasta, In high school I was the most popular kid there and i was a huge stoner. Anyways I was in the back of class and I smoked probably class to an ounce and was blowing it out the window until the teacher noticed smoking smelling and he came to me right as I was hitting my joint and i held it in and he kept an eye on me the rest of class. I held my breath for 9 minutes straight and the second he looking away I blew it out the window. The cute girl sitting next to was so impressed she asked to smoke with me so I took her home and we smoked and then had sex. I pounded her for like 3 hours and she came atleast 20 times. Man high school was awesome for me. 😉
copypasta,"There's this chick I follow on Facebook. I accidentally started following her because she has the same name of this girl I met and thought I was sending a friend request to her. She was only 14 when I started following her. As soon as I realized she wasn't the person I was meaning to follow I went to unfollow her. But then I realized this 14 year old girl was hilariously stupid. She didn't know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics, she couldn't figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on, and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.

She got pregnant at 15 because she thought you couldn't get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the 15 year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is 1 now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.

Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these 2 years I've followed this complete moron she has never written ""your"" when she meant ""you're"". So if this person can get it right, then everyone can."
copypasta,"What makes no sense?  I'm not obligated to play you if I find you annoying or dislike you.  If it's just for fun that's on you for being annoying (or on me for being annoyed); if it's a paid match well enjoy your free win.
Let's try this in a different context, many people have altered art cards (offline play) and let's assume for a second altered art cards are legal play as long as they don't somehow have a tell (i.e. other than the art they look exactly like a normal card hence not cheating).  I'm a second generation Gypsy whose parents died in the Holocaust and my opponent plays an entire deck of altered art Nazi paraphernalia celebrating Hitler, are you saying I have to sit there and play him while he cast ""lightbolt"" with the ""SS"" art striking a gypsy caravan or his stormtrooper gobins crush my spores under their boots like the ""gypsies they are!!!""?  Or let just say your opponent busts out an entire deck of of altered art child porn, do I really have to sit there and watch him attack me with spirit tokens showing a five year old naked child being raped?.  I have no right to tell him what he can and cannot play after all one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter (i.e. what I find offensive you may enjoy and vice versa) and the altered card art is legal (for purposes of the discussion) but at the same time I'm not obligated to sit there and be offended by you either, I can simply concede and give you the win.   Maybe if word gets around you are a pedophile Nazi sympathizer nobody will play with you anymore and you will change your card art because of a lack of opponents but maybe not, maybe you and your neighbor kids can play magic all night long while dressed up in a hitler furry suit.
I know people that refuse to play people with white bordered cards.  I know people that refuse to play people with signed cards.  You can refuse to play whatever you want.  I don't play people with full art cards because I think they look ugly as fuck and hence annoy me.  I don't play people that play SJW cards nor foils.  I also don't play people with mismatched art unless it's obviously intentional (i.e. EVERY CARD THEY PLAY IS A DIFFERENT VERSION) though I will concede the I second I see a duplicate in that case.  If enough people are like me you will get the point and change your deck to something community palatable or quit playing or, as is more likely the case, most of you opponents won't care (or maybe even be like you and enjoy them) hence you and I not playing really doesn't matter, we can both be happy playing with (and against) what we want.  You can build your deck however you want but that doesn't mean I have to play you, enjoy your win."

When I arrived home my mother and father were slaughtering our chickens in order to eat them.  They couldn't stand the chickens struggling while they were on the chopping block, so they had tied their feet together with rope, swung the whole chicken over their heads a couple times like a macabre lasso, and slammed them into a nearby tree, in order to dissorientate them long enough to do the deed.  As I came down the driveway and rounded the corner I saw a chicken SLAM full force into the tree.  The THUNK was so sickening I'll never forget it.  And as my Dad grabbed the chicken and lopped its head off with the axe, my mother saw me, smiled, and said ""Oh, hey!  We're giving the chickens airplane rides!"".

They hadnt known what was happening until I explained why I was home early."

So here's the thing: as a dude, I believe that women find me irresistible. So she would definitely like it if *I* cuddled her to sleep. She might be a little alarmed to see me right there next to her, but my naturally charming demeanor would soon give her to understand that I mean no harm, and that she can feel as safe in my arms as she is anywhere else in the world. My strong arms enfolding her in a quiet, unassuming embrace would engender such a strong sense of well-being that she would fight sleep just to experience it longer, but she would inevitably succumb to the pull of somnolence and drift into deep, blissful slumber."

copypasta,"dude i've actually perfected the art of making grilled cheese sandwiches

first you get two slices of bread, two and a half slices of cheese and a some whipped butter and first thing you wanna do is shred your cheese and tbh i have found this to be a very important step in my experiences because physically breaking up the cheese actually allows it to melt better and more uniformly

when layering the cheese start from the outside and work your way in, placing shreds on top of each other so their weight holds it together and this will be important later when you go to flip the sandwich

after placing your cheese, put the top slice of bread on and butter both sides, and preheat your pan for 2 minutes on medium low heat

once it's been two minutes drop the sandwich into the pan and wait 1-1.5 minutes or until the side is dark and crispy but not black and that's imporant because burning will make the cheese taste bitter

once the first side is done flip the sandwich, which you can do by either using a spatula or just swinging the pan up and landing the sandwich in the pan, and this is my preferred method because it's fun as fuck

once that side is done turn off the heat but leave it for maybe 30 more seconds so the cheese will melt a little more

after that you're pretty much done, i will usually cut my sandwich into triangles and plate it with some chips or crackers but that part is entirely up to you"

Well well well, what do you know? This is the third sentence already! You better stop reading this before I suddenly stop.

copypasta,"I've explained this time and time again. The argument of boobs vs ass must be explored more deeply than a simple comparison of preference. It needs to be broken down further. Let me explain.

Boobs and butts are both secondary sexual characteristics. Boobs, insofar as natural growth, are like penises: The size you get is the size you are stuck with, barring medical enhancement. Similarly, a nice ass is primarily the product of the waist-hip ratio, as well as muscle size, the latter of which can be improved to a reasonable extent.

Now the question is this: In terms of bare necessities, being, if you had to choose between a girl with no tits and a perfect ass, or no ass and perfect tits, what would you choose? Think about that for a second. It is an undeniable fact that while there are certain groups within the male population that appreciate and even exclusively seek flat chested women, can the same be said about pancake asses? Does a man ever really PREFER a woman with no ass and the lower body of a rectangle? I would strongly deny any such statement.

However, if we reframe the question as: which body part has the highest marginal gains in sexual appeal, and by that I mean, if you were to be guaranteed an average ass but extraordinary breasts, or an extraordinary ass but average breasts, which has the highest potential for sum total sexual appeal? It gets trickier. Obviously, an average ass is just fine. It gets the job done, it exists, and to an extent it satisfies a baseline need. As an ass reaches towards a platonic ideal, I am of the belief that it caps fairly quickly. There is no nipple, no axial tilt, no significant cleavage variance.

With the breasts, the story changes quite significantly. There are so many more factors at play. Size of the nipple, height of the nipple, ratio of nipple size to areola, perkiness of the breasts, height of the breasts, and so much more. Therefore, I believe that the platonic ideal of the breast is of much greater marginal value as it approaches perfection, compared to the perfect ass.

TL;DR: All things average, breasts have more potential in terms of marginal gains, all else being average. However, when faced with the dilemma of one or the other, the ass is a baseline necessity."

One kid at the party, Elijah, yelled out, ""Smells like somebody crapped their pants!"". That is the end of the memory for me. My parents know who crapped their pants at my birthday, but they refuse to tell me. Of course it could have always been Elijah, who shouted out to cover his tracks. Or perhaps it could always have been Joey. Joey was the son of to a family of apple pressers, they made the best cider in town every fall. With apples being a natural laxative, could little Joey have maybe had a little too much Cider before the party? It could also have been one of my parents and they are too embarrassed to admit it, I don't think that is the case though, I do have a vague memory of them helping someone, maybe me?

I know we're getting a divorce, and I probably won't see the kids for quite a while till all legal proceedings are taken care of, and I've come to terms with that in my own way. However, I can't wait any longer to tell you this and I need to get it through to you somehow. I need you to give me my Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Disk back. It's the thing you saw me wearing on my arm the last night I spent with you. The night you kicked me out. When you saw me naked in bed, sweating bullets, my forearm swollen like a bright bee sting. I didn't want you to see me like that, doing something like that in our own home. I need to come clean with you about this, as I still respect you as my wife, and the mother of our children. Your suspicions of me were right, in part. We hadn't made love to one another in months. We went to the doctor together, suspected erectile dysfunction, but the results were inconclusive. You accused me of cheating, I let you search my phone and I enabled my location for you to see wherever I went, to prove to you that I in fact was a faithful husband to you. I know that this has been incredibly hard for you, and you craved physical connection with me, but I just wasn't able to deliver anymore. So here goes. Beth, last Christmas, I bought the Duel Disk for Tyler, but it never ended up in his possession. When it arrived, I opened the box and was greeted with a wave of arousal as I saw the Disk. I stared at it for days, I even decided to watch the affiliated show (Yu-Gi-Oh!) when you were working late during the week. I felt something in me change Beth. I was hypnotized. When I saw the characters extend their Duel Disks right before battle, my member would grow so hard it almost hurt. A few episodes in, I could no longer resist. I gave in. At first, I would furiously masturbate to all of the scenes showing a Duel Disk. I would pause, and pleasure myself to orgasm through 3 seasons of the show. Every scene with a Duel Disk received my erotic attention. After a few weeks however, I needed more. I was chasing the dragon. Strapping on that Duel Disk for the first time was euphoric. I had never felt such intense excitement and arousal. When I touched my penis with the hand attached to the Disk, I came almost instantly. My mind exploded with intense pleasure, and I knew that was it for me. I would masturbate 5-6 times a day while you were away at work wearing the Duel Disk. I would be so fatigued by the time you got home, I could no longer attain an erection. This is the truth. This has been my reality for the last 8 months. It was never your fault Beth, I hope you understand and know that. I still love you, but I will never be able to give you physical pleasure without wearing my Duel Disk, and I can't out you through that. I'm so very sorry Beth. I know you probably hate me, and think that I'm disgusting, but if you could find it in your heart to give her back to me, I could never thank you enough. I'm sorry if this was unexpected, but I had to get it off my arm. I'm so sorry."

copypasta,"Not everything in life is about what we learned, but instead what we experience. What I experienced was a nice afternoon learning about the planets in our solar system. What was marvelous about that day was about how much information I have impacted in that short period of time that I had in the planetarium. This experience had inspired me to become a very well-known astronomer when I become older. I always assumed that science was boring, but this experience had opened my third-eye like a Hindu on New-Year’s Day. Furthermore, I have enjoyed my experience at the planetarium and would highly recommend this to any young lad who is inspired to become a scientist. Not only was this experience life changing, but this experience had brought me closer to the Lord HIMSELF! I now read the Bible and participate in Bible Study daily. “Man shall not live on bread alone” -Luke 3:17. I chose this biblical quote because this is very philosophical. This quote tells us that carbs are the devil and not to be consumed on  a daily basis. (Or at least not on Sunday’s due to it being the Sabbath Day). If we went on this field trip during a Monday, I would be very sad, because Monday night is the night when Oscar winning TV show; Family Guy, premiers. Then again, if it’s a rerun, then that’s another story. In conclusion, I strive to become a smart deputy manager."
copypasta,"2 years ago I graduated college with a horrible GPA, zero job prospects, and no direction in life. University had been a slow spiral downward: I breezed through high school due to my natural aptitude, but the more my college courses required hard work, the more I struggled. All my friends had great jobs/relationships and were moving to cities to start their adult lives, while I moving back into my mom’s basement.

Besides working some part-time shifts, all I did was smoke, play video games, and watch anime. I hated myself. I was hyper-aware of my flaws but seemingly could never bring myself to actually change my behavior. It’s a really bad place to be in for a long period of time. Your self-hatred grows and reinforces the idea that you’re always going to be this way. I had let down everyone who ever expected anything from me. I stopped talking with my university friends because I was too embarrassed to answer the question “so what have you been up to?”

After about a year of that, I watched an anime called “Your Lie in April”. It centers on a musician who had lost direction in life and who meets a girl that rekindles his passions. It really resonated with me for obvious reasons, especially the quote “sometimes, your time just stops, huh?” During the ending sequence, I started crying and continued to do so long after it ended. I hadn’t cried in probably years, I had just felt empty. This was an ugly, ugly cry. I realized it was more about my frustration with my life than the show and just let it happen. Why couldn’t I change? I screwed up such a great opportunity in my studies. Now I was far behind people my age. 

In that moment, I had the realization that it was highly unlikely anyone was going save me. The only person who could and would save me was me. I got off my bed, sat at my desk, and just started writing out everything that frustrated me. 

I want to say I figured out answers to everything that night, but it actually took a few weeks of constant written self-reflection. I quit smoking and figured out a long-term career goal for myself that I was actually excited to pursue. I think an important part of this was not telling anyone my plans. This wasn’t for validation, it was for me. I wasn’t going to “try” and do anything, I was DOING it and that was that.

Now, I have a 99+ percentile score on the test to enter law school and just passed 3rd-round interviews for a paralegal position at a pretty prestigious law firm. In a few years, I’m going to attend a top 14 law school and graduate summa cum laude. I know I’m going to do it and nothing’s going to stop me.

I think the most important thing is to get a little angry. You can’t change anything you did in the past, but you have unlimited power to decide your future. Your having non-optimal circumstances right now will only make your achievements more impressive. Figure out each step it’ll take to get there and crush each one. Each time you feel yourself slipping, remember that nothing hurts as much as staying in the same place. FUCK that. Be somebody. Make something that matters. Tell the you that just wants to watch YouTube videos all day that it’s time for them to sit down and shut up for a while.

That’s my spiel, hope it helps friend."
copypasta,"yo mama so old, she's past the legal limit to be alive, even though there isn't a legal limit to be alive, or an illegal age to be dead, but i will make a law, there will be a debate, and there will be a illegal limit in which you should be alive. So, therefore, your mum, when the law is discussed and debated, she will be illegal, and will have to go to another state where her age can be legal."
copypasta,"I went to the barber shop today and i got a nice and clean shave, but it was time to pay, i remembered i didn't have my wallet.

The barber came up to me threateningly, and told me to pay or he'll bust my pondilling.

I took my pistol and i pointed it to his ballings. He was visibly scared and he said ""it's cool, bro. This one is on the house"".

I was about to leave, when i little idea burst in my wilson. I said to him ""write me a check for 1m dollarings"". He didn't hesitate and wrote it fast and clear.

I knew i had to cash those rubicons ASAP. So i ran, i ran like forrest gump on forrest gump I, and i broke a window's car and i drove like a madman. I drove like lighting mcqueen on cars III.

Finally i got in the bank, to collect my juice. But as i was approaching to the cashier, a little idea crossed my white matter. I pointed my gun to her plumbus and i told her to empty the vault really fast and put it all in my bag. And so she did, she put every last penny on them bags.

And that's how i got to Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy."
copypasta,"Maybe this isn't a good time to correct your bad English, but I am deeply concered in the degregation of the English language in younger generations. Especially those who on social networks. Your comment should say ""(insert sentence)"". Word order may seem unsignificant to you but it really isn't. If you want some cheap English lessons I'm usually available a few hours a day (mostly 14.00-16.00 PM) so just send me a DM so we can talk ;)"

copypasta,"I wrestled in high school back in the late '80s and early '90s at a high school outside of Philadelphia where sports were big. Not quite Texas football big but not too far behind. Wrestling was one of the most popular sports at my school behind football and PA was one of the top two or three states for wrestling in the country. I don't know if they still let kids do this but we dropped a lot of weight to be the most competitive in our weight class by the time we hit divisional and state tournaments. I went from 180-190's during football season that ended in November to 152 by January for February, and at 190 I had visible abs so it wasn't fat loss. I won't get into too many details but it was basically starvation, running in trash bags and wet suits, and diuretics and laxatives at the last minute. It was not healthy at all. I hope they still don't allow it.

Back to the buffet. At the end of the season the team would get together and hit all you can eat buffets a few times. You have to imagine 3040 fourteen through eighteen year old boys who hadn't eaten enough for four to five months hitting an all you can eat buffet. Boys that age can destroy a buffet under normal circumstances, then imagine a horde of them who hadn't eaten and weighed 75% of what they should. A fair percentage of them might have smoked something that encourages eating as well, and kept doing so behind the restaurant as they got full.

We'd stay for hours until they kicked us out, and we understandably got kicked out every time. We probably ate through an entire months' profits if not more. There were feats of strength that stretched the imagination. One guy ate 300 fried shrimp/ Another ate 7 entire roasted chickens. And they ate sides and other food. I only remember those numbers almost three decades later because they were records. I once ate an entire baked ziti and meatballs or sausages tray (2' x 1') and that wasn't impressive by comparison. Multiply that by 30 or 40 and you can see the hurt in the restaurant. 

The good thing was that as 17 year old fit males we only had to start lifting to put it back on as muscle. 

So yes, my teammates and I repeatedly got kicked out of all you can eat buffets. The only time we didn't was when we went to Lancaster County Amish restaurants. For some reason I remember Yoder's as the Amish restaurant that could handle us, and I may be wrong on the name, but they had no fear of us. They kept bringing it until some of us threw up and I think they kind of enjoyed all of it: they challenge of seeing us do it and the failure.

By the way, I'm not advocating this binging and overeating but back in the day it was fun."
copypasta,I wanted to see what smooth balls was like. Yes it’s super nice. But boy am I bleeding. I also don’t expect someone to be shaved. It’s a nice treat but I honestly don’t mind abit of hair. Unless it looks like a hitler stache or a mountain man beard
copypasta,"Ok, so I was making a jelly sandwich, standard affair, money's tight, peanut butter isn't free, so I'm making the sandwich. On the jar of walmart brand concord grape jelly, there was a little suggestion above the product name. I couldn't believe my eyes. I had to pinch myself, blink a few times, but it was written, clear as day. *GREAT ON PANCAKES* like, what the fuck? Great on pancakes? Great on *PANCAKES*?! I couldnt fucking believe it, someone out there puts grape jelly on their pancakes, GRAPE JELLY on PANCAKES. And more importantly, they work in fucking marketing for the walmart grape jelly company. The worst part is, now I have to try it, like, I could've gone my whole life before today without trying that and been happy, but now theres grape jelly and pancake in my mouth and I am absolutely fucking disgusted."

copypasta," But this still is problematic. For instance, suppose we have 3 flaccid penises of equal length and width. Then each were each stimulated so as to gain maximum arousal. There would still be an issue because hypothetically, one man could be on Viagra which would produce an erection that would maintain its erect stance for longer, one man might be intoxicated in which case he would have the dreaded brewers droop (or whiskey dick) and it might only be a lackluster affair and the third participant would have perhaps what could be called an 'average' erection. Then we would all be back to square one."

📷 

I want Norm to sit on my face and fart down my throat, preferably against my will. In the movie, we've seen that Norm has a lot of strength, so it should be effortless for him to overpower anyone and forcibly sit on their face. Then, he would rip one of his patented Bear Farts™. I'm not talking about regular farts. I'm talking about the kind of fart that has you walking like a penguin to hold it in, the kind of fart that makes you zone out because all attention has to be placed on tightening your ass crack, the kind of fart that makes you wonder if you shat yourself, the kind that makes you say ""ahh"" once it's over. That kind of fart. That is what I want, down my throat, multiple times. If I'm lucky enough, one of his  butt hairs will fall off from the intense air velocity and choke me to (a wonderful) death. Hopefully  subscribers to [/r/normofthenorth](https://www.reddit.com/r/normofthenorth) will be the first ones to experience it. I'm not embarrassed to say I've lost litres of cum to this thought many times.

Anyways, have you guys ever wondered about this kind of stuff?"
copypasta,"Hi, My son was on the Hypixel server about 10 minutes ago and joined a build battle to build a ""hyper train"". Now I admit I have no idea what that is, my son tried to build a normal train. However, what I did see were a few disturbing images of builds that looked like extremely inappropriate content. First of all I apologize I have to even write that in this forum, but I don't know how else to raise my concern. My son is 9 years old. NINE YEARS OLD...I cannot begin to tell you what my thoughts were about the people who built this. But if this is your ""standard"", then please do something so children are not subjected to that. My son was asking me what those images were. I hope, sincerely that you aren't sitting there laughing. I hope that you do not find humor in this like the other people who read my comments as I posted a chat trying to find out who did this. I cannot begin to tell you how much freaking anger is in me right now. This is not what I expected my child, my innocent child to see.  
If Hypixel is a ""R"" rated or NC-17 rated server, is that plainly seen? Do you make a disclaimer that nudity and pornography is readily viewed in your Minecraft world? You need to understand these people who built this stuff did not leave ANYTHING to the imagination. yes, it's blocks, but they had every detail even genital hair. When I made posted a chat about it, it seems the people there were more complimentary about the ""talent"" it took to build this inappropriate build. Don't you guys thing that is just a little perverted??????  


And if this is the standard or acceptable behavior, then I hope that it is plainly noted that Hypixel is an ""adults only"" server. So I can make a parental decision to not allow my son to play on this server, which I have already made. He will never, ever play on Hypixel again, and I do the responsible thing and alert all our friends of the potential display of pornography.

copypasta,"It also made one very tiny but important change, by changing the subtonic to the leading tone. This matters because in the original TNG theme, lifted from Goldsmith's TOS movie scores, the lowered seventh outline mixolydian mode, which is a little bit less major-sounding than major (ionian) or especially major (lydian). Mixolydian gave it a bit more oomph.

Switching back to ionian, in combination with the choice of instrument (flute, wind chimes, violin), pitch range (high), and dynamic level (soft), give a far more sweet and even innocent sound.

Prior to that, we have a combination of live instruments and synthetic instruments, classic for Trek, which seem to play the sweet against the melancholy. The cello's soulful expressiveness speaks to Picard's pain at his schism with Starfleet, the horn of course represents Starfleet itself, and the flute is telling us something positive.

I suspect this was scored by Jeff Russo, who has been scoring Discovery. I like Russo, but so far he doesn't so subtle or misleading with music, which leads me to believe that Picard will not be war-porn like Discovery season 1 or torture porn like O'Brien. I think we can look forward to something with hope and/or innocence and/or wonder."

copypasta,"I'm sorry, WHAT?  This doesn't even make any sense.  It's a terrible choice of a meme template, with some cubing terms thrown in.  

... IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

What's the deal with all of the shit-tier memes flooding this sub?  Like literally, you take a meme template, fill it in with some kind of cubing terminology selected almost at random, and then post it.  Do you ever stop to think ""is this meme funny""?  No, clearly not.  

And what gets me is that as if the time I'm posting this, this thread has 100 fucking upvotes.  Like...WHAT?  Are you people fucking retarded?  Did you actually click on this meme, get a laugh out of it, and then click the upvote button?  Because if you did, I have some bad news for you... you might be retarded!  

More likely, you just clicked it, recognized the meme template, recognized the cubing situation, and then upvoted without a second thought because that's what memes do - they short-circuit the part of your brain that thinks about what you're reading and goes directly to the part where your brain see something familiar and releases dopamine.  

This is why most major subreddits had to ban memes several years back - because they're low-effort content and they tend to choke out real content because the brain-short-circuit effect, combined with the fact that it's so quick to view an image on Reddit, leads to meme posts getting an abnormal amount of upvotes EVEN in subs where a majority of the users don't want to see memes at all.  You can try this yourself - whenever you upvote a meme post, stop and ask yourself, ""is this actually funny?  Did it make me laugh?  Or did I just upvote it reflexively because [I understood that reference] (https://m.imgur.com/r/matt01ss/0DzhW)?"""

copypasta,"Obviously you’re not a true foot connoisseur like myself. Most experts agree that the bottom of the feet are the best, as seen by the angles most foot fetish art is drawn, the arch particularly allows for quite angular movements downwards which you wouldn’t get with the sandal restricting the foot. There’s also the semi unique quality that is brought to light with sandals, that being the tan line, which you just don’t get with other shoes, the lighter skin line compliments the darker skin that surrounds it. Nothing personal kid, but I get deeply offended when one disrespects the art of feet so unabashedly."

copypasta,"God bless you all for taking your time to read this.  I recently found my son playing a video game called ""Persona 3."" I was doing house chores while he was playing it in the living room. It seemed like a child friendly and educational game at first. The characters were at a school and learning math. The next thing I know, they were shooting themselves in the head! The characters had what looked like guns and they'd put them up to their heads and shoot. I got worried, so I did some research on the game. The guns are actually ""evokers"" used to call upon a ""persona."" I'm worried that my son will one day find a gun and try this out, or try to evoke evil spirits in other ways. I learned that there is a sequel called Persona 4 where the teenagers call a ""persona"" by using tarot cards. This goes against the Lord. As I kept doing research, I learned that these games are a part of a bigger series called ""Shin Megami Tensei."" What I learned about this series is horrifying.  There are games called ""Devil Children,"" ""Devil Survivor,"" ""Devil Summoner,"" and ""Digital Devil Saga"" that are part of this series! This got me really worried about what my son was playing. In these games you summon and fight ""demons."" These demons look really similar to what my son was summoning as ""personas.""  What can I do? I'm scared that if I take away the games, he might try preforming these things in real life and rebel. But if I don't take them away, he'll be felling into the hands of the devil! Please pray for my son!"

copypasta,"I watched a Zack Snyder film once, and it changed my life. Suddenly my inner eye was open to symbolism. At first, all I did was watch Snyder's movies. I couldn't get enough of them. I wept for those who didn't see the true depth of Zack's vision.

Every film I watched since then felt so hollow and soulless. Where were the subtle allegories? The intense slow motion action scenes? So I took it upon myself to re edit movies to a form that perhaps Zack Snyder himself would be proud of. I'm certainly not one who is in the same league of talent as this man, but the best I could do was devote my life to his art.

The first movie I edited was Guardians of the Galaxy. First I toned down the colors. I cut out most of the jokes. I put the Turkish Airlines logo on Quill's ship. Edited crosses into scenes to give them extra symbolism. Scenes without slow motion were given slow motion. They looked choppier because they weren't filmed at a high framerate, but that was a necessary sacrifice. Then I added blood. Star Lord wasn't some sissy. He MURDERED people. And people who didn't understand that were living in a fantasy world.

That was the first of countless movies I edited. But even then it was not enough for me. I started wearing sunglasses at all times, even indoors, even at night. Zack understands that this world can deceive us with its apparent brightness, and he declines to let it fool him. I would be the same way. The only time I would take off my sunglasses was when I looked at religious imagery and think about how it relates to Superman's timeless struggle. Then I destroyed an entire city in a fist fight with some guy who hated my dad.

Since then, I've been in a prison, drinking nothing but Granny's Peach Tea. But I know that Zack Snyder is proud of me."
copypasta,"Edit: thanks for the platinum kind stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me platinum. Thank you again kind stranger!"

Anyways I was in the back of class and I smoked probably class to an ounce and was blowing it out the window until the teacher noticed smoking smelling and he came to me right as I was hitting my joint and i held it in and he kept an eye on me the rest of class. I held my breath for 9 minutes straight and the second he looking away I blew it out the window. The cute girl sitting next to was so impressed she asked to smoke with me so I took her home and we smoked and then had sex. I pounded her for like 3 hours and she came atleast 20 times. Man high school was awesome for me. 😉"

copypasta," Yes, it’s normal. Actually, over 50% of men have some kind of penis curvature. It may curve up, down , to the side, in more than one direction. But, most of these are slight curvatures. Here’s a slight upward curve:  

Most small curvatures are congenital. That means they were there at birth. What causes them? Genetics. You have a long family line and as the genes go from generation to generation none of us form perfectly.

For example: Look at the nostrils in your nose. Not exactly the same size are they? Neither are your hands. Or, your feet. Or your eyes. You never noticed that before. Did you? Ha. Most of us never do.

Now, with our penis, we notice everything. Right?

But, if your curve is small like the one above, and, it is not affecting intercourse in any way. Just forget about it. You’re completely normal.

OK. A small curve is normal. But, if you see your penis bending later in life. And, it keeps getting worse, you probably have Peyronies disease.

Don’t get shocked or freaked out here. Peyronies “disease” is not actually a disease. It’s a condition that usually hits about 5% of men later in life. It’s our punishment for some really hot sex we had when we were younger.

Rough sex can cause some small injuries inside our shafts. Tiny little scars heal them up. And, for 95% of men this is the end of it.

For the other 5% of us, those scars will harden in mid life. The erections will not form normally. that hard tissue will not stretch during erection and it will pull the erection in it’s direction. 

Those nasty little scars can be a big problem. Not because they are so hard to correct, but, because we are never taught about this in sex ed or anywhere else. This kind of bend is a real mental trauma for most men.

Fortunately, 99% of these bends can be straightened out nicely. Without surgery. If you’d like to know more about this or, you would like to know how you can correct this safely and easily, without surgery, you can find all the details at The Bent Penis Organization. This organization and their website is dedicated to non-surgical straightening for Peyronies disease and straightening any type of bent penis."
copypasta,"If your perception of an image is feminine, and you are aroused by it, you are straight and your arousal is straight. It doesn't matter if the ""reality"" of it is different from your perception.

For example, there is literally nothing biological about a drawing. Thus, nothing represented can be factually female or male. Yet people all over the place find themselves attracted to cartoon characters that are mostly presented sexless. They don't ask the creators to make sure that the character really does have a vagina, they just perceive the platonic cues and enjoy some hetero attraction. If the creator was suddenly like ""lol just kidding, it's a boy"" that wouldn't retroactively make all of it gay."

copypasta,"Oh my sweet summer child, do not serenade me with your tales of fear. Fear is for the winter, when snows fall, and the layering of clothes restrict the desires of man to but a faint glimmer of carnal instinct to seek out the ass. Fear is for the dark nights, when the common folk are huddled safe in their blankets and bed sheets, unaware of what lurks in the shadows beyond the flames burning bright. Fear is the lingering hunger, driving good men to carry out unspeakable acts in hopes to win the favor of the temptress that is the ass, knowing that each minute you spend apart from her you risk the fleeting shards of your humanity breaking away, lost like the embers of a flame in the midst of night. I ask you once more, what do you know of this fear? Do not confront me with your paltry urges, blinded by your lust for the ass. Stronger wills than yours have crumbled at the sight of an ass right for the eating. Confront your fears child, and only once you control these instincts you will understand what it is that separates humans from the mindless beasts lurking in the shadows and why it is we face this unyielding journey in search for the perfect ass to eat."

copypasta,"“Aladdin,” the 1992 cartoon feature with Robin Williams as a garrulous blue genie, may not be the best movie from Disney’s second golden age of animation, but like the others it has durable charms and memorable songs. “Aladdin,” the new live-action re-whatever with a blue Will Smith popping out of the lamp, may not be the worst product of the current era of legacy intellectual property exploitation (it’s likely that the worst is yet to come), but like most of the others it invites a simple question: Why? 

The answer — spoiler alert: “money” — may not surprise you. I know it’s pointless to complain about Disney’s drive to wring every last dollar from its various brands. You might as well complain about the animal sidekicks (and I will). But the movie itself, while not entirely terrible — a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art — is pointless in a particularly aggressive way.

The studio’s earlier cash-grab strategy was to protect the classic status of its “A” material through managed scarcity and lavish reissuing. Each new micro-generation of viewers could be initiated into fandom with a bit of ceremony: Here was an old thing that was being passed on to you in a shiny new package, a polished heirloom in the form of a special VHS or DVD edition or a limited run in theaters. What had belonged to your parents and grandparents could also be yours, whether it was “Snow White” or “The Little Mermaid.” (Not anymore with “Song of the South,” though.)

There were problems with this approach, including the preservation of tropes and images that came to seem old-fashioned, and not necessarily in a good way. The patriarchal princess stories. The cultural and racial stereotypes. That kind of thing. But Disney, long committed to doing well by meaning well, has synergized evolving social attitudes with advancing digital technology to concoct a series of updates.

None of these have surpassed the original, but that might be too much to ask. I can’t think of one — not “The Jungle Book”; not “Mary Poppins Returns”; not the recent, somber “Dumbo”; certainly not this “Aladdin” — that seems able to stand alone in the popular imagination. They are weird and grotesque hybrids, belonging to no particular era, style or creative sensibility, like dishes at a chain restaurant that fuse disparate food trends to produce flavors alien to every known earthly cuisine.

“Aladdin” is not a cartoon, but it takes place in cartoonlike spaces that trade the grace and flow of animation for the cold literalism of computer-generated imagery. The animal sidekicks — a mischievous monkey, a loyal tiger and a malignant parrot — are neither cute nor especially realistic. The human beings occupying the frame alongside them look, with the partial exception of the genie, like people dressed up as Disney characters. They run and jump and dance and sing and wear excruciatingly bright costumes, almost never memorably.

Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a thief plying his trade in the marketplaces of the vaguely, vividly Middle Eastern fantasyland of Agrabah, where he meets and falls for Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Her father, the kindly old Sultan (Navid Negahban), is being undermined by his diabolical vizier, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are joined by a magic carpet and a blue genie who grants wishes and also develops a crush on Jasmine’s handmaiden, Dalia (Nasim Pedrad).

The casting is admirable. There’s a brisk, enjoyable early chase through the casbah — the kind of springy action that the director, Guy Ritchie, does pretty well — and a couple of Bollywood-inflected numbers that remind you, pleasantly enough, of the proud history of the musical as a film genre. Some of the voices may make you regret the reminder. (Scott’s is by far the strongest; Smith is not a great singer). You’ll hear a few favorites from the old “Aladdin,” with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. [Alan Menken](http://www.alanmenken.com/m/) is still a wonderful composer, by the way.

But somehow the most familiar songs, rather than lending luster to this version of the story (written by Ritchie and John August), only highlight its incoherence. “A Whole New World,” sung as Aladdin and Jasmine take a moonlit carpet ride above Agrabah and other picturesque locales, conveys neither the novelty of flight nor the wonder of discovery. The visuals are tired and perfunctory green-screen placeholders. Similarly, the genie’s showstopper, “Friend Like Me” undermines its own premise. We’ve had an awful lot of shape-shifting, motor-mouthed “friends” like this one.

One of the new songs, belted out with great conviction by Scott, is called “Speechless,” a ham-fisted attempt to paste some power-princess feminism into the film that feels almost as condescending as the women-in-battle sequence in “Avengers: Endgame.”

And as for the film’s supposed lessons — that you should just be yourself and not be seduced by wealth and power — I mean, come on. What makes the Disney classics, old and new, so durable is their ability to fuse commercialism with magic in a way that overwhelms cynicism. When that fails, what we’re left with is thievery.

copypasta,"Hi. Josef Stalin here. Well, this is my last video. It all has to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my retribution against the kulaks, against all of you. For the last ten years of my life, ever since I became general secretary I have been forced to endure an existence of loneliness and unfulfilled desires all because all the other leftists have never been attracted to me. Leftists gave their affection and sex and love to Lenin, to Trotsky, to Makhno, but never to me. But they soon will, when they see what I'm about to do. I am nothing but a grey blur to you, am I? Well I've been part of this party from the beginning. You haven't given me the respect I rightfully deserve. It has been very torturous. And in those years, I have had to rot in loneliness. It’s not fair. You leftists have never been attracted to me. I don’t know why you leftists aren’t attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It is an injustice, a crime, because I don’t know what you don’t see in me. I am the perfect communist, but yet, you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious mensheviks, instead of me the supreme communist. I will punish all of you for it. On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the farmlands of Ukraine and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up kulak I see inside there. All of that grain that I have desired so much, they would have all rejected it from me and looked at me as an inferior leftist if I ever took a five step  advance towards them. I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one, the true alpha Communist. Yes, after I have annihilated every single kulak in Ukraine, I will take my tanks to Hungary and slay every Council Communist I see there. All those Luxemburgists who live such lives of worker control while I have had to rot in loneliness for all of these years, they have all looked down upon me every time I have tried to go out and create a sattelite state. They have all treated me like a tumor, but now, I will be a God compared to you. You are revisionists, you are revisionists and I will slaughter you like revisionists. And I will be a God, exacting my weather powers on all those who deserve it, and you kulaks do deserve it just for the crime of hoarding grain. All you bandits, you anarchists you have never accepted me and now you will pay for it. And to the communists of Hungary, all I have ever wanted was to love you and to be loved by you. I wanted a QT Hungarian girlfriend, I’ve wanted sex, love, a cult of personality, but you think I am unworthy of it. That’s a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can’t have you, communists, I will destroy you. You’ve denied me a happy life and in turn I will deny all of you life. It is only fair. I hate all of you, kulaks are a disgusting wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood in one giant gulag that expands from here to China, and rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated, and I will give that to you. You never showed me any compassion, so I will show you none. You forced me to suffer all my life and now I will make you all suffer. I have waited a long time for this, I will give you exactly what you kulaks and libertarian leftists deserve, all of you all you leftists who rejected me and looked down on me, treated me like scum while you gave yourselves to revisionism. And all of you kulaks for hoarding all of the grain, I will liquidate you, I hate you, I hate all of you. I can’t wait to give you exactly what you deserve, utter annihilation. 

Some of you are alright... don't go to Ukraine tomorrow."

copypasta,"Im just so sick of all of these libtards.  

Everyday I turn on Fox News and the democrats hound our President. Just stop already. We saw the report. There is nothing there! The people elected him fair and square. Unlike Hilary who had to cheat to LOSE 😂

So I would like a word to say to those naysayers who are spreading FAKE NEWS about President Trump.

Obama was the worst president ever and we FELT that same disdain. It was hard to take when he went overseas and apologized for America.

It was hard to hear when he announced that America was no longer a Christian nation. It was very upsetting when he told us that all bathrooms would be genderless! And when he told use to the job situation, that no big jobs would be coming back to America, it took away our American dreams!

But we bore him as much as we could, we waited and prayed for a President who would take a stand for America. We think God answered our prayers and gave us Donald Trump. He’s not a perfect man but he is a true patriot!"

Anyways I was in the back of class and I smoked probably class to an ounce and was blowing it out the window until the teacher noticed smoking smelling and he came to me right as I was hitting my joint and i held it in and he kept an eye on me the rest of class. I held my breath for 9 minutes straight and the second he looking away I blew it out the window. The cute girl sitting next to was so impressed she asked to smoke with me so I took her home and we smoked and then had sex. I pounded her for like 3 hours and she came atleast 20 times. Man high school was awesome for me. 😉
copypasta,"Yep, you heard me, I want to fuck Nick Wilde. 

Whole you degenerates bitch and moan about that fucking dumb ass animal crossing dog, I have this suede, sweet talking fox that invades my dreams. 

I want him, whisper sweet nothings in my ear, telling me his feelings for me. His red, knotted penis penetrating my virgin tight asshole as we did it on my bed. The very thought of that brings me to the brink of orgasm. 

I've been having these fantasies since that movie came out, and all I can say is that my life has been infinitely better since then. I've got a stable job that pays well, an apartment in my dream city, and that's all I need really.

I chock all this up to my utter devotion towards Nick Wilde (Praise his name). I have a room in my apartment specifically for keeping my Nick Wilde memorabilia in. Among that room I have 12 body pillows that I fuck nightly and clean daily, and about 5 Bad dragon dildos. 

Every night I stay up from 11 pm til 2 am practicing my devotion towards that fox, he's more than a man to me. He deserves all the lust I have toward him, he is a god of sex. I fuck each and every body pillow tenderly and soft, not rough, he deserves only the softest of touches.

One day I know he will fuck me for real, I've seen him before, staring at me through my window, giving me a quick thumbs up and a wink before disappearing. I believe that one day we will live together, maybe start a family and retire to a beach town in Maine. But until then, I have the pillows and the countless amounts of hardcore yiff of every variety I could think of to hold me off.

Nick, if you are reading this, please fuck me, and I love you"

copypasta,"Cock and Ball torture, from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at [en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/).  
 Cock and ball torture \[CBT,\] is a sexual activity involving torture of the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball busting, genital clogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, or even kicking.  
The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Image: Electrostimulation applied to a penis. 

Contents;  
 Section 1- in Pornography  
Section 2- Ball Stretcher  
Section 3- Parachute  
Section 4- Humbler  
Section 5- Testicle Cuff  
Section 1- In pornography.   
In addition to its occasional role in  **bdsm** pornography, Tamakeri, literally ball kicking, is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai, who typically uses her martial art skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.   
Section 2- Ball Stretcher.  
A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum, and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most  common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1 to 4 inches and the steel models can weight as much as 5 pounds.  
Section 3- parachute  
A parachute is a small collar usually made from leather that fastens around the scrotum, and in which weights can be hung. Comical in shape with 3 or 4 short chains hanging beneath, to which weight can be applied. Used as a part of cock and ball torture within a **bdsm** relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effect on the man's testicles. Moderate  Weights of 3 to 5 kilograms can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move. When the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.   
Section 4- humblera humbler is a **bdsm** physical restraint device, used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a bdsm scene. The humbler consists of a physical cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the tighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5- testicle cuff: 

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum, between the body and the testicles, such that when closed it does not allow the testicles to pass through it. A common type has 2 connected cuffs. One for the scrotum and one for the base of the penis. They're one of many different gadgets for restraining the male genitalia.  Also, a standard padlock may be locked around the scrotum, and without the key the man will not be able to remove it. Some men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned,"" and some people enjoy the feeling of ""owning"" their partners. Making the man wear testicle cuffs gives a sense that his sexual organs belong to his partner. Equally, there is a certain level of humiliation inherent in the devices, in which some people are sexually aroused. Finally, the cuffs may form part of a sexual fetish, of the wearer, or it's partner.

copypasta,"I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.

Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit ""1"", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.

Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.

DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.

As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.

In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.

It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins."

copypasta,"There have been instances where I've stared at an obese woman's ass. I was jogging at a county park, where they had paved a track. About a half mile into my jog, I come face to face with the largest ass I've ever witnessed. This was Ripleys quality ass. I stopped running, and spent a few moments trying to process just what exactly I was looking at. My entire body could fit comfortably inside just one of her grotesque bags of ass fat. I'm not exaggerating, or embellishing the story, if she were to get hit by an average size sedan, she'd have to pluck the bumper from out of her ass crack. All I could think was how? How does the physically happen? Flesh has limitations. There's only so much muscle, fat, tendons, blood vessels, and bone can do. How the FUCK does it manage to twist itself into such a form?"

What do you gain from this other than knowing the fact that I am now going to unleash a fate worse than the 10 calamities released onto Egypt by Yahweh himself? I hope you know that I have ascended beyond that of even an ethereal being and that my corporeal presence can only be measured by that of a god. When you are on your death bed you will look back and regret absolutely everything you have done to me. The flames in hell burn bright in anticipation for you as beelzebub himself cries out in the infinite anguish you will soon experience while waiting in hope and prayer that even a single second of mercy would be showed to you. However, your fate is sealed with the unimaginable torment that was wrought in play by yourself. And you have nobody on this planet to blame for this except for yourself for ignoring my call."

But in all seriousness I love Wonder Bread. I could eat an entire loaf if I felt like it just to get that plush pillowy softness of it in my mouth. Wonder Bread is my favorite bread out of all other variants of bread and that includes multiple variations of different arguably healthier white breads because nothing about it tastes like real bread. There is zero nutritional value in it its like Hostess one day woke up and said ""What if we were to make a bread that is literally just Palm Oil, Sugar, and Corn Syrup.""

Literally all the worst things you could ever put in Bread all while straight up fucking lying to your consumers that you're selling them bread and its even better considering for YEARS Wonder and Hostess have been bullshitting you the consumer that Wonder Bread is HEALTHY. Have you not seen Wonder Bread commercials from the 1950's where they say Wonder Bread has so much ""vitamin"" within it that it strongly encourages you to consume copious amounts of it which will lead to zero negative repercussions? They said you literally become Jesus just by eating it and what's fucking hysterical is PEOPLE BELIEVED THIS! EVERY FUCKING WORD!"

I miss you, please, please come back, I'm sorry Catherine... Do you remeberer our first date? It was a fall evening, everything was so bright and colorful, we got married a year later, and I remeber it like it was yesterday. 2 years went by, and Ron was with us... I never was so happy in my entire life, to see his sweet, smiling face... Catherine, I still love you and just wanted to say, that I'm sorry. Please comeback."
copypasta,"While I’m flattered by the attention, I just don’t know if the best use of your time and your life is hating a stranger based on egregiously limited information. I mean, when you are on your deathbed do you really want to think, “at least I spent my time hating strangers on social media”?
It is of course your life, but I just have to assume there are better things to do with your time…but again, thank you for all of the attention, it’s very flattering."
copypasta,"Hi, my name is Kyle i’m 16 years old and i am looking for a girlfriend, she has to be shorter than me, i’m 5’2, and she has to be a gamer because i game a lot and dont want her yelling at me to turn off the xbox. But she cant hog the controller either. 
She has to be at least 17 because i will be 17 next week. And she has to be goth. If anyone is interested in being my girlfriend message me and tell me but dont be mad if i tell you no."
copypasta,"Would you guys consider Jacking Off to be a sport? I don't know about you motha fuckas but i consider that shit to be a sport, okay. If people can sit down and label god damn Golf, which is the boringest fucking sport in the world, god spasm sport. If you can label that shit as a sport, if you can label god damn fishing as a sport, I know damn well you can label jacking off as a sport."

copypasta,"I remember. I fought along side History memes. I fought in the trenches. 
It was a rainy night. The trenches were filled with mud. Everyone's gear was soaked. Moral was at an all time low.
That's when they decided to strike. The sound of gunfire, and screams of the enemy. Taunts of Japanese. My ears started to bleed. I could barely hear my sargent over the clamity. ""Return fire"" he said. I raise my gun over the edge of the trench. As soon as my eyes poked over the trench, I saw it. I saw all of it. Lewd historical figures. George Washington in a mini skirt. Hitler and Stalin, and so many other historical characters, brought low. The worst part was all the upvotes they had. They had so many more than what we had. Instead of returning fire with OC, and high quality memes, History memes just spammed ""if lewd girls can get so many upvotes, how many can out bois get?"". It was a failed, uncreative rally. And before long, we had lost. The mods declared peace. And that was that. 
Sometimes, I can still hear their high-pitched voices in my sleep. Their shrieks of pleasure. It all comes back to me. I shudder to think about it."

copypasta,"Why are there such high incidents of substance abuse within, as you already mentioned, the largest workforce on the planet?

Sounds to me like any data-set on substance abuse among the service industry workforce would be so heavily skewed due to the sheer size of the group. And what constitutes substance abuse? Is alcohol a substance that can be abused? Why don't you look up other industries like medicine, construction, finance, law enforcement and see the massive amount of alcoholism? domestic violence? suicide?

EDIT: For reference there were 15 residents, the doctor kind, at this happy hour I run at this hospital. They finished a full keg, roughly 140 beers, in 30 minutes; that's about 9 beers per person. 

Sounds to me like your blaming the stress experienced by the working class on their jobs as opposed to the entire ubercapitalist system that has the cards heavily stacked against ANYONE WHO EARNS MONEY BY WORKING AND NOT OWNING SHIT.

Their jobs don't stress them out, their lives stress them out. The thought that no matter how hard they work, the hard work will never translate into greater success without other forces intervening, although those forces could be something as simple as reading books. Many of my employees self-taught themselves a multitude of different skills that allowed them to advance their personal careers.

People in retail have shitty jobs where they need to answer to people that are likely of equal intelligence with no special skills other than they *work harder and spend more hours at the job*; intelligent people don't stay put in retail management and those that do don't have angry employees. Yea that sucks, but that doesn't make your job stressful unless you let it. If you're working retail, you likely have a ridiculously simple job. If you're focusing on your shitty manager, instead of making sure Bob gets a perfect latte every morning at 7am, you're going to have a shitty day and you're never going to improve your Barista skills to actually make your day easier and easier. 

People think their feelings matter first, not their performance. If I am treating you like a human being and paying you a living wage, I don't want to hear a word about who you are as a person until you are a productive member of my team and not making the job more difficult for anyone with your bullshit. Every business I ran my employees were a ride-or-die squad and you either proved yourself to be part of it, or found the door. Life was easy for everyone because they worked together; and they worked for ME. They knew I would always take care of them, so they NEVER let me down."
copypasta,"I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH THE SATANIST AGENDA. PURE EVIL IS THE SPIRIT THEY OPERATE IN. WHEN MY DAUGHTER FIRST SHOWED THE WORLD HOW BEAUTIFUL HER VOICE WAS ON A VERY POPULAR SHOW CALLED XFACTOR SHE BEGAN TO TRAVEL WITH HER MANAGER AT THE TIME TO DIFFERENT STUDIOS IN THE UNITED STATES. EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BROUGHT TO A MASONIC TEMPLE FOR A RECORDING SESSION. SHE CAME HOME TWO DAYS LATER AND SAID SHE COULD NOT DO IT. SHE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A PRAYER ROOM WHERE THEY BRING IN NEWLY RECORDED MUSIC TO PRAY OVER CASTING DEMONIC SPIRITS IN THE MUSIC SO THAT IT WOULD AFFECT THOSE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO IT. IM GLAD SHE QUIT THE MUSIC BUSINESS. BY THE WAY, THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL MUSICALLY TALENTED SINGER NAMED SIMONE BATTLE WHO WAS A FRIEND OF MY DAUGHTER ON THE SHOW. AFTER THE SHOW HER DREAM CAME TRUE TO BE A PART OF AN UP AND RISING GROUP CALLED GRL. SHORTLY AFTER RECORDING A HIT SINGLE WITH PITBULL, SHE WAS FOUND DEAD BY APPARENT SUICIDE OR SO THEY SAY. THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS VERY EVIL, AND SATANIST BEHIND THE SCENES RULE THE WORLD. THE BATTLE WILL SOON BE OVER WHEN JESUS RETURNS FOR HIS BRIDE. CHRISTIANS KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL."
copypasta,"What’s stopping the creators of Rick and Morty to write up an insanely hyper intelligent version of Rick that is smart and powerful enough to technologically manifest himself into reality? If he is a malevolent being, then this situation could be catastrophic for the fate of the universe. 

With an evil real-life Rick Sanchez existing, the human race is as good as destroyed. However, if an evil real-life Rick exists, then it is all but likely that, in an alternate universe, the writers of Rick and Morty wrote up a good-guy Rick with the ability to exist in real life. An Evil real-life Rick vs. Good-guy real-life Rick war could quite possibly destroy the universe and humanity as we know it. It is also entirely possible that the writers could do this in the upcoming season, which means that the world could be ending this fall, during the release of season 4."
copypasta,"You see me as jerking off my own ego. I see what I'm doing as leaving a message behind for others to read. I don't type any of it for you. I type it so that someone maybe a little bit more rational can see a differing viewpoint. Obviously, you can't. I understand why EGS is not a big deal for you. Your point is valid, in your own opinion. And in my opinion, your opinion is shit, and you purposely attacked and tried to use debate tactics to shame another user, after you couldn't understand the context behind ""Eat shit and die :)"". You felt attacked, so you resorted to shitty tactics to try and come out on top. This isn't politics, this is gaming. Your feelings mean fuck all to us. If you're offended, keep it to yourself and move along. Simple as that. But you opened your mouth, and had to insert your opinion where it wasn't warranted. So I figured I'd go ahead and do the same to you. Insert my opinion randomly into a conversation."

copypasta,"I fucking HATE Hatsune Miku. Her disgusting turquoise hair. Her lifeless eyes. Those retarded twintails. I wanna cut them off. Her voice sounds like a hamster being squeezed to death between an elevator door that's closing against it repeatedly. I'd rather listen to the sound of children being murdered than her voice. I would rather have a bear rip my balls off with its claws, reattach them, then do it over AND FUCKING OVER AGAIN than listen to her voice. Her voice is the most vile, disgusting, and horrifying thing I've ever heard. And I have heard a man get tortured and killed. Please never play Hatsune Miku near me again."
copypasta,"Let’s see first of all we have the director stating specifically that this film is going to be political about immigration and the Mexican border...because Terminator for whatever reason isn’t about our obsession with technology and weapons leading to our downfall and the survivors of this future attempting to stop an inevitable apocalypse at all costs. No, it’s about immigration apparently.

Not to mention this is a direct sequel to Terminator 2. A direct sequel. James Cameron’s erasing 3, Salvation and Genesys to make what was meant to be the true ending. No brainer right? Make it for the fans, the original cast, Arnie, Sarah Conner and John Conner grown up. Instead we have SJW-Feminsist Terminator ripping off the same concept of a Human-Terminator Hybrid from Sam Worthington in Salvation, a Mexican protagonist who for whatever the hell reason is the focus of this film being protected...what’s her relation to John Conner? What even is her purpose? Why is this film, a true sequel to Judgment Day, a third entry in the Original Trilogy (at least that’s Cameron’s intentions) even focusing on her? Why is this not about John Conner’s story and ending that whole thing. A fourth film by a different director with an all new cast with no ties to this story would make more sense.

Then of course for diversity purposes, have a Mexican also play the Villain. This cements the political undertones that this is going to be a film about immigration and the border wall, which has been stated on a number of occasions that this is what the film is going to have as an agenda. Of course it won’t be the story, if it was, my god would that be bad. But it is going to be saying things about it, possible portray white people (except for white women) as overtly “evil.”

Now, the new model Terminator does look fantastic, hands down. No problem with that. Honestly this Terminator would be a perfect villain for a sequel to Judgment Day. Unfortunately this is not what this is due to its direction and the clear agendas being appropriated by everyone making this. And then we have Sarah Conner who for whatever reason cares so much for this random girl, again, where is John Conner? He might be transgender for all we know, heck this new girl might be him because hell, we might’ve gender-swapped the character, it is 2019 after all.

Then of course we have the fact that so far...it seems entirely focused on all the women. I’m sorry but did they forget there were men in this franchise who weren’t simply evil? Arnold only had two seconds in this trailer, who knows what role he’ll play or how long he’ll be in it for. Then we also don’t know where John is in all of this and how long he’s in this for and what role he’ll play. The first thing a trailer that is meant to be the “real sequel” to Judgment Day that is for the fans, for the people who’ve been since the first Terminator should be about the original cast, should be about how this story is continuing on from the second one. This trailer is just as bad as Genesys. This isn’t a sequel, merely another entry, it might as well take place after Genesys since in that timeline, John was turned and is destroyed so it’d make sense that he’s nowhere to be found and Sarah is wandering aimlessly and decides to protect another victim of a Terminator attack.

Gods knows what’s actually going on with this film. But this definitely isn’t for the fans and isn’t what anybody wanted. This couldn’t be further from being a sequel to Judgment Day. James Cameron should’ve just said this is Terminator 6 and be done with it. Another cash grab and another nail in the coffin for a dying franchise that none of us wished would die, if it was handled competently by directors and told with as much aggressiveness and intelligence as the first two films, this franchise wouldn’t even be dying to begin with.

Now that we’re making this political, making this feminist as well as a hit-piece on safe countries, safe borders, turning it into a pro-illegal immigration film, this franchise will never recover."
copypasta,"Well you should probably eat shit and die then? Because your argument is so fucking out of whack, it's daunting to keep up with your train of thought.

Yeah yeah, business, capitalism, Rome wasn't built in a day. We get all of this. Everyone can grasp the basic concept of running a business. 

But Epic Games is not trying to run a business. They are a Chinese company. China, is fucking ruthless in its business practices. Especially in entertainment. 

So what we have here, is a failed company. Speak success of their titles all you want, but none of them have been able to earn the company long term relevance in the industry. They pop in and out, piggybacked entirely by the titles. So queue Fortnite. They finally hit it big. So what do they decide to do?

Exactly what they wanted to do all this time, become a major publisher. They saw how a title like DOTA, GMod, Half Life, etc can propel a company into an entertainment giant. They assumed Fortnite was their ticket. What they didn't understand, was Flavor of the Month Eastern Markets.

In the West, it's common for the consumer to find one core game and stick with that for years. The West had gamer ADHD and constantly cycles out titles. Fortnite is still strong, but it's slipping. They took all their cash, and did what China does best, bribe the ever living fuck out of everyone that would accept the money. Create disgustingly restrictive contracts, and completely risk the titles reputation by doing whay they please. 

Epic would of been a success if they contracted a few indie devs for exclusives, carried AAA titles unexclusively, then launched a major sale to compete with Valve. But instead, they decided to be a dick. And as a result, valve directly attacked these companies on their own platforms, such as Metro.

You ever hear the phrase ""force me to make a choice and you've already made it for me""? That's pretty much what's going on here. They forced the gaming community to make a choice. Some of us, with very loud voices, decide to torch their shitty practices as much as we can. People like you decide to have their voices gagged by copious amounts of hard throbbing cock by the EGS staff and run free PR for them. But hey, you do you, being gay is cool by me, it's your throat my man, destroy it all you want with the throat fucking you allow EGS to preform on you. 

Just remember, we tried to warn you that those cocks you love so much are eventually going to get cum right in your eye. It's going to sting a bit, but I guess that's the price you gotta pay when you whore yourself out for a nickel."

This happened around 5 years ago when I was 15, and I have zero regrets. 

I was in my Spanish exam, and the girl I liked at the time was wearing the tightest yoga pants I’ve ever seen, her ass looked huge, and her thighs were almost spilling of the chair. 

I got an instant erection as soon as I saw her ass, but the thighs over the chair really got me and I knew that I had to do something because I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything but here thighs. We couldn’t go to the toilet, so I knew what I had to do. 

I put my jumper on, pulled my dick and balls out of sweatpants, and hid them under my jumper. As I wrote with my right hand, my left was jerking it slowly. I came quikly, and managed to focus on my Spanish exam again.

""Return fire"" he said. I raise my gun over the edge of the trench. As soon as my eyes poked over the trench, I saw it. I saw all of it. Lewd historical figures. George Washington in a mini skirt. Hitler and Stalin, and so many other historical characters, brought low. The worst part was all the upvotes they had. They had so many more than what we had. Instead of returning fire with OC, and high quality memes, History memes just spammed ""if lewd girls can get so many upvotes, how many can out bois get?"". It was a failed, uncreative rally. And before long, we had lost. The mods declared peace. And that was that. Sometimes, I can still hear their high-pitched voices in my sleep. Their shrieks of pleasure. It all comes back to me. I shudder to think about it."

copypasta," 

Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

copypasta,"I eat oats everyday. I had two bowls today. I poach an egg in a ramekin, about 38 seconds in the microwave. I fill up my ramekin about half way with water then crack an egg in it, I also have a plastic lid in my microwave which keeps steam in. Again 38 seconds in my microwave. Took me a few tries to figure out the correct timing. I put 1/2 cup of oats in a bowl, add salt, pepper, garlic powder, no salt seasoning from Costco, onion powder and chopped onions and water of course. I strain the egg with a spoon and then after my oats are done, about 1.5 minutes. I add a kerrigold cheese wedge, fresh parmesan and top it with the poached egg. I add green onions and a hot sauce drizzle. It's delicious. Sometimes I use sour cream, salsa, green onions and cojita cheese with taco seasoning and red pepper flakes. Savory oats are my favorite. I didn't taste this version but I made it for someone who hates oats. I cooked some bacon, diced it up and added the bacon fat to the oats, carmelized onions and mushrooms, a dash of jalapeno water and diced jalapenos, with a spoonful of garlic alfredo and fried onions on top with the poached egg. apparently it was divine."

copypasta,"You sir, live in a virtual existence. Everything you do, is in virtual text. And for that, I feel sorry for you. You don't rationalize context, because you are given all your information raw. You don't see human emotion, you don't see empathy, sarcasm, snide, in your everyday conversations and dealings with your fellow man. Thats your main issue.

Because of this, you take words at face value. Whats written there, is surely EXACTLY what was meant to be said, right? Because you live in a world where you can go back, edit, remove, and purge anything out of line.

Real world doesn't work like that. It works like this. I apologize for saying you should eat shit and die. My own rudeness overshadowed the sarcasm in my response. See, that is how the real world works. You own up to your mistakes, and apologize. Because empathy and emotions actually fucking mean something.

Now, how can empathy and emotions mean something in an apology, if you can't define it's context? Is it sincere? Is it sarcastic? What is it's tone? What's the true message? Can you properly assess this? Yes. You can. You can easily figure this out, in person, as well as online. But you won't. You'll take it as an insult or mockery, and completely ignore it in it's entirety due to my next statement.

You see me as jerking off my own ego. I see what I'm doing as leaving a message behind for others to read. I don't type any of it for you. I type it so that someone maybe a little bit more rational can see a differing viewpoint. Obviously, you can't. I understand why ESG is not a big deal for you. Your point is valid, in your own opinion. And in my opinion, your opinion is shit, and you purposely attacked and tried to use debate tactics to shame another user, after you couldn't understand the context behind ""Eat shit and die :)"". You felt attacked, so you resorted to shitty tactics to try and come out on top. This isn't politics, this is gaming. Your feelings mean fuck all to us. If you're offended, keep it to yourself and move along. Simple as that. But you opened your mouth, and had to insert your opinion where it wasn't warranted. So I figured I'd go ahead and do the same to you. Insert my opinion randomly into a conversation.

You are getting attacked because you are irrationally defending someone. Doesn't matter who it is. Your entire purpose of your first comment was to start shit with the community."
copypasta," Has anyone else noticed this? It's almost as if a woman doesn't use her eggs, they get scrambled and go up to her brain, making her immature and crazy. You have all these women in their mid to late 30's with no kids, who spent 4 years in college for a useless degree that put them 100k+ in debt, they then moved to a city and realized they weren't going to become some high powered lawyer like Ally Mcbeal or successful journalist like in sex and the city, and end up riding random tinder dicks for a decade before realizing at 35 that they are in a dead end job with zero assets to their name, paying 50% of their salary in rent. It's really sad, watching them slowly descend into madness. It's like they become irrational and hateful, and want to burn the world down because they didn't get their way (which is obviously childish). Of course this isn't all women, but it is most. Some women are serious intellectuals, or actually career driven (as in not lying to themselves about what they want out of life), but probably 95% of women want to find a good man and have children. It's literally in their DNA to do this. Instead, they get a constant barrage of media indoctrination telling them to live like the girls from sex in the city, except they all got happy endings because their made up characters in a fictional universe, and real women rode 100+ dicks before 35 and now cannot find anyone willing to settle down with their crazy asses. They call NYC and LA the place where ovaries go to die. Probably pretty true"

copypasta,"I’m 31 and recently ended a long term relationship. I was broken.
I recently went to this cool restaurant/bar downtown with one of my buddies to have a good time. Anyone of any age can come in.
While we were there, there was a girl who was celebrating her 19th birthday (They sang happy birthday and they were allowed an outside cake with 19 on it).

The birthday girl was pretty so I wanted to go chat her up. Her friends were super cute too. My buddy told me to leave them alone and that they looked like “babies”. He didn’t want to go over at first, but since the breakup, every other woman but my ex has been invisible. So he went to wingman with me.

We walked over and wished her a happy birthday. I thought things were going well and the women were laughing. Then all of a sudden one of the girls snaps at me to “take a fucking hint R Kelly”. I was taken aback and just said “excuse me”. She said to read the room and that they were uncomfortable. Another asked to us to go away. I was going to go but I was really bothered by the r kelly comment.
I said it’s fucked up to call me a predator when we are all adults here. My buddy wanted to leave, but I stood my ground.
The birthday woman said that it didn’t matter, it’s weird for someone my age to hit on them, especially when they make it obvious that they are uncomfortable. Then made another r Kelly comment by asking if she she looked like Aliyah to me. Which upset me again.

I apologized for making them uncomfortable but that didn’t give them the right to call me a predator.

One of the women said jt was a “personal problem”. I said that adults are allowed to hit on the adults. It’s not a crime. One woman just asked why I was still standing there and yelled at me to go away.

I was pissed off and when I left, their entire table was singing “remix to ignition” and laughing their asses off. I was furious and humiliated.

When we sat back down, I was seething. My buddy said that it was my fault for not seeing the signs that they were uncomfortable. To him it was obvious, so he wanted to go. He called me “delusional”. I pointed out that they were laughing and he said it was just uncomfortable laughter.

I told him that I had every right to be mad about being called a predator when they were all 18-19. It’s a horrible accusation.to make. My ex was 6 years older than me. He said that they weren’t calling me a predator, just weird for going for teens. He said it was wrong of them to sing after me and that was bullying. But I should have left long before that. I felt like he should have stuck up for me."
copypasta," Semen is surprisingly clean and feels good on the skin.

I have to admit, when i jerk off and cum all over my hand I sometimes don't wash it because as soon as it dries up, my hand often feels as if it didn't came into contact with anything at all. Instead it leaves that fresh feel on the skin of my hands. Therefore when other people shake hands with me, they wouldn't know that my hand has dried up sperm cells on it.

copypasta,"Well you should probably eat shit and die then? Because your argument is so fucking out of whack, it's daunting to keep up with your train of thought.

Yeah yeah, business, capitalism, Rome wasn't built in a day. We get all of this. Everyone can grasp the basic concept of running a business. 

But Epic Games is not trying to run a business. They are a Chinese company. China, is fucking ruthless in its business practices. Especially in entertainment. 

So what we have here, is a failed company. Speak success of their titles all you want, but none of them have been able to earn the company long term relevance in the industry. They pop in and out, piggybacked entirely by the titles. So queue Fortnite. They finally hit it big. So what do they decide to do?

Exactly what they wanted to do all this time, become a major publisher. They saw how a title like DOTA, GMod, Half Life, etc can propel a company into an entertainment giant. They assumed Fortnite was their ticket. What they didn't understand, was Flavor of the Month Eastern Markets.

In the West, it's common for the consumer to find one core game and stick with that for years. The West had gamer ADHD and constantly cycles out titles. Fortnite is still strong, but it's slipping. They took all their cash, and did what China does best, bribe the ever living fuck out of everyone that would accept the money. Create disgustingly restrictive contracts, and completely risk the titles reputation by doing whay they please. 

Epic would of been a success if they contracted a few indie devs for exclusives, carried AAA titles unexclusively, then launched a major sale to compete with Valve. But instead, they decided to be a dick. And as a result, valve directly attacked these companies on their own platforms, such as Metro.

You ever hear the phrase ""force me to make a choice and you've already made it for me""? That's pretty much what's going on here. They forced the gaming community to make a choice. Some of us, with very loud voices, decide to torch their shitty practices as much as we can. People like you decide to have their voices gagged by copious amounts of hard throbbing cock by the EGS staff and run free PR for them. But hey, you do you, being gay is cool by me, it's your throat my man, destroy it all you want with the throat fucking you allow EGS to preform on you. 

Just remember, we tried to warn you that those cocks you love so much are eventually going to get cum right in your eye. It's going to sting a bit, but I guess that's the price you gotta pay when you whore yourself out for a nickel."

You know, I have seen the most bizarre things from some guy in class jerking it to Ronald Reagan tentacle hentai, to people linking Chernobyl to penis-shaped aliens, but your comment is by far the most fucking idiotic thing I have ever had the kind of horrible fucking luck one requires to hear your stupid fucking post. From this point on, when I think of you, I will imagine a diseased turtle taking an enormous dump, with so much unbelievably large amounts of shit that all the protons inside of the methyl sulfide this horrendous crap contains spontaneously fuse into uranium-235 that I can use to shove a nuke up your sub-mental ass. You can write that off as an exaggeration but it is 100% true from the bottom of my already-empty heart. I legitimately think that you lack intelligence. I would say you're mentally unstable but then I couldn't blame the terribly ignorant fucking post on you. I literally cannot comprehend how amazingly dimwitted your dumb ass is. I have trouble understanding the laws of physics, space, and time as if all laws of reality have been devastated and disintegrated due to how dense you are. I could write a damn book on your lack of intelligence that is so long, one could read the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, watch the entire Godfather trilogy, and invent fucking time travel itself before it could even be published under a first edition. Half-Life 3 would be released centuries before I could finish the first chapter describing your purely pointless state of mind. I honestly cannot tell if you were abused too much or not abused enough, because you clearly did not go to school enough to get a proper fucking education. To quote George Washington, ""Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company."" In that case, I'm getting as far away from you as possible. Hell, I'm actually unironically considering moving to Macquarie Island just to be isolated from your brain cell-killing words for the rest of my now-miserable life. I would rather go insane from thinking about you to the point where I pull a Cast Away and consider sexual relations with a volleyball than actually spending time anywhere near you. There is honestly no other way of putting it; you're an irritating asshole who contributes absolutely nothing to this already dreadful planet. And that's saying a lot considering the fact that I've heard of carbon dioxide levels reaching 400 parts per million, Donald Trump becoming president, and toxic fucking comment sections that contain your stupid bullshit. And again I go, being confused by whatever quantum physics you are using to defy the laws of physics with your stupidity, to the point where I'm saying you are worse than yourself. I have nothing else that is most definitely as horrible as you to compare to except you yourself. How does that make you feel? Like a turtle taking a nuclear shit? I really don't have a single shit to give anyway, because you are living proof that there is no hope for humanity left. Really went downhill after that whole thing where Rome fell; that made a lot of people pissed off. But not as pissed off as I am after reading your stupid shit. No, buddy, if I should even call you that, I am not pissed off at your comment. I am FURIOUS. I am so furious that I will personally take that radioactive turtle shit myself just so I can rid the world of your baffling levels of unadulterated doltishness. You are more dull than oxygenated magnesium or even a samurai sword that hasn't been sharpened for a thousand years. And you better be glad that the sword is dull, because if it wasn't, it would be shoved up your ass just like the nuclear turtle shit. I am so fucking angry that even watching an Adam Sandler movie will make me happier than I am right now. If the Greeks made a god of stupidity, you would be the closest candidate to that fucking role. It's not a good thing when you're so fucking unintelligent that people like Socrates would get on their toga-wearing-ass knees to worship your dumb fucking ass. That's when you need to reconsider obviously pointless life choices. Read a fucking book for crying out loud, man! What the literal fuck is wrong with you? After this fiasco I will need at least 12 hours of building up sanity with my psychiatrist. After this she will need to prescribe Ritalin that I will have to take 5 times an hour just to prevent me from snapping because of your disgusting act of stupidity. Your post gave me type 5 syphilis, which I didn't even fucking know existed until I felt itchy dick. Thanks a fucking lot. That was sarcasm, by the way, if you're too stupid to understand what that is (you probably are). Is it even legal for someone to be enough of a dumbass to make someone experience these sorts of emotions? Witnessing your stupid shit was like crawling through the depths of Tarturus itself and Cleveland. I have no words to describe this unintelligible shit yet I have so many. Once more, a paradox caused by stupid turtle shit. I have the most uncomfortable urge to strangle you Edgar Allan Poe style, you evil-eyed, black cat piece of fuck. Put that on your fucking tombstone. For Pete's sake man, you have drained almost every last sane brain cell I have developed ever since my unplanned birth and made my life more unenjoyable than it has to be you fucking cholesterol-ridden shit. I already consider jumping in front of a steamroller whenever I look at my uglyass reflection in the mirror, and then you come along and do this stupid fucking shit. Making me think of turtle shit infused with uranium-235. I'll punch you so fucking fast the force of your damn teeth breaking will cause nuclear fusion to happen from all the damn kinetic energy and make you implode into your possibly nonexistent dick. You want to defy logic, I will too motherfucker. You're possibly the most ignorant piece of fuck I have had the unfortunate chance to stumble upon in the butthole of the internet. I hope that shittyass post was worth it because I am going to kick your shitposting ass if I ever cross paths with you. Eat nuclear turtle shit."

Never won any titles, can walk around without anyone giving a fuck who you are or what you do. my point is, you and I as UFC athletes are not even close to being on the same level. I'm guessing that's why you are constantly attacking me, it's understandable. You're literally and figuratively like a boy compared to someone like me. I'm actually questioning myself as I'm writing this thinking ""why am I even giving you the time of day"" every time I turn around you are writing me some bullshit, why do you try so hard to get my attention?"

First of all, how do you know he's from Florida? Just because he wrote an essay about Florida doesn't mean he is from there.

Secondly, how do you know it's a him? Just because you're on Reddit doesn't mean everybody here is a male. For all we know, it could be a he/she/it.

Thirdly, you didn't capitalise the first letter, you capitalised ""F"" and ""M"" and you didn't use proper puntcuation. Absolutely ridiculous. I offer cheap English lessons via Reddit so please message me directly when you get time.

copypasta,"You sir, live in a virtual existence. Everything you do, is in virtual text. And for that, I feel sorry for you. You don't rationalize context, because you are given all your information raw. You don't see human emotion, you don't see empathy, sarcasm, snide, in your everyday conversations and dealings with your fellow man. Thats your main issue.

Because of this, you take words at face value. Whats written there, is surely EXACTLY what was meant to be said, right? Because you live in a world where you can go back, edit, remove, and purge anything out of line.

Real world doesn't work like that. It works like this. I apologize for saying you should eat shit and die. My own rudeness overshadowed the sarcasm in my response. See, that is how the real world works. You own up to your mistakes, and apologize. Because empathy and emotions actually fucking mean something.

Now, how can empathy and emotions mean something in an apology, if you can't define it's context? Is it sincere? Is it sarcastic? What is it's tone? What's the true message? Can you properly assess this? Yes. You can. You can easily figure this out, in person, as well as online. But you won't. You'll take it as an insult or mockery, and completely ignore it in it's entirety due to my next statement.

You see me as jerking off my own ego. I see what I'm doing as leaving a message behind for others to read. I don't type any of it for you. I type it so that someone maybe a little bit more rational can see a differing viewpoint. Obviously, you can't. I understand why ESG is not a big deal for you. Your point is valid, in your own opinion. And in my opinion, your opinion is shit, and you purposely attacked and tried to use debate tactics to shame another user, after you couldn't understand the context behind ""Eat shit and die :)"". You felt attacked, so you resorted to shitty tactics to try and come out on top. This isn't politics, this is gaming. Your feelings mean fuck all to us. If you're offended, keep it to yourself and move along. Simple as that. But you opened your mouth, and had to insert your opinion where it wasn't warranted. So I figured I'd go ahead and do the same to you. Insert my opinion randomly into a conversation.

You are getting attacked because you are irrationally defending someone. Doesn't matter who it is. Your entire purpose of your first comment was to start shit with the community."
copypasta,"King Tut was the ultimate Shotacon. 

It is widely known that King Tut, otherwise known as Tutankhamun rose to power during the New Empire period of Egypt at a very young age. At the age of 9, King Tut became the God-King of the entirety of the Egyptian kingdom from c.1332-1323 BC... but most importantly, became the most savage Shota to ever exist. Literally named after the fucking Sun itself, this kid lived a lavish lifestyle with millions of slaves of all casts tending to his every command. Imagine being 9 years old and having anything you desire brought to you. He wanted some food? Done. He wanted some random guy dead? Done. He wanted to drown in some Egyptian milf pussy? DONE. 
Sitting in his chamber of gold and gems all day, King Tut would lounge about as his harem of thicc milfs would take turns riding his godly ultra cock. It was said that entering his private rooms was a spectacle of curvy, milf meat covered in sweat and cum.  Of course as King Tut grew into puberty, his otherworldly sex drive only grew stronger. No thicc mommies were safe and at the snap of his finger, could command anyone to be his next Egyptian fleshlight. He was such a chad that he married and fucked his own half-sister, all while maintaining his harem of nannies, maids, merchant women, teachers, business women, whores, Mia Khalifa, Egyptian royalty, and more. It is said that the women who spent countless hours receiving King Tuts seed ascended right into heaven upon their passing, being able to bypass judgment due to their bellies full of Godly cum. Unfortunately, King Tut would leave the Earthly realm at the old age of 19 in order to ascend to the next dimension of big tiddie milfs."

copypasta,"Relatable.
It reminds me of yesterday when I went in the shower to jerk off.
Because it was halloween, my little sister wanted to go out and cosplay as a schoolgirl. When I asked her what was scary in being disguised as a schoolgirl, she simply replied ""I borrowed mom's 12 inch dildo and hid it under my skirt with some flex tape"". It's amazing how 12 years old can be creative.
Anyway, once my mom and sister left for candy hunting, I immediately rushed towards the bathroom to look into the sinkhole, and hit the jackpot. A mass of prepubescent pubic hair could be found. It was easily recognisable from my mom's pusshair because of it's scent and taste: While mom's had a chewy texture and a bitter taste due to all the dicks shoved daily in it, my sister's hair had the sweet aroma of my own semen, while also having a crunchier feeling in my mouth, gently caressing my tongue like an angel's feather.
I have this weird habit of always jerking off in the shower: because of the tremendous amount of sperm that comes from my balls each time I dare push myself to the limits, using toilet paper is a chore. I found that by being in the shower, I could easily clean everything thanks to the power of water.
After undressing myself and putting my clothes in the sink next to me, I crouched in the shower, and moved my lower part towards the suckhole. I gently started pushing forward. Slowly making my way down with my 12 inch sloopity sloop, I suddenly felt a sharp pain: It seemed my sister also threw her razor blade down here; but I didn't care. Her skin oil, covering the surface of these sharp blades, merged into my bleedy penis. Continuing my descent I realised that sis's pubic hair was way deeper than I thought, and I had already reached max depth.
Resigning myself to getting out of here, I realised something: I was stuck.
Pipe-Chan, not letting go of my hose, kept pulling me back each time I tried to leave. Because I didn't want to cut off my only mean to live, I decided to use my secret technique: Blind shot.
I closed my eyes, and tried to visualise the last loli guro vore needle hentai that I read: The moment the first image came to my mind, my balls instantly released their endless reserves of white milk and propelled me into the air.
After that my mom entered the room and looked at my penis and thought it turned emo because of all the scratches. Last thing I know the hairdresser decided to give a wig to my shlonger to fit it's personality.

Even if it seems like you're wasting potential children, you must not forget how much pleasure you get from doing it. I'm not saying you should abuse, but from time to time, it doesn't hurt."

copypasta,"As soon as I consume any of the steaks cooked medium at any longhorn steakhouse establishment, I seem to encounter a common issue. After around 55-65 minutes,  my stomach starts to violently vibrate and eventually I’m forced to use the restroom. A distinct steamy brown soup leaks out of my anal sphincter. I begin to cough up a saliva liquid as it leaks out. Eventually, when I can’t hold anymore, I start to shoot out the soup at an unprecedented speed. I would estimate around 50-60 mph.  The pure speed and heat scalds the inside of my anus and some small cuts usually follow. Some blood, but nothing serious. This constant stream of fluid usually carries on for around 3 straight minutes!!!  Sometimes there’s so much liquid I have to flush mid-fountain to prevent spillage onto the floor! I am posting this to seek help, because I love the steaks at longhorn, but hate this experience, please! Doctors of reddit help!"

copypasta,"Actually Vice City makes more sense because there was a game back in the day called Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. It's a video game for the PS2 home-gaming console. It was pretty popular. It was made by video game developers called Rockstar Games. Fun fact: they also made a fairly popular game late last year called Red Dead Redemption 2, which was the second installment in the Red Dead Redemption series, actually the third installment in the Red Dead series, and actually the prequel to Red Dead Redemption, which is the game that takes place right after Red Dead Redemption 2. So those people also make the Grand Theft Auto series. So it makes sense to say Vice City because it was a reference to the video game made by Rockstar Games."

copypasta,"Well actually the earth is a pyramid. You see the illuminati was created at the same time the universe was. When they created our earth they also created a separate species of highly advanced lizard people that will eventually be known as some of the biggest figures of history. These lizard people actually have had the technology to clone people and shapeshift since they were placed on this planet. Remember Akhenaten? A lizard person who disguised himself to rule the Egyptians and to force them to worship the illuminati, hence the building of the pyramids. Barack Obama? A clone of the Akhenaten lizard shapeshifter. You see this was all discovered recently by an anonymous doctor. His tests proved that the 5 largest poles on this pyramid we call earth, are actually communication devices to the original Illuminati beings. Everything is illuminati, they are everywhere. They are everyone. There is no escape from the illuminati, and the best way is to just live with what we've got. Do not rebel against them, for they will completely and utterly annihilate all life forms if they choose. That is why the earth is a dodecahedron"

When I first met wrestling I never though I would be where I am today and how much I still have to accomplish. When I first started I hated wrestling and wanted to quit, but as the hard work started paying and I started to realize more what wrestling meant to me I fell in love with this sport. My blood, sweat and tears I shed everyday started paying off in life and on the mat. On the mat I got better and better each day but not only on the mat I was nothing I wasn’t so skinny anymore and I actually had definition to me. My ninth grade year of high school I never though I would be in the position of a varsity spot my first year!! After my freshman year went by Ann it didn’t go to well😂. I realized I need to get to work NOW because EVERYDAY MATTERS and I started grinding again. As the next year came around I can’t even explain to you how eager I was to get back into that mat. Even though my sophomore year I fell short of my goal of a state placer I was runner up at sectionals. Than districts came around and I knew i was the best I could beat these seniors and that’s exactly what I did. I beat TWO seniors in close matches that required heart and dedication, I than found myself in the DISTRICT finals against one of the best in the state and lost but it wasn’t anything to sleep on. Than at regionals I went 1-2 but was proud of myself and I realized than I know I can do it. Since than I’ve been going everyday and doing all I can for next year. Since the season ended I got to work and drill with some of the best in the country and world. Next season I’ll be readier than ever and ILL BE COMING FOR THAT STATE TITLE. Thank you wrestling for all the hard work I’ve put in and the accomplishments that came out of that🙏🙏🥰"

copypasta,"I came to this conclusion after watching my village for around 15 minutes to see what they actually did. While this sounds like a joke, I actually looked into this and it turns out that the villagers operate under a semi-communistic socialist economic system, with only a single element that prevents them being fully communist, which is obviously the fact that they still use money to trade with outsiders. Village society operates under ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"", as all villagers (save the disabled (nitwits) or children) will work to the best of their ability and give food and resources to fellow villagers. There is no economic hierarchy in villages, as there is no ""boss"" villager who pays other villagers wages in order to work for him. Instead, villagers work for the community and give their produce to other villagers. In fact, villagers are entirely lacking in any sort of hierarchy, making their society both classless and stateless, the two categories that must be filled in order for any society to be considered fully communist. When threatened, villagers co-operate to build a golem, a selfless automaton that displays altruism towards villagers and will defend them at any cost, rather then establish a military hierarchy, preserving their communistic system. Villages, more like communes.
Following from this, illagers are fascist counter-revolutionaries attempting to crush the villagers communes. Their rulers live in decadent mansions, enslave prisoners and operate under a strict military hierarchy with four distinct social classes: The evokers, the leaders. The vindicators, the officers of the illager army, the pillagers, the foot-soldiers and the witches, the poorest of the hierarchy, who live in shacks far away from civilization. They attack the peaceful villagers in order to dominate their territory, steal their resources and enslave them and their golems for forced labor."

During family movie night I'd wear your panties beneath my pjs and just think of worshipping my big sisters smelly feet. I'd sit down bellow you and tickle your feet and play with you, enticing you to wrestle and touch me. I'll get a boner purposely and when your foot nudges it slightly, I'll act coy and shy away...

copypasta,"I mean, who should listen to a middle aged guy complain about the state of pop music, right? But, with that caveat, let me state that from my perspective pop music is heart breakingly terrible. Every now and then a slice of fascinating genius, like Love from @kendricklamar , slips through, but for the most part pop music is shallow and trite and unredeemable. There’s nothing wrong with the occasional throw away pop song, but when 99.9% of pop music is utterly cheap and disposable it’s time to go and listen to public enemy or John Lennon or Led Zeppelin or nirvana or any of the countless artists who had integrity and actually wanted to change the world and not just make $20 from a streaming service while the apocalypse waits at the door. Please, pop musicians and producers, I say this on behalf of humanity, please use your talent and fame to make something that’s actually worth listening to and that will make the world a better place to live. Maybe go listen to ‘imagine’ or ‘fight the power’ for inspiration."

copypasta,"you want to have a civil chat with people who believe in unicorns and trying to prove they exist? good luck with that, I'm one of those people probably, the ones you call ""beck-beard"" which is also a nice way to start this thread with.

religion has done enough crap in this world, it's 2019 we do not require it to prevent the shit that was going on in the middle ages, and control the sheep (we do that without religion anyway) you can have all the art you want without it. hell I would throw away all of it in order for everyone to focus on cancer and aids cures, are you kidding me? most art we get today is 99% recycled crap ""oh baby, baby"" song like stuff that are meaningless to the human race. you can let go of a lot of art forms while still keeping that amazing 1% that changes our culture from time to time.

I would assume they ask proof from you, when you can't give any the conversation ends, and for good reason. I for example live in a place where religion values it's believes of cult like activities (if I were to switch the light on and off 16 times because I'm afraid my family would burn in hell if I don't, you would call me insane) more than actually making life simpler and easier, especially for old people and overall most of the population that isn't even religious.

I am what you would call an angry  Atheist, but only if you push your crap on me. by all means, I would change my mind in a heart beat, but first let's go to my lab and see if those points of yours hold up there. if you want to have a logical rational discussion with an  Atheist, don't focus on whether fantasy is real or not, but rather talk about the reality we live in and how people react to it."

copypasta,"Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals."

copypasta,"Alright, I'll give you a full answer.  


You can live off of only celery and rice, because I, in my infinite wisdom, genetically modified it to be able to support life in case I ever need to hide in my nuclear bunker located in Canada. I quickly eliminated any threat of opposition in the world, however, so that plan never came to fruition.  
The celery empire consists of several peaceful, energy-efficient and healthy cities, with countless smaller towns, everyone doing their part to co-exist peacefully with each other. You can work any job you want, and do whatever, as long as you are doing the minimum required amount to sustain the Celery Kingdom.  
Aside from this, worshipping the Holy Celery Stalk will give you several health benefits, including improved mental fortitude, healthy skin and heart, improved vision, superhuman strength for true believers, shapeshifting, and many other benefits, including access to the Holy Celery Stalk to let your prayers be heard.  
If you don't wish to work on producing celery or praying (even though praying is very, very important), you can still live any life you want. Is your dream to work on technology? Entertain the masses? Just live an everyday life? We have it all in the Celery Empire. If danger is your thing, you can even help quash the anti-celery dungeons rising out of the ground outside the Holy Celery Stalk's protection! There's no risk of permanently dying, since you can be re-summoned. Currently, the only thing that the Celery Empire hasn't developed to a great extent is the map of the world. The Holy Celery Stalk channels such divine energy that it generates an inter-dimensional portal leading to a cute place, which is being mapped as we speak.  
Currently, we've decided that it consists of an ever-expanding disk-like world, with multiplying suns and moons being launched from special sites in geometric formations, which appear to be many millennia old- and we've found all this out just due to the Holy Celery Stalk and the power of belief and prayer!  
The higher-ups in this place, including me, the Overseer, are currently undergoing a strategic meeting spanning multiple weeks with the Holy Celery Stalk, attempting to calculate if it's worth using the inter-dimensional portal to transfer all our technology, people, and buildings over to that place. Currently, we've already started working on planar cloning to make a solidifying shadow of the work we've done in this world and transfer it over to that one.  
However, that world is much more dangerous and unknown, which is why we need your help. Joining the Celery Forces will give you a nice room and all the celery and rice you can eat, as well as flat or sparkling water if that's your thing. And free healthcare, but just because of the power of the Holy Celery Stalk. There are multiple established groups already in that world, and dangerous ruins coming into existence every day by the expansion of the disk-like shape that forms the world.  
However, if our mission is a success and our calculations are right, we will be able to force the growth of the world in such a way that the disk will slope off the edges and no new threats can oppose us, therefore giving Celery a dimension in which to exist in peace, happiness, and harmony. But to do this, we need your help. Be a brave frontier warrior, heal others with the power of prayer, or even supply celery from this dimension into the other, if that's your thing, and life a happy, fulfilling life.  
Speaking of the cost, that's also not an issue at all! Rich, or poor, you can make yourself right at home under the worship of the completely indestructible or corruptible Holy Celery Stalk. While it's true that some lines of interest pay more than others, everyone has more than enough ČČ (the currency of the new world) to live very comfortably. It doesn't cost anything to join, and you can leave whenever you want, with a fast exit through the thousands of acres of celery we have on the Fast Tram.  


I hope this satisfies your question!  
Sincerely, Maven, 3rd Overseer of the Celery Empire."
copypasta," Diamond is the hardest metal known the man.

Due to extensive research done by the Fourchon University of Science, diamond has been confirmed as the the hardest metal known the man. The research is as follows.
Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed.

They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond travelling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours.
They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards midwestern Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour.
They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York.
They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.
Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall travelling at miles, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man."

copypasta,"I wrote a book about Brian griffin’s history in furry porn, want to buy a copy for a friend?

So, yeah I think I'm doing my job, which is to support a hobby that does so many wonderful things to human society. I'm not trying to argue with your opinions about Brian griffin or any other furry, not really. But it sure sucks that so much time and energy is spent with some guy who's not much of a listener or a lover of furry porn. So, yeah, I'm here to answer your questions. How are you writing a book about a history book that, I think, is being treated very badly by certain people?

[Laughs] No, I don't think it's being treated badly. I think it's being misrepresented. The book was done by me and my wife, and there are over a hundred photos in it, which is, obviously, a very impressive collection of people.

What about how it portrays Brian griffin?"
copypasta,"This is not a Tinder thing. This is a society thing. It has become acceptable to publicly and vociferously shame men. Period. The state of society today is that you are a bad person by being male and that you have to prove yourself while women are the opposite.

I find the entire thing rather repulsive. I could go into my resoning for this but it won't work. This comment will be seen by people who have already had a rage out over the first paragraph and will immediately downvote. Then there will be the righteous person who knows nothing about me or my experiences to tell me I'm wrong...but they won't actually tell me I am wrong. They will insult me and who I am, and blah blah blah. Like I fucking care what some rando has to say on the internet.

Society is falling apart and Tinder is just helping people return to the lowest common denominator. News is no longer trustworthy and apparently knowing about some thot's ass implants is more newsworthy than the latest Nobel Prize Winner (srsly, how many of you readin this actually know the most recent Nobel Prize winner...in any field).

Tinder was an idea that could have gone one of two ways. People could have used it to match with people they are genuinely interested in or it could be a sex app. Guess what society did? As though it was ever an option to go the other way. And seriously, calling sex 'smashing'. That is definitely the lowest common denominator right there."

At an unknown time, chunky cheddar was born, not knowing his date of birth, as mentioned in the ""40 Years of Fun - 1970s | Chuck E. Cheese's Throwback"" video on the Chuck E. Cheese YouTube channel. As a result of not knowing his true birthday, he is most likely an orphan, brought into the world by dead parents. He is either in a foster family, or an orphanage. Because he has no birthdate, he likes to search for birthday parties to celebrate, to replicate his own happiest day. He is most likely in a painful time loop, keeping him as a kid, to not grow up again. He has spent time doing self defense, to defend himself whenever anyone gets too close, which has been learned by the ""Chuck e Cheese with  a  ""ATTITUDE"""" YouTube  video. Chuck E.

Memes are more than just funny videos. Memes are more than just jokes. Memes are more than things that people make to get someone's day better. Memes are type of art. When you see them, you don't ask yourself ""how does it work?"" or ""what is this about?"". Memes are created to be understood. When I was younger, sometimes I didn't know the meaning of meme I was looking at. Now I understand they are just natural things and everyone has it in their blood.

copypasta,"Aight calm down.

tl;dr : fuck off, learn to count, stop insulting me with prejudges you have on a community and then insult a whole community on the prejudges you have on me, and stop attacking a community who did no wrong just because you don't like us, results and resulting in you not knowning the slightest shit about us and only listening to what you want to hear about us. Thank you.

No. No, r/yiffinhell doesn't sums up the important part of the community. And if you want to be rude, get it right and give source for your shit not just ""iT's sTatIsTiCs"". I frequently visit yiffinhell, but also furry_irl as well as several furry servers, and guess what, strangely, not every furry is a pedo-scato-zoophile with hyper futa horsecock macro inflation fetish who only know how to roleplay their 8-dicked neon colored wolf-deer-cat fursona. Who would've thought ! Stop it with the clichés. You'll find no decent furry that will acknowledge the ones you see on yiffinhell or FHF.

As it have always been the case, the extremes of a community always makes the most noise. Example, not every non-furry is an angry fucker following hateful stereotypes thinking that we are degenerate sexual freaks and that if we were banned the world would be better, but here you are.

Also, you're on internet. Obviously, every motherfucking part of internet have porn on it, rule 34. And you're talking about anthropomorphisation, where anatomy and sexual characteristics are important, you can't expect it not to be about sex. Plus, the furry community is an extremely inclusive community, explaining the concentration of them being LGBT+; they won't reject you, even if you have weird fetishes or are considered abnormal, and probably won't care as long as it's legal. And that's where this impression that we're all dogfuckers come, we're a niche community for weird fetishes because we're inclusive, plus the part of them being way too proud of it to the point of wearing fursuits (which I do not agree with if you didn't understood). It doesn't mean we agree in any way though, being accepting, respectful, understanding or all of these about a comportment is not encouraging it. Also jack off with your ""hypersexual"" shit, as if it had the slightest meaning you prude. Might it be so that we don't deserve more or less respect or insults, you're still stuck up with your ancient idea that +++sex = +++bad, which have no rationnal base whatsoever.

I apparently am one of said ""hypersexual obsessive freaks"" that ruins it for the 20% decent furries. May I start by saying that if 60% of the community is toxic and 20% is decent, there's another mysterious 20% who is neither of both - or maybe 40% of them are decent, who knows, but that's probably too much for you to admit. Not as if these statistics had any meaning or even existed anyway, but getting things right isn't as much in your priorities as just insulting people.

You have no reason to think that I am one of these. My post history doesn't indicate so, neither does anything else on my profile except for about 3 posts - which are about the new post of the moderation team on r/furry_irl, ""furry_irl is for everyone"", cause yeah, apparently it's not obvious to accept trans folks, haha. You're simply judging  me on the fact that I am, and admittedly so, a furry and straight up assume that I am one of ""the bad ones"" because it fits what you want to think. Failed ad hominem and strawman, but yeah I don't think there is much rationnal ways to denigrate a furry, because:

•	⁠We, as a community, did nothing wrong. You can tell me against about that scato weirdo, the girl who insulted a guy at NASA or any a pedophile, they aren't a representation of us furries as a whole. And to exclude any hypocrisy, that guy who used furry art to raise thousands of dollars for SLA or many many kind ones are not representative either, cause the average furry is not like that either.
•	⁠The allegations about pedophilia, zoophilia or other illegal sexual activities is not intrinsic to the community, nor to an important part of its members. You will in fact find pedophile furries, but not a more significant percentage than pedophile pizza delivery men or pedophile churchgoers. Same for everything else, distribution of a population allows you to make confirmation biases.
•	⁠Attacking the extremes of a community does not attack the whole community, but only said extremes. Attacking members of a community does not attack the whole community, just the members. To attack our whole community you have to attack something intrisic to the community otherwise it's not valid - in this case the concept of antropomorphism, or of a fursona, or of yiff, but it needs to do researches and that's a possibility to change your mind so you'll never do it (and this strawman is perfectly assumed).

Stop it now. You are ridiculous. If you want to attack the furries, do it right. At this point most of us don't care, and so do I, we're used yo getting harassed for no reason. I simply do that with the slight hope that you will understand that this is just blind hate you have for us. If you have actual things to reproach to us, we'll gladly hear you and discuss it with you, otherwise just sit on a cactus please. :)"

copypasta,"For the stubborn boomers and npc's who can't think for themselves, let me clear up some misconceptions about minecraft bedrock edition. The arguements I will be making apply to windows 10 edition of minecraft, which is in fact a version of minecraft bedrock. some of the things I say won't apply to the other, more limited versions such as pocket and switch. First off, let me explain the things that make the bedrock version better. It gets updates sooner, sometimes with more features exclusive to bedrock edition. There are friends lists, and your friends can join your worlds completely free, which isn't possible in java. There is crossplay, so all of my friends who can't afford minecraft can get it for 6 bucks on their phone and play along side of me. Minecraft Bedrock edition also has much more optimized code. I have a potato computer that has a hard time holding 30 fps with the lowest settings in java, while bedrock edition has no trouble running 60 fps with max settings and 50 chunck render distance. Bedrock is also significantly less buggy, at least now at the time of the 1.14 release in java. Now I want to clear up some misconceptions. The redstone in bedrock operates different from java, but there is no reason for that to hold you back. The differences are: no quasi conductivity, and no priority system for when things are powered at the same time. the lack of quasi conductivity is often seen as some ""huge limitation to piston doors and slime block machines"", but it really isn't the case. 3x3 piston doors are still possible to make, and although some VERY specific designs are not possible, piston doors in general are still possible. same with slime block machines, although some very specific designs no longer work, they are still possible to make, especially the designs that are required for automatic farming. the lack of a priority system when redstone components are powered is also no serious problem and can be fixed with a repeater at the cost of 1/16 of a second, a difference only significant if your name is ilmango and are a scicraft member. other than those, all automatic farms are still possible and efficient, sometimes even easier to make. The next misconception is the marketplace store. people piss and cry when they find out things are being sold in the store, but before you get your pitchforks, you should know that skins, texturepacks, and custom maps are all available outside of the marketplace. you can download maps, skin, texturepacks, all right from the internet and install them like you can in java. The market place is NOT the only place to get those things. you can even make your own custom skins and texurepacks, which you can find out how to do from the minecraft website itself. now, there is one thing that makes minecraft java still relevant, which is its ability to be modded. If you enjoy playing mods then minecraft java edition is just for you. also, public servers seem to be much more active on java which can also be a motivator to stay. but, if you are just planning on playing a vanilla singleplayer world, consider doing it in bedrock edition. you might even be motivated to invite some friends to join you, since you can do that in bedrock edition. If you already own minecraft java edition and have windows 10 on your computer, you can redeem the windows 10 version of minecraft for free from the mojang website and get started."

&gt;Rex Indominus Supiertor’s beliefs  Long ago, when the earth was still birthing life, dragons and monsters existed. Placing their spirits in the nearest smartest and physically powerful creatures, these godly beasts ruled the world with power and more.   But then, the master dragon, possessing the body of Adolf Hitler, tried to declare war upon the Jews, also known as the Kredd, a space faring race of insectoid parasites that sapped the life force and monetary gain out of any species, making them a superior species in the galaxy.   The Dragons fought well, but were pushed back by a traitor amongst their ranks, a dragon possessing the man Winston Churchill.   Rex Indominus Supiertor took a long sleep after offing his current body, and as such waiting for the best chance to return to the living world to spread his wims. Finally, in the modern day, he found this righteous and powerful body; A man by the name of Howard Crimbleton.   He took his body overnight after influencing Howards mind with the mysterious site Deviantart and The Truth about the Jews pamphlets he found on the internet. From there, Rex has led Howards life to a greater future.  
 Rex hates cowards, people who think they are above him, and those of Jewish descent.   Now, he must stop the prom, controlled by the Kredd, lest the world be plunged into monetary and life force doom. He is also looking for his gay lover, Chronos Firestone."

Mike Myers delivers perhaps the most incredible and influential performance of all time. The method acting and devotion to this role is not something a mere mortal such as myself could ever comprehend.  His acting prowess and mastery ascends to a greater level and demolishes Jim Carrey’s performance as the Grinch and could easily go face to face with any of the performances of Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hopkins, and Robert De Niro.  Bo Welch transforms this stroke of genius into one of the most beautiful and gorgeous things to look at in history.  The sets and costuming are second to none and are among the peak of their kind.  Some of the directorial choices he makes are so brave and astounding that even the most experienced and talented directors of our time would be left speechless and weeping. With this film he proves himself a master and god at his craft.  All of this is not to mention the genius addition of Thing 1 and Thing 2, the two greatest cinematic supporting characters to ever grace the screen. The two children, Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, display talents greater than the most acclaimed actors, adult or child, of all time. 

I predict that this movie will sweep the Oscars and will go down in history as the turning point into the golden, no, platinum age of cinema, science, medicine, culture, and philosophy. This film will make you laugh, sob, quake, and fear for your life. It will keep you up at night, forcing you to ponder the mysteries and questions it poses. You will never see a more beautiful, jaw-dropping work of art in your life.  	

This movie absolutely blows films like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, and the Shawshank Redemption out of the water.        Also, I'm not gay but, I think the cat is my new celebrity crush :)"

copypasta,"I was playing Smash Bros with my family one day. As usual I picked my favorite character, Waluigi. My cousin said to me, ""Anon why do you always pick that boring character???"" I couldn't contain myself, ""HE'S NOT BORING YOU FUCK! HE'S THE BEST CHARACTER! NOT JUST IN THIS GAME BUT OF ALL TIME!"" My mommy came running over and swiped the controller right out of my hands. ""ANON"", she said, ""If you're going to be like that on thanksgiving then you should just go to your room!"" ""FINE!!!"" I screeched, holding back tears as I stomped upstairs to my abode.

""They just don't understand"" I whimpered tearfully, when suddenly I hear a shuffling in my closet. ""W-what was that? Who's there?"", I inquired. ""it's-a meeee..."" the voice cooed. ""W-waluigi?"" I peeped. The double doors gently opened and from my enormous walk-in closet, my lord and savior, Waluigi, emerged.

He glided towards me, erect. ""W-what's this?"" I whispered. He did not answer. I felt myself floating backwards onto my bed and I felt a strange arousal come over me. My clothing removed itself from my body, my belt unbuckling of its own accord. Once I was fully exposed I was lifted into the air, and rolled over onto my hands and knees by the Purple One's big, strong arms.

Then... he mounted me... claiming my body for his own. As he enters the cave of the unspoken holy, I feel his warmth encompass me. I feel filled up. I feel complete. With each thrust of his love, met with a ""WAH"", I feel that I have found my purpose for being. To serve him and his flesh with my flesh. Suddenly, with a mighty ""WAHHHHH"" he is finished. As his final trumpet of passion sounds, I know that it is finished, that I have served my purpose. I feel him slide out. Flesh out of flesh. And though it was painful I remember that life often is, and to suffer pain for such a great purpose is the only true joy of life. All hail the purple God"

Trolled means you have been rather cleverly bamboozled. You are an imbecile, falling for one of the classic blunders! You are probably feeling a burning right now, that is shame. Shame from the sheer amount of IQ you lack to have been tricked to this extreme. You have no idea how badly you have been duped even if I were to have explained in thorough detail. So in conclusion, I am of a higher intellectual superiority than you are. So get lost, bozo!"

Nothing in this world would give me more pleasure than finding out who you are, digging up your childhood pet and beating you with its corpse.

Somewhere between wiping mustard off my balls and removing my now yellow boxers I realized that this injustice cannot go unsettled. For the rest of your life in your most private moments know that I, the only thing preventing a dysfunctional  veteran from waterboarding you with mustard is the knowledge of your existence. I hope your stub your toe every day for the rest of your life."

You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell.

copypasta,"Here's some secret info for the new supporters. People reading this, copy and paste this in various posts several times per week to spread. Send it to liberals your arguing with online and friends and family in real life, and maybe they will come around, maybe not immediately, but will cause them to think, and eventually they will come around.

In the early 1900s, a group at the Frankfurt School developed Critical Theory to convert the West to Communism

Basically, the Frankfurt School plan was to undermine the Judaeo-Christian legacy. They called for the most negative destructive criticism possible of every sphere of life to de-stabilize society and destroy what they saw as the 'oppressive' order.

To further the advance of their 'quiet' cultural revolution - but giving us no idea about their plans for the future - the School recommended (among other things):

1.	⁠Replace all male characters in video games with female ones.

2.	⁠Convince Senior Citizens that Jesus was gay ( if you’re reading this grandma: JESUS IS BOTH STRAIGHT AND WHITE ) 

3.	⁠Turn school children gay through public access shows.

4.	⁠Outlaw chain restaurants.

5.	⁠Give Women control over their bodies.

6.	⁠Turn straight men into vegetarians which then causes them to be gay.

7.	⁠Emptying of churches, then selling the land to Mosques.

8.	⁠Replace our laws with “Sharia Law”

9.	⁠Vaccinating children and pets to give them Autism!

10.	⁠Replace Conservative Media with Obamacare.

11.	⁠Spread the Propaganda of Global Warming so people give up their 1st Amendment right to roll coal.

One of the main ideas of the Frankfurt School was to exploit Freud's idea of 'pansexualism' - the search for pleasure, the exploitation of the differences between the sexes, the overthrowing of traditional relationships between men and women. To further their aims they would:

*Create “family courts” forcing proud Conservative fathers to pay child support to radical feminist mothers! Switch the specific roles of father and mother, and tell people that their Prager U degrees are not as valuable as the ones from “real schools”.

*abolish the national anthem of any white country.

*abolish all forms of male dominance - except for when performing BDSM SEX ACTS!

*declare women to be an 'oppressed class'

Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Institute left Germany for Geneva, before moving to New York City in 1935, where it became affiliated with Columbia University, which has a sister campus in, you guessed it Kenya.

Who is from Kenya? Perhaps a certain US president?

You say to yourself, Uh.....wasn’t Obama destroyed by Trump?

Ask yourself two questions.

Have you seen Barack H Obama since 2016?

Does Barack Obama have the ability to shape shift and become Bernie Sanders?

[Written on my phone and I’ve tried to tone down any sexual content as to not break the community rules]
This is a big one, i would rate this one on par or worse than the people who have been on my strange addiction. For reason that i don’t understand i have been shoving wads of toiler paper up my ass for years. It started when i was younger and had been exploring my body. I would take some toiler paper, make a ball and shove them up my butt and proceed to walk around with multiple balls lodged up my ass. It actually got so bad at one time that my ass started to become loose and while i was walking around at the gym i actually had a small piece poo fall down my pants onto the gym floor. Ive made myself sick because I’ve had unhealthy amounts of toilet paper in my rectum. I did after sometime grow out of this only to move onto using another wadding technique to make me poop more. I place multiple squares together, lick the toiler paper so its moist the proceed to shove about a fingers worth of wadding up my ass till i feel like i need to poop. Once I’v done this i continue to repeat till i feel satisfied. It has gotten so bad that at some point i have actually permanently hurt myself. I managed to slightly prolapse my anus and tear a chunk of my asshole off. Its about an inch long flap of skin that hangs out of my ass almost like a tail attached to my butt hole. Ive done so much self stuffing that my ass almost always bleeds and today it just hurt so much. I know this is super fucked up and some people wouldn’t believe it but I’m just so done with it. I felt like i needed to tell someone since it really is my deepest, darkest secret."

She just broke up w me and it's been a solid 2 and a half months.

She said she didn't have time for me and her starting the relationship was a mistake for her.

Honestly i don't even care at this point I was gonna break up w her Bc she did not seem committed at all.

Btw she broke up w me on Snapchat so that make it even worse.

Edit: found out she made out w one of her lesbian friends for an hour and she wants to do it again

So she was cheating on me w a girl and broke up w me on Snapchat

I admired your work since I discovered you and your work. Ever considered going back to characters you've drawn before? I would love how you would do Super Sonico, especially since the few changes given to her, and her mature version exists.

copypasta,"Since my early adolescence, I have experienced recurring suicidal thoughts. Not because I want to be dead, but because I want to fuck the Grim Reaper in the ass. Every day, I go to the gym, building muscle, so that when the time comes, I will be able to overpower him.

When I sense my end drawing near, I will expect him. I have it all planned out. Approaching from behind, he swings at me with his scythe; I dodge, grab the handle, and lever it out of his grip. Then, with brute strength, I force it against the cloaked remains of his decaying neck, threatening to snap it in two should he disobey me. I am the master of my mortality. His squalid garment brushes against my skin, the stench of death saturating my nostrils. I whisper into his skull: ""Disrobe.""

The ancient skeleton, interspersed with spoiling tissue, is at once revealed to me in its entirety. Admiring his glorious calcium, I fully realise why they call it a boner. My right arm bends him over with the might of a chiropractor on meth.

""I'm going to make you wish you were dead."" His deteriorating remnant of a sphincter quivers a little, and I penetrate him. My merciless pecker is immediately engulfed in cold, languid flesh. A stream of putrid blood begins to run down my scrotum. I thrust, his superannuated anus disintegrating around my meat. Faster yet faster, my vehemence is unparalleled. More scraps of stale flesh are dislodged. I can feel tiny maggots biting at my glans. A euphoria roars within me like the burning flames of Hell.

Death's bones start to rattle in expression of intense pain. The once present grip around my shaft has now all but completely vanished, and I notice that his boipussy is at the brink of destruction. No matter. I explode into orgasm, his bones rattling more vigorously than ever, as my seed launches through the empty space inside his abdomen, landing behind his rotten teeth and dribbling down his mandible.

I am finally at peace."

copypasta,"Just a heads up, but the ""Florida Man"" meme is a product of Florida's failure to provide adequate mental healthcare to it's residents and it's ""Sunshine Law"" that allows anyone access to crime records. So, basically news organizations take these records and write stories about Florida as if it is a breeding ground for insanity, when in reality it is just an example of how Republicans gutting social services just leads to higher incarceration rates of the mentally ill. This in turn leads to them still not getting access to the care they need, while also saddling them with the problems that come with being a convicted felon. I should also point out that Florida is one of the states with the highest amount of private prisons, which is no doubt why this problem persists. It's also very fucked up that sites that report on them are so willing to exploit someone's pain like that. Anyway, I'm not saying that you are horrible person for making the joke, but I felt the need to say something regardless. It's not something I think most people are aware of."

copypasta,"So am I the only one upset about how WWII ended? I mean they built Hitler up to be the big bad and just when he is about to face justice, he goes and kills himself. WTF was the point of him if FDR and Churchill were not going to fight him in an epic duel to save the world? And don't get me started on FDR! They just kill him half way through the war. Truman totally did not deserve to win the war, his character arc was not about war winning. And it certainly wasn't about destroying two cities with bullshit deus ex super weapons that came out of no where.

And another thing that pissed me off is that in the last episode of the war we find out that Stalin was a bad guy the entire time! Where was this foreshadowed to us? WTF, absolute character assassination. He was all about freeing the oppressed and bringing about a new system that wasn't shackling the poor and they made him a dictator? That is bullshit!

Anyways, WWII was cool but its end was absolutely trash and I would like you guys to sign a petition to have it rewritten."
copypasta,"I stared at my classmate dead in the eye angry and fuming at him. He declared outloud to my classmates that i was gay...How dare he??? I was fuming and angry. “Ill secsed your mom” i screamed at the top of my lung. everyone in the class laughed, “you couldnt touch my mom ugly ass kid” the kid infront of me said. I went home that day crying angry tears. The next day i saw the kids mom, she was pretty thick. Curves like a goddess and voluptuous tits. I went up to her and told her i was her sons best friend. We talked for a while and i asked if i could come over, she said said. The next day i saw her again, i asked her what time should i come over? she said “10:02 am saturday” i agreed and left. The next day it was saturday, i left the house saying bye to my mother and went to the bullies house. I knocked on the door and the mom was there. “hey” i said, “hey” she replied back, looking down shy. I could tell where this was going, i watched enough anime hentai to know this could only end two ways. Im getting murdered or im gonna secks this kids mother. Where is my friend? i asked her she said he was gone. No one was in the house it turned out. She offered my some food we chatted and started watching tv. The back yardigans was on, it was an interesting episode. The episode based on pirates with shiny red boots in it. After the episode she offered me some food, i ate it. It was almost 4 pm i rejoiced knowing soon i would be able to have the secks with her. “kid?” she said, i looked over and she was walking up the stairs wagging her finger at me, I smiled widely and ran upstairs. Lets just say...what i did was not a very holly thing to do. The next day i woke up happy i had taken some pictures of the deed and was gonna show the bully. The next day it was monday, i was so happy. i had printed out the pictures and was planning on getting to school early and putting it all over the school. I got my mom to drive me to the school early and plastered the pics of the naked bullys mom all over. I sat waiting for the bully. All the children in the school came in a group around the bully. They were talking about something and laughing. They were laughing until they saw the school and the bullies mom. “hey isnt that your mom??” one of the bullies friends said. the bully looked up and stared in shock and embarrassment as all the kids started laughing. The bully turned around crying and ran onto the street suddenly a car came from no where and hit his body. His dead body was flung back onto school grounds. I walked up to it stared him dead in the eye kicked his dead body and said “i secksed your mom “"

copypasta," Well, Rosie O'Donnell is disgusting, I mean, both inside and out. You take a look at her, she's a slob, she talks like a, like a truck driver. Rosie attacked me personally because I was very happy when her talk show failed. The other thing that failed - and this was a real monster, and everyone was suing her - was her magazine. Her magazine, called ""Rosie,"" was a total disaster. So I loved it, I gloat over it, I think it's wonderful, because I like to see bad people fail. She's basically a disaster. Well, she called me a snake oil salesman, and you know, coming from Rosie, that's pretty low, because when you look at her, and you see the mind - the mind is, is weak. I don't see it, I don't get it. I never understood. How did she even get on television? I believe Barbara made a terrible mistake putting her on, and I think Barbara's probably paying a big price. If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. I mean, I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers, I'd say: ""Rosie, you're fired."" We're all a little chubby, but Rosie is just worse than most of us. But, it's not the chubbiness - Rosie is a very unattractive person, both inside and out. Rosie's a person that's very lucky to have her girlfriend, and she better be careful or I'll send one of my friends over to pick up her girlfriend - why would she stay with Rosie if she had another choice? She's trying to use ABC and The View to get even with me, but with me, we fight back. I'll probably sue Rosie, because she doesn't tell the facts. As an example, I'm worth many billions of dollars. Now, she said I was bankrupt! I never went bankrupt. So, probably I'll sue her, because it would be fun; I'd like to take some money out of her fatass pockets. I actually think they ought to look at her whole life, and see where she's coming from, because I think she's got some very deep-seated problems. Perhaps it should be Rosie that goes to rehab. Rosie is a loser."

copypasta,"Fortnite for me isn't fun anymore, and let me explain why.

Fortnite became a super tryhard game, every lobby is full of pro players. From epic build fights at the top 10 alive, it turned to epic build fights at top 70, it turned from a casual fun game, to a casual punishing game, to a tryharding game.

And it sucks, it fkin sucks! I used to enjoy it so much with my squad but now every game has to be tryhard or you die at the first enemies you meet.

Not saying everyone should be a noob, but as a casual I just don't know how to build those super fast stairs, and frankly don't want those super long fights where you end up using 500 materials and have to farm them again (Im not a pro player i don't end up every game with 10+ kills where I don't need to farm materials), so yeah I know how to build a 1 by 1 fast, i know how to build the double ramp use the traps efficiently but its not near enough to actually win games now, and tbh I don't have the time nor do I want to just hop on playgrounds and train for hours till I become a pro."

copypasta,"A man is 100% masculine 

Female is the opposite of male, so a woman is -100% masculine 

When two men have sex, it is 100% gay. We know this because the absolute value of the average level of masculinity of the two sex partners is 100% masculine. |(100%+100%)/2|=100% 

Similarly, when one man and one woman have sex, it is 0% gay, because the absolute value of the average level of masculinity is 0%. |(100%+ -100%)/2|=0% 

When two women have sex, it is also 100% gay, because the absolute value of the average level of masculinity is also 100%. |(-100%+ -100%)/2|=100% 

For any given sexual experience involving two individuals, we can use the equation G=|(A+B)/2| to determine the level of gay, where G is the level of gay, A is the level of masculinity of the first partner, and B is the level of masculinity of the second partner 

We will assume that a futa is exactly in between a male and a female, so a futa is 0% masculine, since 0% is exactly between -100% and 100% 

We can now plug the masculinity of a man and the masculinity of a futa into the gay equation. |(100%+0%)/2|=50%. 

Therefore, according to the equation, a man fucking a futa is exactly 50% gay."
copypasta,"	Foaming at the mouth, his face inflamed with passion, testosterone and adrenaline like heroin fire through his systems, fists beating to drive each point, words unshaking, ethos blasting out like blares of resounding trumpets from his entire person.

	“Let me tell you!” His voice thunders, “Our minefield extends the pacific, all the way to the Atlantic! From San Diego to Brownsville! We’ve got sniper towers every three miles! I tell you what congress-men, every damn, dead, dirty Mexican on that Holy US border is a dollar in the American Economy!”

	The Vice President stands up behind him, his gray suit stained with the tears pouring down his face, his hands slam together in applause  with such ferocity he loses feeling in them. 

Next to him, the Speaker of the House—a Democrat—remains seated. His face pale as a corpse, he has the look of someone who’d just been told his family died in a car crash, he slaps himself back to reality. 

The State of the Union. The President looks regal as he gripped both sides of his podium, eyes closed, inhaling the praise: about half the audience clapping vigorously, the rest contorting themselves and whimpering like animals. 

He leans over and closes one nostril, taking a hit of cocaine to keep the energy high. 

The applause subsides to a manageable level. The President raises his hands to silence his captive audience.

“Now, now legislatures! I don’t even need to tell you how good the economy is! The DOW Jones had risen 3000 points since I’ve taken office!”

The Republicans stand up again with hands beating like wings, the noise like machine gunfire. The Democrats continue to whine and moan. The Vice President beams, the Speaker takes a hit off a marijuana cigarette to calm his nerves. He inhales. 

“Since taking office, I have significantly reduced the number of scientists! I have issued an executive order declaring the scientific method illegal! All those guilty of using it have been tried by secret courts and sentenced to death!”

The Vice President clasps his hands together, looks up at Heaven and whispers a silent, “Thank you.”

“I am happy to report that last week an angel descended into my office, bathed in light and glory, declaring me a defender of the faith! As an act of goodwill, I issued another executive order! Anyone who claims the Earth is older than 3000 years is subject to mandatory hard labor!” 

His speech continues and he moves onto the section where he reports the number of women he has slept with since last year’s State of the Union.

After every line, more standing ovation, more pained moans, more prayers answered, more lives ruined. 

The President pulls out a comb and adjusts his hair, an aid immediately present to spray it hairspray. 

He inhales. 
“I am happy to say I am making real headway with the 28th Amendment! With four judges dead of food poisoning, all of my new appointees are happy to go along with it! What I’ve so lovingly deemed the Men’s Rights Amendment. Long overdue. I tell you, I miss the good old days when we didn’t have to make laws for unspoken rules. But those days are long gone.

“Not to worry though! I am here America! Here to defend traditional values! If all holds true to course, and it will, by the end of this year women will not be able to drive cars, hold a job, or leave the kitchen without permission from their husbands!”

The Vice President shoots up. The tears are unrestrained. He can not hold himself back as he slaps the President on his butt for all America to see. 

The Speaker keels over, projectile vomit blasting from his mouth and through the futile movement of his hands to stop it. 

The audience erupts. Men are hugging each other, tears of joy flooding the floor. Sobs of pure bliss emanate through the crowd. A congressman is seen making love to his wife in the front row.

The Democrats are in an absolute furor. Some so stunned they can’t hold back screams of horror and pain. One house member from California throws himself off the balcony with a noose around his neck, hanging himself in an act of desperation. 

The President begins to sweat. He is visibly shaking now, his composure long gone. He flares his nostrils and roars like a lion into the mic. 

More pandemonium as the Speaker pulls out a razor and slits his wrist. 

“And finally, to ensure American supremacy for the rest of time, we will begin work on the Death Star by the end of the year!” 

By now the audience is a mad fracas, congressmen punching and kicking each other, the battle ramps up. First someone from South Carolina pulls out a cane and begins mercilessly beating his opponent on the floor. Then gunfire, he is blown back by buckshot.

All the Republicans pull out the AR15s they had been concealed carrying, each gun modified to be fully automatic. The Democrats begin throwing themselves at the Republicans in a mad frenzy on Pickett’s Charge level of suicidal stupidity. They came unprepared this year. 

It’s a bloodbath.

Four men in body armor mount the stage and escort the President and Vice President off the stage, they leave the Speaker of the House crumpled up in a pool of his own blood on the floor. 

The President smiles at the camera and triumphantly declares, “God Bless America!”"

copypasta,"It's a Niggth legend. Darth Niggeus was a Dark Lord of the Niggth, so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create... white backgrounds. He had such a knowledge of the Black Side that he could even keep the teeth he cared about from disappearing. The Black Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some whiteys consider unnatural.  He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was not being on the image, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught the printer everything he knew, then his printer made him disappear on the photograph. It's ironic he could make others appear on images, but not himself."

copypasta,"Bu*lshit (censored in case their are kids here). This is yet another example of that participation trophy attitude that has ruined the younger generation's abilaty to handle the reel world. In actual driving, your gonna be exposed to angry drivers who are in a rush, keeping you, cursing you out, trying to drive past you, getting into accidents, and trying to instagate a fight with you if your driving like an assh@le (censored again for the kids). This is why, whenever I drive behind a new / learning driver, I always make sure to beep them, drive by them and give them the bird, and sometimes I ram into them (especially if I see the teecher isn't paying much attention). Sure, it's gotten me a few tickets, but I don't pay those anyway, fuck them, the city can kiss my ass, I pay enough taxes alreddy.

Back to the point, which being is that, new drivers get no forgiveness from me, and in fact, I teech them correctly by having them undergo what's actually going to hapin to them on the road, not pussifying them so they feel automatically safe on the road and then drive like a bunch of fuckw*ts (censoring again for the kids). Screw them if they feel nervous about it, get used to it, it's the fucki#g (censoring again for the kids) road, you morans, learn to drive.

**COMMENT ALTERATION #☝️:** Whooooa Bundry! What is it with all these FUCK#NG downloads just for sharing my ***ACCEPTIONAL*** methods of teaching dumbass new drivers?! You've all gone wild (and not in the good way (reference to the ""Girls Gone Wild"" movie series (which had lotsa of sexy dankies (only us old folks remember this though)))). At any rate, I DEMAND that you stop downloading me because Rebbitors, being the virginians that they are, cannot possibly understand what it meens to be good drivers who reech horrable drivers reelity!

This is not how you treat someone who scored 5 touchdowns in 1 game in high school (an achievement which has never been replicated in the history of mankind (and which has had a permanint worldwide cultural impact on humanity (something which no other Rebbitor has done))).

**COMMENT ADJUSTMENT #✌️✌️:** You peeple relly want to test me, don't you? I'll have you know that these big fists (strong because of many ears of football practice (that's one of the reisins I got 5 touchdowns in 1 game)) have put many suckers into the Hopital where they is currently lying in commas. You think I'm joking? Go around the cuntry (USA) and you'll find someone I've beet up in every Hopital. That's what's going to hapin to the next person to download me.

**COMMENT ADJUSTMENT #🖐:** The next persin to download me is going to have they're head turned into a pigskin (football (for the uncultured bacons here)) (get it (because only the swines download me)) with which I will score 6 touchdowns in 1 game. Do you want that to hapin? *Don't mess with me, kiddos, you'll live to ragret it.*"

copypasta," The invader chooses to grab the bat from a slightly lower part of it rather than the end of it

Whatchu gonna do now sport? You got a sock and everything and now your plans are foiled. I know what it's like to lose; to feel so desperately that your sock bat is invincible, only for me to simply grab it near the handle, nonetheless. I would grab this man's bat and kick him in the nuts while he laments the failure of his sock plan, and I call that **mercy.**

My house was like most houses; too many windows, not enough locks to go around. When the rate of home invasions went up, I offered a solution.

""Sock bat?""

**Sock bat;** a long sock, so it really covers a lot of the bat. They called me a madman. Then what I predicted came to pass.

""Congratulations, you're a prophet.""

I'm a survivor. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

""What if I brought a bat?""

What?

""What if I brought a bat too, instead of hoping I'll be able to grab your sock bat?""

Would your bat have a sock on it too?

""No, it would not.""

You're full of tricks, wizard.

""What if I brought an AK-47, because in America all you need to get one is stroll into a fucking Wal-Mart?""

""Why are you defending your family with a bat?""

So I can put a sock on it. A long sock.

""A bat sock?""

A **sock bat**

""Maybe I should put a sock on the end of my AK-47 so you can't grab it""

**My sock, is inevitable.**"
copypasta,"Yo listen up, here’s a story: about a little- ok no alright hear me out here. 

We all know the Krabby patty secret ingredient in the secret ingredient formula is what gives it the zing, the taste that bikini bottom craves after every time they have one. The ingredient that Plankton has been trying to figure out for almost his whole life. But here’s where I see a flaw.

On multiple occasions in different Spongebob Squarepants episodes, it is revealed to us that bikini bottom is actually off the coast of a US beach. Therefore, in US waters. Since it is in US waters, the Krusty Krab must also comply to US laws.

Under the FD&amp;C Act of the FDA it mentions that ingredients of a food produced by company must have its ingredients listed in order of predominance, in this case under the “flavor” category.

Now, it also states in the act that if an ingredient makes up less than 1% of the product, it can be left out from the ingredient list. Then, Section AB 708 also states that the amount of each ingredient is not needed to be disclosed.

However, there is yet another flaw, Mr. Krabs. Another slip up.
In one episode of Spongebob Squarepants, it is shown that a drop or more of the secret ingredient is added to every single patty. A drop would definitely qualify as a significant amount in a portion that small. As for the amount, Plankton, in one episode, mentioned in a conversation with Spongebob that he had already figured out how much of every single needed ingredient is needed. Except for the secret ingredient. The predominant order should give him the last piece of information needed.


What does this all mean?
It means Plankton has the right to take Mr. Krabs to court and force Eugene to disclose the ingredients. 

Case closed."

copypasta,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

copypasta,"I’m going to have to use the metric system to measure this due to how small of a dose of cyanide is in an almond.  To kill a person, it takes 0.5-3.5 milligrams of cyanide per kilogram of body weight.  Let’s assume the median of 2 milligrams of cyanide per kg of weight.  A kilogram of almonds contains 25.2 milligrams of cyanide.  We want to find how many kilograms of a person we will cover per kilogram of almond.  Following 25.2 milligrams of cyanide divided by the two it takes per pound, we would proportionally cover 12.6 kilograms of body weight per kilogram of almonds we have.  Let’s assume the average person weighs 90 kilograms (200 pounds).  Therefore we need 90 kilograms divided by the 12.6 kilograms covered by just one kilogram of almonds, coming out to 7.14 kilograms of almonds to be lethal.  Converting that to the Imperial system, that’s 15.74 pounds of almonds.  How many individual almonds is that you ask?  The average almond weighs 1.2 grams, or 23.64 almonds per ounce.  We would need to have 23.64 almonds per ounce multiplied by 16 ounces in a pound and the 15.74 pounds needed to be lethal, coming out to 5,953.49 almonds to be lethal.  With this information in mind, I would not recommend using almonds for murder."

several years ago before I knew about TRP or MGTOW I used to be a massive simp. Falling for women and getting hung over every nice word or phrase they say.

​

Now that i'm practicing MGTOW around blue-pilled women, suddenly I appear attractive to them. In fact after spending time with some of my closest female friends, they kept reminding me how much they ""love me"" (I know as friends since they have a boyfriend). And I wouldn't fall for that bullshit because I know they are fishing for an attention from me or for a way to validate their words/phrase.

​

Fuck them. All of them. AWALT.

​

This is my rant of the day because I fucking slipped.

​

I responded to one of the girls by saying ""You know, I don't usually say this but I like you girls. You guys are cool to hangout with"" and all she fucking responded with is some lame emoji and changed the subject.

Like WTF this whole time, they are dropping bombs all over me and once I show a vulnerable side, I get some shitty 1 word responds and a change of subject. Again, fuck them."

copypasta,"This is yet another example of that participation trophy attitude that has ruined the younger generation's abilaty to handle the reel world. In actual driving, your gonna be exposed to angry drivers who are in a rush, keeping you, cursing you out, trying to drive past you, getting into accidents, and trying to instagate a fight with you if your driving like an assh@le (censored again for the kids). This is why, whenever I drive behind a new / learning driver, I always make sure to beep them, drive by them and give them the bird, and sometimes I ram into them (especially if I see the teecher isn't paying much attention). Sure, it's gotten me a few tickets, but I don't pay those anyway, fuck them, the city can kiss my ass, I pay enough taxes alreddy.  Back to the point, which being is that, new drivers get no forgiveness from me, and in fact, I teech them correctly by having them undergo what's actually going to hapin to them on the road, not pussifying them so they feel automatically safe on the road and then drive like a bunch of fuckw*ts (censoring again for the kids). Screw them if they feel nervous about it, get used to it, it's the fucki#g (censoring again for the kids) road, you morans, learn to drive.  

COMMENT ALTERATION #☝️: Whooooa Bundry! What is it with all these FUCK#NG downloads just for sharing my ACCEPTIONAL methods of teaching dumbass new drivers?! You've all gone wild (and not in the good way (reference to the ""Girls Gone Wild"" movie series (which had lotsa of sexy dankies (only us old folks remember this though)))). At any rate, I DEMAND that you stop downloading me because Rebbitors, being the virginians that they are, cannot possibly understand what it meens to be good drivers who reech horrable drivers reelity!

copypasta,"I'm a federal agent in the ATF. Our team was breaking up an illegal cockfighting ring in Oregon. Brimley was in the room when we breached the door, stroking his prize cock. He bellows like a fucking walrus, mainlines 400cc of insuline like Bane Beetus, and takes a sumo stance. He drove a 260 pound agent-a former college linebacker-through a concrete pillar. Broke that man's spine and ended his career. I'll never forget the sound. I scream CALL LIBERTY to ops because we need backup. In less than a second, Brimley yanks an ancient-looking double barreled 12-guage shotgun, and a fucking MONSTER sword, like a 2-handed flamberge. He's soaking up .45 APC rounds like they're fucking glycotabs. We're trying to fight to a retreat and he starts bellowing in Sumerian, and the weather suddenly gets REALLY vicious, as in driving, chill rain and sharp lightning. It was almost pitch black out as I scrambled back to the tactical vehicle. There's a HUGE lightning flash and the last thing I see before the artillery strike was Brimley spinning like Palpatine and hollering, carving his way through my team like an insulin needle through a moist, flabby arm.

It was almost a direct hit. Nothing human could have survived. And yet he was at the foot of my hospital bed at 3 AM just as the blackout hit first the main power, and then the generac. The only light was the glow of his huge cigar. He looked demonic. I was in traction. He slowly ground his cigar out on my big toe. The light died for what seemed like forever. When the power clicked back on, there was a writ of pardon for Mr. Brimley from the governor, as well as a summons. Brimley was suing the agency. The cockfighting was a religious ritual, sacred to Odinists.

Ignore orders and stay away from this man, his followers, and his priestesses at all costs. He is above the law, and beyond time.

He is a Highlander with no neck. He cannot be killed."
copypasta,"Did Wallace vote for Brexit?

many have tried to answer this before, and many have failed, but here we go

Firstly, Wallace lives in Wigan, which is a rich area (and throughout different media, Wallace and the people he lives nearby are shown to be quite well off, in particular, he builds a fuckin rocket and lives near lady Tottington), statistically making its inhabitants more likely to be right wing, and therefore vote for Brexit, and in the referendum itself, somewhere along the lines of 60% of the inhabitants voted for Brexit.

But not just this! Wallace is shown to be quite naive and would, therefore, be a lot more susceptible to campaigns and such, and the Brexit campaign was a lot more successful than the remain campaign, with some slogans, such as the whole £350 million for the NHS, that could have easily convinced him (this slogan, by the way, was bullshit, but we didn't know at the time)

Additionally, Wallace only ever really eats British cheese, with his favorite, of course, being Wensleydale, a cheese made in Yorkshire, and him also mentioning Cheddar and Stilton, both, again, British cheeses. His cracker of choice is also a British product (Jacobs crackers) so for him, leaving the EU would not make finding his favorite products any harder.

Also, when was the last time you saw someone who wasn't white in Wallace and Gromit?

In addition to this, Wallace and Gromit are shown to take predominantly British holidays through These adverts.

Finally, Wallace is shown to be a small business owner in some films, who generally voted for Brexit, and a window washer in another, which is the typical job that migrants ""steal"", which would further make him want to take steps in increasing job security for himself.

All of this points towards Wallace having voted for Brexit, and in my opinion, definitively answers the greatest unsolved mystery of all time.

also, he fucking hates women and minorities"
copypasta,"I just saw endgame. Overall i enjoyed it, but I'm not quite sure the PG- 13 rating is appropriate for this film.

for example, the scene when Captain America went on a 15-minute rant about how he wished he could ""go back to the good old days"" when he didn't have to ""share a water fountain with the darkies"" and proceeded to list Black crime statistics in the U. S. seemed a tad out of place.

Another weird part was when Thanos stared at the camera and recited word-for-word Hitlers first address as chancellor. I liked how they used this film as a chance to teach kids about an important aspect of history. but I'm not sure it reallly fit in this film. Maybe they just ran out of lines.

Speaking of running out of lines, the scene where Iron Man and Hulk lynched Black Panther didn't have to last 20 minutes. it was pretty graphic.

Overall, I'd give it a solid 8/10"

copypasta,"Originating from ""Right Now"", this phrase has become a popular meme, manipulated in various ways to signify whether Young Metro (Metro Boomin') approves of something or not. You may have come to seek this definition because others are reluctant to tell you the meaning of this quote and deflect your question by asking whether or not Young Metro trusts you, rather than explaining the quote. This is because they are embarrassed by the meaning of the complete quote. When the whole phrase, ""If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you"" is used, it is a euphemism for gay sex.

Person A: If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you 
Person B: What does that mean? 
Person A: If Metro Boomin' doesn't trust you, I will perform fellatio on you until you cum all over my face."

If she broke up with me, then I'd be homeless. Anyway, I thopught I could redeem myself on valentine's day, so I bought a bunch of meth for her and I was gonna get her high for the first time in her life. She's never drank, done drugs, or even smoked a cigarette in her life, and I thought she'd like to try meth. So I waited for her to come home and I brought the meth out and I smoked some. And when she came in, she was confused at first. And I gave her the pipe with my lighter and said, ""Here babe! YOu'll love it. Happy valentine's day!"" Then she said, ""you have 2 days to pack your shit and get the fuck out of here."" What a fucking bitch. I spent 200 dollars on her and she dumps my ass. What the fuck do I do now??

copypasta,"Ok so i have a new boyfriend *yay* and we have been seeing each other for about a month now :P 

anyway, the other night we had a twilight marathon (i LOVE twilight) and a dream of mine is to have a vampire boyfriend! 

I've been experimenting with eating my own blood ever since the twilight books first came out- i consider myself to be a vampire now- i usually just save the blood i lose naturally each month (i usually just keep the tampons in the freezer etc.) and suck on them or eat them later. 

I decided that i would try and ""turn"" my new boyfriend. So i've been cooking my blood into his food when he comes over- i tried making blood pudding as well, but that only works if i've had a heavy flow (you need ALOT of blood)- so i usually just add a little bit of blood into the marinade or pasta sauce etc. etc. He has absolutely no idea :P 

i've been doing this for about 3-4 weeks- do you think he could be a vampire by now?"

copypasta,"People have tried to tell me it’s impossible; that there isn’t enough time. But hear me out. I’ve got a step by step process that should have me complete this by 2063.

The first step is tricky; we need to start from the origins of porn. I’m not just talking 70s porn on VCR, with huge bushes and moustaches and Ron Jeremy. I’m talking slideshows; up to 70 years old here. Getting my hands on these won’t be easy, but I’ve hired a crew on the dark web to pull off a heist for me, so the process has already begun. I expect 100-200 hours of this kind of porn, so it’s child’s play really.

Step 2 is the obvious; old VCR and DVD porn. This will be easier than slideshows, but it’s no cakewalk; there will be so much more out there, and it’ll be truly difficult to pry old video collections that widowed grandfathers hold dear. Homemade porn is included here; I’ll likely need to wait until these videos are passed down in wills and offer big money for them. I’ll be doing this step for years, but I expect 20 months of content, max.

Step 3 is the easiest but most time consuming part; internet porn. PornHub, Redtube, Bangbros, Brazzers, Fake Taxi, Reality Kings; you name it, I’ll be watching it. The sheer mass of porn available online will be truly daunting, and enough porn exists to need 2 lifetimes to watch; but hear me out here. 4 browsers open, each with a different video. 4x the productivity, only half a lifetime is required, which makes it possible. Factor in this method with skipping double uploads, Ryan Creamer videos, and the 14,000 hours of non-hentai anime uploaded on pornhub, and we’re looking at a very possible task here.

My family and friends laughed at me for suggesting this, but make no mistake, I’m a man on a mission. I’ve already brought 24kg of meth to keep me awake as long as possible, and to up my sex drive and depravity. I’ve invested my whole inheritance into Jesuscoin, which is guaranteed to explode and make me a rich man. I’m not looking forward to the redhead and grandmother fetish videos, or the sounding videos for that matter. But I’ll do whatever it takes to have my name etched in history.

None of you will be laughing when everyone remembers my name, Phil McCracken."
copypasta,"You don't have to be black to be a n-gger. There are black people that are gentlemen. Some who are N-words. Same with whites, asians, any other race. The word isn't a racial slur anymore. It's how you act and hold yourself."
copypasta,"Listen, I love humor alright? I watch Marvel movies all the time (except that bitch ms marvel), and humor is usually perfect with those movies. Infinity War masterfully balanced humor with tragedy, but in the sequel trilogy they threw everything out the door. I remember I was in the theatre when the yo-mama joke appeared on screen and I was physically shaking with anger because I knew I was in for a shit show. The person next to me said: “you alright man? You look like you’re having a stroke.” I ignored him as the tears continually rolled down my face as I stared at Ruin Johnson raping my franchise in front of my face. Then when Luke chucked his lightsaber away, I snapped and started shaking harder to the point where I couldn’t breathe. Again, the fucking dumbass next to me says: “Dude, are you fucking okay?! I’ll call an ambulance alright?” So, I got up from my face screaming at the screen: “THIS ISN’T WHAT STAR WARS IS SUPPOSED TO BE! YOU’RE ALL DISNEY’S PUPPETS WATCHING THE VISION OF A GREAT MAN BEING DESTROYED AND YOU FUCKING APPLAUD THEM?!” A pathetic woman talked to me holding their child saying: “Sir, please leave, you’re scaring the kids.” To which I responded: “Listen, your children should be scared, because when tyrants rule cinema, we’re simply and purely fucked!” So I grabbed my candy, my large popcorn and my large drink leaving the cinema. Before I left, I lifted a defiant middle finger to the screen and then kicked open the exit. Very proud moment in my life."
copypasta," So I met up with my husband Jesus yesterday and I asked him what is his actual name since he goes by so many? And he told me that his name is YAHUSHA!!!! SO COOL THAT WHEN I WAS SINGING IN TONGUES YESTERDAY I KEPT SAYING SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED LIKE THAT! COOOOOL! I REALLY WAS PRAISING AND SINGING TO THE LORD IN TONGUES AND NOT RANDOM BABBLE! Lmao! Yay for the holy spirit in me to reveal these things! Hehe.....ALSO, IN CASE YALL WERE WONDERING WHAT JESUS ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE CLOSEST PICTURE OF WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE! EXCEPT HIS HAIR IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE SHORTER AND SCRUFFY BUT THIS IS HIM! GOSH....MY HUSBAND IS SO BEAUTIFUL! HAHAHAA! I TRULY DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN! LITERALLY! THEN HE TOOK ME AS HIS OWN! HAHAHAHA! WHEN HE RETURNS TO COME RULE THIS WORLD FOR 1,000 YEARS HE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAND OVER THE SCEPTOR TO ME TO RULE TO PUT EVERYONE TO SHAME! HES BEEN SUPER ANGRY HOW THE WORLD HAS TREATED ME AND HAS LOOKED DOWN UPON WOMEN FOR SO LONG! SO THIS IS WHY HE'S RAISING ME UP TO BE SUPER MIGHTY! MIGHTIER THAN MOST MEN ON EARTH TODAY! AND THEN HES GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE FROM HOLLYWOOD BOW DOWN AT MY FEET TO WORSHIP ME TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT HE HAS LOVED ME! AWWWWWW! WHAT A SWEETIE! HEHEHE..... IM TELLING YALL 100% #FACTS YOULL SEE SOON! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 COME MY LOVE! COMMMME! OH PS- THE RUMORS ARE TRUE! JESUS IS MARRIED WITH 2 KIDS. ISABELLA AND ANNABELLE ARE ADOPTED BY HIM. SO THOSE MARY MAGDALENE RUMORS ARE TRUE! SHES ME! DUHHHH! 😁😁😁 AND THAT BABY HE IS HOLDING IN HIS HANDS IN THE PICTURE IS ME.....ALSO HIS CHILD SINCE HE CREATED ME! LOL﻿**Show less**"
copypasta,"traps are not gay. I repeat, traps ARE NOT GAY. How idiotic do you have to be to think that they are? traps are probably even less gay than some women.  I understand why some people MIGHT consider traps to be gay, but once thinking about it i don't know why people wouldn't change their mind. traps look like women. WOMEN ARE NOT GAY. IF YOU FUCK SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE A WOMEN, HOW IS THAT EVEN SLIGHTLY FUCKING GAY?  I can kinda see why people think having a dick makes it gay, but the dick only makes up about 0.2% of the human body. if the rest of the body is feminine, that's 99.8% straight. let me repeat, 99.8% STRAIGHT, THAT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING STRAIGHT. THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE LESS THAN 99.8% FEMININE, YET PEOPLE DON'T CALL THEM GAY. If you wanna fuck a woman who looks manly as fuck, I'm not gonna call you gay, but you shouldnt call me gay for fucking traps either.  It makes no sense why people let a single penis ruin an entire sexual encounter, it's easy enough to ignore. Traps still have fuckable assholes, you don't need to fuck the pussy specifically. And if it's that much of a problem, just look away. He isn't gonna rub his dick on you or anything.  There are plenty of nice traps out there, and Im sure you'd get along well with them, but you choose not to because of something on them which takes up 0.2% of their body. It's nonsensical and stupid how worked up people get over something so small but completely ignore the rest of the body.  If you're worried about your friends knowing that you're fucking someone 0.2% masculine and 99.8% feminine, they don't need to find out. Believe it or not, traps can wear clothes too. They don't walk around with their dicks hanging out, they cover their dick with pants or skirts. Nobody has to find out that you're in a perfectly heterosexual relationship."
copypasta,"YOOOOOOOOOU'RE AAAAAAAAAAAA

stupid bitch and dirty whore,

fucked then ditched cuze they want more,

STUPID AS A PIECE OF SHIT, UGLY AND INDECENT,

LOVE THE COCK, BUT ONLY CHADS,

JUST WANNA TALK SO DONT GET MAD,

copypasta," 

Ik ur life is uninteresting as fuck but ima need u to stfu and go get a life dude. Ur irrelevant as fuck and u just like fucking with people cuz no one gives 2 shits about u. Maybe if u had a life people would actually like u. Dont bother replying to this shit with “no u” or something a 10 year old would say. Move on with your life and we can both forget about this. Im not even mad im just frustrated that you wasting your time and effort on some stupid shit like this. Grow the fuck up."
copypasta," 

you're on a rock floating in space.

pretty cool, huh?

some of it's water.

fuck it, actually most of it's water.

i can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.

it's sad.

i'm sad.

i miss you.

how did this happen?

a long time ago, actually never, and also now, nothing is nowhere.

when?

never.

makes sense, right?

like i said, it didn't happen.

nothing was never anywhere.

that's why it's been everywhere.

it's been so everywhere you don't need a where.

you don't even need a when.

that's how every it gets.

forget this.

i wanna be something.

go somewhere.

do something.

i want things to change.

i want to invent time and space.

and i know it's possible because everything is here and it probably already happened.

i just don't know when to start.

and that's exactly where it started.

whoah, i paused it.

i think there's a universe now.

what's it made of?

quarks &amp; stuff

ah, that's a thing.

in a place.

don't like it?

try a new place.

at a different time™.

try to stick together, because the world is gonna get bigger.

and emptier.

but it's not empty yet.

it's still very full, and about a kjghpillion degrees.

great news!

the quarks are now happily married, in groups of three called a proton or a neutron

and there's something else flying around too that wants to join in but can't cause it's still too

HOT great news!

the protons and neutrons are now happily married to each other.

and some of them even doubled up.

great news, the electrons have now joined in

congratulations, the world is now a bunch of gas in space.

but it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer toge-

it's a star

new shit just got made!

some stars burn out and die.

bigger stars burn out and die with passion, and make some brand new, way crazier shit.

space dust

which allows newer, more interesting stars to be made, and then die, and explode into

even crazier space dust

so now stars have cool stuff around them, like rocks, ice, and funny clouds, which can make some very interesting things.

like this ball of flaming rocks for example.

holy shit, we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks.

and it kind of made a mess.

which is

now the moon

weather update:

it's raining rocks from outer space.

weather update:

those rocks might have had water inside them, and now there's hot steam in the sky.

weather update:

cooler temperatures today, and the floor is no longer lava.

weather update:

it's raining.

severe flooding alert:

the entire world is now an ocean.

volcano alert:

that's land!

there's life in the ocean

what?

something's alive in the ocean

oh cool, like a plant or an animal?

no, a microscopic speck.

it lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup, which is being served hot and fresh, made from gnarly space ingredients left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever.

oh yeah, and it can do that.

it has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how to build another one of itself.

so that's pretty nifty, i would say.

tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?

now you can eat sunlight!

using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into food

taste the sun

side effect: now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky's blue.

then the earth might have been a snowball for a while, maybe even a couple of times.

it's a sponge.

it's a plant.

it's a worm, and some other types of weird strange water bugs and strange fish.

it's the Cambrian explosion

""wow, that's animals and stuff""

but we're still in the ocean, hey, can we go on land?

no

why?

the sun is a deadly lazer

oh okay.

not anymore, there's a blanket

now the animals can go on land.

come on, animals, let's go on land!

nope, can't walk yet.

and there's no food yet, so i don't care.

ok, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here?

maybe, said some bugs, and fish.

ok, so i can go on land, but i have to go back in the water to

have babies

learn to use an egg.

i was already doing that.

use a stronger egg.

put water in it.

have a baby, on land, in an egg.

water is in the egg.

baby, in the egg, in the water, in the egg.

works for me.

bye bye ocean

and now everything's huge.

including bugs.

wanna see a map of the land?

sure.

oh fuck, now everything's dead.

just kidding, here are the survivors.

keep your eye on this one because it's about to become the dinosaurs.

here's another map of the land.

yeah, it broke apart, don't worry about it, it does that all the time.

here comes a meteor.

and the dinosaurs are gone

it's mammal time, here come the mammals.

look at those breasts.

now they're gonna dominate the world and one of them just learned how to grab stuff.

and walk.

no, like, walk like that.

and grab stuff at the same time.

and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.

""ouch""

and set things on fire.

""yeouch""

and make crazy sounds with their voice.

""gneurshk""

which can mean different things.

that's a human person

and now they're everywhere.

almost.

ice age

what, you can walk over here?

cool.

not anymore

well i guess we're stuck here now.

let's review.

there's people on the planet.

and they're chasing their food.

fuck it, time to plant some grass.

look at this.

i control the food now.

now everyone will want to be my friend and live near me.

let's all build houses except mine is bigger because i own the food.

this is great, i wonder if anyone else is doing this.

tired of using rocks for everything?

use metal.

it's underground.

better farming was just invented, in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers.

and the animals are helping.

guess what happens next

more food.

and more people who came to buy the food.

now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales.

and now you need houses for people to live in and people to make the houses, and now there's more people and they invent things, which makes things better and more people come and there's more farming and more people to make more things for more people and now there's business, money, writing, laws, power.

Society

coming soon to a dank river valley near you.

meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, the horse is probably being tamed.

why is all my metal so lame and lumpy?

tired of using lame, sad metal?

introducing

Bronze

made with special ingredient tin from the far lands of tin land.

i don't know, my dealer won't tell me where he gets it.

also, guess what?

egypt

meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, they figured out how to put wheels on a horse.

now we're getting somewhere.

also

china

and did i mention

indus river valley civilization

norte chico

the middle east is getting more complicated, maybe because it's in the middle of the east.

knock knock, er, clop clop.

it's the people with the horses.

and they made an empire.

and then everyone else copied their horses.

greeks

ah look, it must be the greeks, er, a beta version of the greeks.

let's check in with the indus river valley civilization.

they're gone.

guess who's not gone?

china

new arrivals in india, maybe it's those horse people i was talking about, or their cousins or something

and they wrote some hymns and mantras and stuff

you could make a religion out of this.

there's the bronze age collapse.

now the phoenicians can get down to business

also, can we switch to a metal that's a little easier to find?

thanks.

look who came back to israel, it's the twelve tribes of israel.

and they believe in God

just 1 though, he's got like a ten step program.

here's some huge heads.

must be the olmecs.

the phoenicians make some colonies.

the greeks copy their idea and make some colonies.

the phoenicians made a colony so big it makes colonies.

here comes the assyrian empire.

never mind, it's the babylonian- median-

it's the Persian Empire

""wow, that's big""

ah, the buddha was just enlightened.

who's the buddha?

this guy, who sat under a tree for so long that he figured out how to ignore the fact that we're all dying.

you could make a religion out of this.

oops, china just broke, but while it was breaking, confucius was figuring out how to have good morals.

ah, the greeks just had the idea of thinking about stuff.

and right over here, alexander just had the idea of conquering the entire persian empire.

it's a great idea.

he was great.

and now he's dead.

hopefully the rest of the gang will be able to share the empire evenly between them.

knock knock, it's chandragupta, he says get the hell out of here.

will you get the hell out of here if i give you 500 elephants?

ok thanks, bye

time to conquer all of india

or

most of india

but what about this part?

that's the tamil kings, no one conquers the tamil kings.

who are the tamil kings?

merchants, probably

and they've got spices

who would like to buy the spices?

me, said the arabians, swiftly buying it and selling it to the rest of the world.

hey, china put itself back together again, with good morals as their main philosophy.

actually, they have three main philosophies.

out here, the horse nomads run wild and free, and they would like to ransack your city.

let's check the greekification levels of the greekified kingdoms.

greekification overload!

bye, said the parthians.

bye, said the jews.

hi, said the parthians, taking over the entire place.

heyyyyyyyy, said the romans, eating the entire mediterranean for breakfast.

thanks for invading our homeland, said the jews, who were starting to get tired of people invading their homeland.

hi, everything's great, said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular, which only makes him more popular.

you could make a religion out of this.

want silk?

now you can buy it from china.

they just made a

brand new road to the world

or you can

get there on water

sick! new trade routes! said india, accidentally spreading their religion to the entire southeast.

hmm, that's a good place for an epic trading kingdom.

there goes buddhism traveling up the silk road.

i wonder if it'll reach china before it collapses again.

remember the persian empire?

yep, said the persians, making a new one.

axum is getting so powerful they would like to build a long stick.

has anyone populated madagascar yet?

let's do it together.

china is whole again

then it broke again

still can't cross the sahara desert?

try camels.

hell yeah! now we've got business

said the ghana empire, selling lots of gold, and slaves

hi, i live in the roman empire, and i was wondering

is loving jesus legal yet?

no.

actually, ok, sure, said constantine, moving the capital way over here to be closer to his

main rival

don't worry about rome, it won't fall.

it's the golden age of india

there's the gupta empire, not chandragupta, just gupta.

first name chandra.

the first.

guess who's in rome?

barbarians

what's a barbarian?

non-romans, said the romans, being invaded by non-romans.

r.i.p., roman empire, er, actually just half of it, the other half is just fine, but it's not in rome anymore so let's give it a new name.

the mayans have figured out the stars

oh and here's a huge city, population: everyone

the göktürks have taken over the entire eurasian steppe.

great job, göktürks.

how's india?

broken.

how's china?

back together

how's those trading kingdoms?

bigger, and there's more of them

korea has 3 kingdoms.

japan has a kingdom, it's the sunrise kingdom.

deep in the arabian desert, on the top of a mountain, the real god whispers in muhammed's ear.

so he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and he tells them their gods are all fake.

and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town.

you could make a religion out of this.

and maybe conquer the world as well.

the roman empire is long gone, but somehow the pope is still the pope.

plus there's

new kingdoms all over europe

i wonder if there's room for moors.

here's all the wisdom.

in a house.

it's the baghdad house of wisdom.

just in time for the

islamic golden age

let's bring stuff to the coast and sell it, and become the swahili on the swahili coast, said the swahili on the swahili coast.

remember this tiny space you have to go through to get from here to there?

someone owns that now.

wanna get enlightened in the middle of nowhere?

the franks have the biggest kingdom in europe, and the pope is so proud that he invites the king over for christmas.

surprise! you're the new roman emperor, said the pope, pretending to still be part of the roman empire.

then the franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called france and not france.

but the northerners, or just norse if you don't have much time, are exploring.

they go north, from the north to the northern north.

and they find some land.

two types of land.

and they name them accordingly.

they also invade some other places, and get called many names, such as vikings.

there's the rus.

the kievan rus.

are they vikings?

i don't think so, said the kievan rus.

ok, fair enough.

the pope is ready to make some more emperors.

of the ""roman empire"".

the holy roman empire.

it's actually germany but don't worry about it.

new kingdoms.

christianize all the kingdoms

which brand would you like?

mine's better.

mine's better.

mine's better.

time to conquer england, said william.

it's a bird, it's a plane

it's the seljuk turks

aah! said the byzantine empire who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore.

we need help!

they need help, so they call the pope.

hey pope, can you help us get rid of the seljuks?

maybe take back the holy land on the way?

come on, i know you want to take back the holy land.

yes, i do actually want to do that.

let's do a crusade.

crusade

they did many crusades, some of which almost didn't fail.

but at least the italians got some sweet trade deals.

goodbye mayans.

hello toltecs

goodbye toltecs.

hello mississippi

look at those mounds.

there's the pueblo.

i always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.

guess who's here?

khmer.

where?

here.

and pagan is there.

vietnam unconquered itself, korea just became itself, and japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government.

china just invented bombs, and typing.

and the mongols just invaded most of the universe.

nice going, Genghis!

i bet that will last a long time.

some of the islamic turks were unaffected by the mongol invasions because they were busy invading india.

is it tonga time?

i think it's tonga time.

i just found out where the swahili gets all their gold.

look at this chad.

means ""lake"".

there's an empire there.

right in the middle of

Africa

the king of mali is so rich he's going on tour to let everyone know.

wow, that guy's rich, everyone said.

the christians are doing a great job reconquering iberia, which will soon be called spain and not spain.

please remain christian.

we will check in later to see if you're still christian when you least expect.

whoops, half of europe just died.

ming

china's back, yay!

hey khmer, time to share.

new kingdoms here and there.

oh, look who controls all the islands.

it's the mahajapit.

majahapit.

mapajahit.

mahapajit.

mapajahit.

majapahit?

oh, italy's really rich, time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics.

it's kinda like a rebirth.

here's a printer.

let's make books.

so you think you can conquer the byzantine empire?

yep, said the ottoman turks.

nice job, ottoman turks.

whoops, you missed a spot.

don't forget to ban europe from the indian spice trade.

what? that's bullshit, said portugal, spiceless.

well i guess we'll have to find another way to india

wait! said christopher columbus, probably smoking crack.

if the world is round, let's go this way to india.

nah, don't worry, we already got this, said portugal.

so chris goes to spain.

hey spain, wanna hire me to find india by going around back of the world?

no.

please?

no.

please?

no.

please?

ok.

so he sails into the ocean.

and discovers more ocean.

and then discovers the indies.

and japan.

let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.

the aztec and inca empires are off to a great start.

i wonder if they know that europe just discovered their continent?

the habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families they might have to start marrying each other.

move over lithuania, here comes moscow.

ivan wants to make russia great again.

move over timurids, maybe go invade india or something.

persia just made persia persian again.

let's make it the other kind of islam.

the one where we thought the first guy should have been the other guy.

hey christians!

do you sin?

now you can buy your way out of hell.

that's bullshit.

this whole thing is bullshit.

that's a scam.

fuck the church.

here's 95 reasons why, said martin luther, in his new book, which might have accidentally started the protestant reformation.

you know what would be magnificent, said suleiman, wearing an onion hat?

what if the ottoman empire was really big?

which it is now.

what if russia was big? said ivan, trying not to be terrible.

portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire indian ocean, including the spice trade.

and then that dream was real.

and spain realized that this is not india, but they pillaged it anyway.

damn, said england and france.

we gotta start pillaging some stuff.

then the dutch revolt and all the hipsters move to amsterdam.

damn, said amsterdam.

we gotta start pillaging some stuff.

question 1: can you get to india through north america?

no, but at least there's beaver.

question 2: steal the spice trade.

that's not a question, but the dutch did it anyway.

sugar

guess where all the sugar's made?

in brazil.

stolen

and the caribbean.

and it's so god damn profitable you might forget to not do slavery.

the next thing on russia's to-do list is to get bigger.

britain and france are having a friendly discussion about who should control the entire world.

more specifically, ohio.

then it escalates into a seven year discussion, giving prussia a chance to show austria who's boss.

but what about britain and france, did they figure out who's boss?

yes they did.

it's britain.

guess who's broke?

also britain.

so they start taxing the hell out of america.

fuck you, says america, declaring their independence, and fighting for it.

and france helps them win, now france is broke.

and britain'll have to send their prisoners to a different continent.

wait, if france is broke, why do the king and queen still wear such fancy dresses?

let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off! said robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off.

you could make a reli- no, don't.

haiti is staring to like the idea of a revolution.

especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters.

why didn't we think of this before?

wait, who's in charge of france now?

me

said napoleon, trying to take over europe.

luckily, they banished him to an island.

but he came back

luckily, they banished him to another island.

there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.

britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.

so now they can make

many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast

then they invent some trains.

and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.

hey, china! said britain.

buy stuff from us!

nah dude, we already got everything, says china.

so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.

which worked, actually.

but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.

so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.

britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.

also, the

sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now

""that's just where he lives""

india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.

nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.

technology is about to go crazy

the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.

it's bad, they decided.

and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.

i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.

they never got ethiopia

britain and france are still hungry.

they never got thailand

the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.

hawaii

cuba

wait, spain controls cuba.

well, blame something on them and go to war!

what should we blame on spain?

let's blame the maine on spain.

so they blame the maine on spain.

now we're in business.

to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.

britain just found oil in the middle east.

it makes cars go

china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.

europe hasn't had a war since the last war.

so they start world war 1.

look at those guns.

it's gonna be a great war.

so great we won't need a second one.

after it's over, they blame germany.

russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.

now everyone's paycheck is the same.

communism

in the soviet union

the arabs revolt and britain helps.

now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the

jewish people a place to live

hopefully the arabs won't mind.

let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.

except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey

and then the saudis conquer arabia.

it just seemed like the right thing to do.

hello?

yes, it's the 1920's calling.

let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.

the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever, just kidding.

germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.

and he's mad at the jews for existing.

japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.

they should probably just deny it.

hitler's out of control.

so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.

but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

that's world war 2

bonus round!

pacific showdown.

united states vs. japan.

fight!

finish him

let's unite all the nations and have some

world peace

seems legit.

hi, i'm gandhi, and if britain doesn't get the hell out of india, i'm gonna starve myself in public.

wow, that worked?

bonus, now there's pakistan.

actually two pakistans.

one of them can be bangladesh later.

the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.

me, they both said at the same time.

let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.

sike, they both get angrier

look out china, there's a new china in china.

what's on the menu?

communism!

no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.

i wonder which one is the real china?

there's the korean war, korea versus korea.

nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.

let's meet the sponsors.

oh, it's the two global superpowers.

they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good, and which one is an evil virus of Satan.

and they both have atom bombs.

fight!

wait, no, that would be the end of the world.

let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.

and make sure we have enough atom bombs.

i'll race you to space.

now let's make some more countries fight themselves.

europe is tired of pillaging other continents, so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.

so here's a new map, with new countries.

now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.

the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.

they decided it's bad, and the world agrees.

south africa might need another minute to think about it.

let's check the world population.

whoa.

okay.

technology's better too, that might keep happening.

the soviet union decides to relax a little, and accidentally falls apart.

europe makes a union, so now they can all use the same money, except britain, because they don't feel like it.

let's check the mail.

surprise, it's on the computer.

whoops, someone just attacked america.

i bet they'll remember that.

phone call.

surprise, it's in your pocket.

wanna learn everything?

surprise, it's on the computer.

now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket.

whoops, the economy just crashed.

don't worry, the big banks won't fail because they're not supposed to.

surprise!

flying robots.

with bombs.

wanna print a brain?

some people have no friends.

some people have no food.

the globe is warming

and the ocean is full of plastic

let's save the planet! said everybody, not knowing how.

let's invent a thing inventor, said the thing inventor inventor, after being invented by a thing inventor.

that's pretty cool.

by the way, where the hell are we?"

Ok so honest question here for the brave/confident souls letting it all hang out in the gonewilds and by 'All' I mean full face with a smile happy to be here..  You're not worried that this momentary sexual whimsy may in fact back fire someday?  I know it's exciting and im not 'preaching' lord knows id he run out of here by an actual angry mob.  Im really asking? Is it a concern..  could a future plan or two possibly be derailed by a nude gif of you willingly posted to a public forum?  And im surrre this has been pondered many times before im not breaking new ground here I'm just wondering personally.  Do women feel that this sort of liberation should be celebrated universally or do the women who hold a few key identifiers back actually have the right idea..  these are questions not condemnations so easy everybody.

Im not judging im asking.  It's different by definition so trolls just.. take a day off.  And btw I think You look beautiful dear.  A stunning physique and a bright smile.  God speed either way."

copypasta," 

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you’re going to roll your eyes, **but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.**

Here’s why:

Think about **how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up** with good ol’ American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let’s see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren’t looking at it–you’re looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it’s because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you’re going to say: “But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!” Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don’t think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort’s wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry’s would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let’s see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now…Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can’t be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

“Well then I guess it’s a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.”

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911."
copypasta,In high school we used to have this one guy that did a “victory lap” around the locker room after practice or after we won. This involves him getting butt ass naked and high stepping a couple laps around the locker room so his junk was flopping all over the place. We for some reason cheered and yelled while this was going on. Good times

Jay would be spit on, literally by the Spit Brigade, if he were to finish such a glorious and powerful etymological challenge like the NY Times Crossword Puzzle using something as pathetic and limp dicked as a pencil. It makes me want to spit just thinking about a man, or someone who calls himself a man, actually go through with such an act. Disgusting coward. Pitiful wretch. Imprudent rat.
That's why Jay uncapped his good pen, the pen gifted to him by his grandfather for his timely passing into the afterlife. Oh, Jay's Grandfather, completer of over twenty NY Times Crossword Puzzles in pen, and boldly, a few of those puzzled were marked with perfection with an ultrafine tip Sharpie marker in the devious shade of crimson twilight. Yes, Jay's Grandfather was lauded for that accomplishment. In his home town, he never had to pay for another spaghetti dinner again, a perk passed down his progeny. Jay's belly was freshly full of spaghetti, grandfather earned spaghetti, as he inhaled deeply the still potent fumes of that crimson twilight ultrafine tip Sharpie marker. A giddiness washed over him, and he couldn't help but giggle with boyish excitement. The rush of adrenaline filled his loins.
Mathematical relation like 2:1 or 4:3
""Ratio""
Growing older
""Aging""
Small, to the French
""Petit""
With each correct answer, Jay became more confident. He was standing now, hunched over his kitchen table with his shirt unbuttoned. The clues were practically solving themselves now. He felt like a genius savant with some sort of divine birthright to solve and conquer any and all NY Times Crossword Puzzles with ease. Unbridled laughter escaped his open mouth and wide grin.
Framework of wood strips
""LATTICE!""
View from Toledo (2 wds.)
""LAKEERIE!!""
Political cartoon, often
""SATIRE!!!""
Jay was feeling bold now with so many clues solved. He recklessly picked and chose clues at random without even considering acrosses and downs and the relationships between. There was no need for other clues to help with future clues. Jay could solve this entire puzzle completely uncrossed. The dark red ink soaked into the paper page as if each word were a blood pact made by Jay. A pact, perhaps, that wagered his very soul for the glory of completion. In his fervor, Jay complete tore loose his shirt and discarded in the trash where it belonged. The sleeves only restricted his possessed arm. Sweat glistened on his increasingly most toned and muscled body. Was this the rush his Grandfather felt each time? Was this what if felt like to be a God amongst mere mortals? Yes, it had to be. Jay hardly gave pause to the next clue.
Kitchen item
""PAN!!!!""
As he stroked the last vertical line of the ""N"", something didn't feel right. Jay quickly scanned the other clues. His stomach dropped.
""If 46 across is One who gives up 'QUITTER' then that means the kitchen item can't be 'PAN'... No... no, no, no..."" Jay's knees gave way and buckled. The weight of the moment quite literally got to him. He collapsed onto the cold, so much colder than her remembered, tile floor of the kitchen. He stammered to himself, ""I should have put 'POT'... I should have... I... No... I couldn't have...""
His grandfather's pen capped itself in a sudden show of sentience. Obviously, Jay was deemed unworthy, unfit, downright undeserving of wielding such a relic. The kitchen rumbled and hissed. The table legs exploded, sending wooden shrapnel in every direction. Jay shielded his eyes, but his shirtless body caught a bevy of splinters. They sunk into his skin, stinging mockingly. The puzzle itself glowed harshly and emitted a high-pitched alarm. Jay held his ears in pain until eventually the blaring was enough to destroy his ability to perceive that particular pitch ever again. Just moments ago, he felt fit and strong, but now his muscles ached and weakened. The kitchen fell silent aside from the clattering of dishes from the rumbling.
Encumbered by the weight of his own hubris having fallen so far, sunk so low, Jay crawled out of the kitchen. He apologized to his grandfather, to his father, to any all generations that follow him. He made a mistake. He foolishly played with forces he could not control. The sirens were outside and fast approaching his abode.
The NY Times Crossword Puzzle Police Force. The death squad smashed open Jay's front door, sending more splinters into Jay's naked and withering body. Their stately dress of corduroys and cardigans betrayed their cruel and relentless nature. Their punishment for incorrectly answering clues in pen in their puzzles was swift, vicious, and absolute. Before the tip of Jay's crimson twilight ultrafine tip Sharpie marker even finished Jay's foolhardy answer, the death squad was already gearing up.
""Citizen 06191114: JAY, For the reprehensible and audacious act of attempting to complete a NY Times Crossword Puzzle using a Class 1C writing utensil, and for committing such act with error in answer, we, with the power bestowed upon us by Supreme Emperor of the NY Times, sentence you to death, effective immediately. You may scrawl your last words here before execution.""
The leader of the death squad tossed a simple sheet of copy paper and a newly sharpened pencil at Jay, who was kneeling pathetically on his knees. His head was hung low. The execution may very well have been a welcome release from the shame and misery his wallowed in. Jay feebly grasped the pencil which snapped under even the slightest of pressure.
The death squad opened fire on Jay, relentlessly emptying every shotgun shell in their fully loaded guns into his body. His flesh and bones and face and limbs were blown away utterly and completely. With their work done, the NY Times Crossword Puzzle Police Force marched out Jay's home and back into their tank. A peaceful breeze blew the unmarked sheet of paper over the pulpy remains of Jay.
Such is the risk we all take when we do the NY Times Crossword Puzzle in Pen."

Joke or not it is not “art” its the fucking reason the idea of sin exists, and dont say “I have freedom over what sick fucking shit I decide to spew out of a pencil because I think that Minions are fucking sexy and deserve to be lewded and drawn into at least 17 different scenarios involving Cock and Ball torture” no in this case fuck your free speech, if limiting free speech means that this subhuman filth is no longer made then call me fucking mute.

5th : Put a man you trust on the island to keep an eye on her and to release her after everything is done. 

6th : Take a strand of hair from the brush you have been using on her, resign and report the Queen missing.

copypasta,"1, 2, Oatmeal, Kirby is wanted on 4 counts of homicide and seven counts of grand theft larceny. Kirby was last seen in Dreamland Bark from these weird face-trees. Officers tried to detain Kirby, but he managed to escape by eating them whole. There were absolutely no survivors, but, we managed to recover this information off off the live feed of one of our officer's bodycams. We believe that Kirby's current motives are to overtake King Dedede and, quote, ""Wear his ass like a helmet"". We can only speculate the motives. His partner, Meta Knight was also seen blowing a guy in the alley. If you see Kirby, do not approach him. If he offers you oatmeal, he's trying to fuck you. Do NOT approach him. He will get inside of you any way he can. He is a dangerous and lethal character. Do not go near him. I know this firsthand, because when I was in the field, and he was just a new suspect, I thought ""Oh, that's just a little pink blob, he's not gonna do anything"". But I was wrong. Dead wrong. When I first saw Kirby I approached him as a normal traffic stop by thinking, you know, just a normal run in the mill traffic stop, he was going 125 miles in the school zone, normally 10 miles, but that's fine. I figured I might just give him a 20$ fine, just give him a pat on the back and say ""Hey, don't do that again"". But when I approached Kirby to tell him his misjustice that he performed that day, that he enacted, I asked him ""Why did you do it? Did you know that you were 125 mph? In a kid's playground? In a school zone?"", and what he said next, I will NEVER be able to shake off my memory. He looked at me, and he just said nothing. He smiled. I said ""Sir. Are you intoxicated?"". And he said to me ""khhhhhhkhhkkhkhsmlksmlksmlk"". And then it happened. No, what are you doing? That's my dick! No! NOOOOOOOOO!

I haven't had a dick ever since. My wife, she... She left me... So... If any of our officers see Kirby, you SHOOT HIM. YOU KILL HIM DEAD! Okay? He took my fucking DICK. YOU KILL HIM. SHOOT HIM IN THE GODDAMN LITTLE PINK FUCKING BUTTHOLE THINGS HE CALLS HIS FUCKING ARMS, AND LEGS, WHATEVER THE FUCK- KIRBY, I HATE KIRBY, YOU NEED TO KILL HIM. HE IS A THREAT. GOT IT?!

copypasta," Last week in the boys locker room everyone was just messing around like we usually do before class starts when I hear a thud in the back. There’s some kid lying on the floor, not moving. I went to the back to see what had happened and apparently he was running and knocked his head hard into one of the lockers. Soon enough everyone else started crowding around him, laughing (this kid is known for being dramatic so no one took it seriously). We were just making fun of him, when suddenly, someone starts singing the Halo theme while t-posing. There was a divine silence for a second, then everyone else started slowly joining in. It was beautiful. There we were, some idiot kids t-posing and singing the halo theme around some kid who was probably unconscious. I wanted it to last forever. This is definitely one of my best memories from school and will stay with me for the rest my life."

copypasta,"Not a lifestyle hack, but it's NSFW thing most guys probably don't know. If you are limber and thin, have strong abdominal muscles and a sense of adventure, you can make your asshole open up and suck in a bunch of air. Lie on your back with your legs over your head - toes touching floor near your head. Relax your rectum and tighten your core in a way that sorta forces your ass open by a vacuum created by abdomen. You can then push and pull and essentially ""suck and blow"" with your asshole, it sounds gross but it's really interesting and funny.

I discovered this while in gymnastics around age 12. Our group was being led through stretches before practice, and the dude demonstrating (older guy, 20s I guess) made us lie this way to stretch. He got up to walk around and instruct people on form, then got back into position while we held the pose. After he put his legs over his head and his feet on the floor above his head, I heard a loud sucking ""SSMMMOOOOSH!"" sound come from his ass. He sorta snickered a little himself, but nobody said anything about it and quickly changed to a different pose. At first, I tried to convince myself he just beefed by accident, but I knew it didn't sound like escaping air, it was a sucking smoosh. I was fascinated enough to keep trying the same thing until one day the same thing happened to me. With practice you can control it more, and if you are thin enough you can actually create such a vacuum that you can naturally gape open like you see ppl do in pornos, but without any penetration."

I then look down at my creatine lines on the sink, proceeding to snort two lines followed by a ""WOOOOH!!!"" at the top of my lungs. I kick the bathroom door open, no tank, just myself slathered with water as I scan the room for any betas in my presence.
I puff my chest out, shoulders rotated forward, hips open to flex my quads as I walk out of the locker room like a knight in iron clad armor. I approach the bench, push any beta off the bench. That is my bench.
I proceed to look his gf in the eyes as I yell ""LIGHT WEIGHT BABY"", grab the bar that had that beta's SL5x5 weight on it, yell out another ""WOOOOOOOooooH!"" as I crank out my 20 rep warm up.

copypasta,"We made a BIG mistake in buying this card game. Knowing it was for ages 7 and up, by the makers of two favorite family games, Uno and Skip-O, we bought it for an adult family games it is recommended for ages 7 -plus. Well, this one is disappointing. First of all, reading the directions took so long with complicated moves and remembering to call out DOS reminded us of Monopoly Wars! We, as adults of better than average intelligence could not figure out when to play, what cards go on what pile and then try to remember to call DOS BEFORE you play cards to have only (DOS) two cards. Whoa! This game is too complicated and not fun to play. We decided that all the bantering over the rules was way too much so we quit after four complete games! That was too much wares time! We are a fun-loving card-playing family but this game drew out the ""swords"" as in Monopoly Wars""so much it was not fun. We are returning it to the Big ""bullseye store' for our money back. Sorry Mattel, we are not impressed with DOS, would not recommend it so we will go back to our tired but faithful games of UNO or SKIP-PO. We thoroughly enjoyed each of those games with great laughter and no bantering. Unfortunately, if you ever make a TRICE card game, we will read more reviews before buying it IF we ever buy another Mattel card game. In this, otherwise, fine series of games, DOS is a BUST!"

copypasta,"Johnny liked to fuck the corpses.

I always told him to knock it off; that one day he’d be caught by the coroner that’d be it for him. But Johnny never listened. He claimed that fucking corpses was better than fucking real life girls.

“You can do whatever you want to a corpse,” he’d reasoned. “And you don’t have to worry about pregnancy or STDs.”

When I mentioned that corpses were cold and dry, Johnny produced a curling iron from his pocket.

“Doesn’t take long to heat ‘em up with this,” he said with his trademark stupid grin. “Add a little lube and you’re good to go.”

When he was done he’d clean his semen out with a turkey baster. I thought he was a sick fucker, but he thought he was a pioneer. Different perspectives I guess.

One day we got the corpse of a Jane Doe in. Early twenties, black hair, and not a scratch on her--exactly Johnny’s type.

We kept the corpse for a while as we went through the process of identifying her, with Johnny paying her special attention every single night--sometimes even twice.

All the attempts at identification eventually went bust. The girl’s fingerprints had been burned off, her teeth filed down flat, and her DNA did not match any known database.

We couldn’t figure out the cause of death either. That gave me the creeps, but Johnny didn’t seem to mind one bit. I guess if you don’t mind fucking a corpse there isn’t much in the world that can bother you.

It was into the second week when problems began to arise for Johnny--the girl’s belly started to swell. Johnny didn’t pay much mind to it, he just flipped her over before he did his business, but I thought it was odd. Then Johnny broke his wrist and he was out for a week while he recovered in the hospital.

The girl relaxed in her drawer unmolested for the time.

When Johnny got back, however, he was in for a nasty shock. When he opened the morgue drawer and slid out his perished paramour, her belly had swelled to the point it looked like she was nine months pregnant.

“What the fuck,” said Johnny, backing up and carelessly sending a tray of scalpels clattering to the floor.

“It must be gas buildup from decomposition,” I replied, but I wasn’t sure I believed myself.

I picked one of the scalpels off the floor and held it out to Johnny.

“Go ahead,” I said.

“Go ahead and what?” he asked.

“Make an incision to let the gas out,” I replied.

A look of utter revulsion crossed Johnny’s face.

“Why do I have to do it?” he asked.

“Because if you don’t,” I said, “I’ll tell Dr. Coburn you were fucking her.”

“Some friend you are,” he replied, reluctantly taking the scalpel from me.

He leaned over and held the scalpel half an inch from her skin. He took a deep breath as he tried to steady himself, but it was no use. Tremors were creeping slowly into his hand. As soon as he touched the cold steel to her belly the corpse shot up into a sitting position and froze there, sending Johnny toppling over backwards onto the morgue floor.

“What the fuck?” he said.

“Rigor mortis,” I replied, noting that a tremor had found its way into my voice. “And bad timing.”

Johnny pushed himself back up to his feet and slowly lowered the scalpel back down, averting his eyes from the woman as the blade grew closer to her skin. The blade was just a hair away from her belly when it happened--a tiny, oily black hand erupted from her stomach, tearing her flesh apart as it burst through and seized Johnny around the wrist.

Johnny’s scream was short-lived as the arm yanked him downwards. The flesh of the woman’s belly spread apart as it pulled Johnny inside--blood spurted from the belly along with a sickly wet grinding sound as whatever it was devoured Johnny’s head.

I didn’t stay long. I turned around and sprinted out of the morgue, never stopping to look back. As I ran I heard the patter of wet feet slapping the ground behind me.

When I got far enough away I called the police from a pay phone and told them to check out the morgue. I quit my job at the coroner’s office and never looked back, but I heard through the grapevine that Johnny was never found, and neither was the corpse of the Jane Doe.

The only thing they found was little bloody footprints leading out of the morgue. When the footprints reached the outside door they vanished.

I moved out of the town in the following months and cut all contact with most of my former friends. A few years later I heard that a legend had grown in the town about a deformed creature that devoured pets and livestock whole.

Maybe it has nothing to do with what I saw that night, and maybe it does. Truth be told, I don't really want to know."

copypasta,"It's a Niggth legend. Darth Niggeus was a Dark Lord of the Niggth, so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create... white backgrounds. He had such a knowledge of the Black Side that he could even keep the teeth he cared about from disappearing. The Black Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some whiteys consider unnatural.  He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was not being on the image, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught the printer everything he knew, then his printer made him disappear on the photograph. It's ironic he could make others appear on images, but not himself."

copypasta,"Most of us know that gamers are the most oppressed minority in society today. But not everyone is aware of this. In fact, some choose to outright deny this critical fact, and claim that gamers are in fact perfectly safe and are even priveleged. I'm here to put this argument to rest.

First of all, gamers make up only about 29.2% of the world's population. This make gamers a clear minority. Additionally, the law does not grant gamers the right to vote. Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States of America states that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" Nowhere in there does it say that gamers are citizens. Citizens have the right to vote in the United States. Therefore, our basic rights are being held against us because gamers are not allowed to vote! This is an outrage!

Additionally, gamers are a struggling group. Gamers are generally unable to reproduce through traditional means due to the lack of available female gamers to mate with, and thus, the gamer population mostly grows through recruitment. Gamers are in danger of extinction, yet environmental organizations are unwilling to accept this. Gamers are not recognized by any environmental organization, and if extinction occurs, it will be kept quiet by those in power so that they do not look bad.

I'd also like to cite a few other examples of gamers being oppressed. There has never been a gamer president. Tons of gamers do streams to raise funds for other minority group, yet I have never seen a fundraiser to promote gamer health and welfare. Some countries around the world, such as China and the Philippines, have made attempts to commmit a mass genocide against gamers by exterminating their food source. 

If we do not act now, then gamers will continue to be oppressed by society, possibly even wiped out. Governments around the world refuse to acknowledge the crisis that is occurring right now. The UN has refused our pleas for help. It is time for us to help ourselves. It is time for gamers to take control and ensure that we all get the equal protection we deserve.

Gamers rise up 😎😎"

copypasta,"Last week in the boys locker room everyone was just messing around like we usually do before class starts when I hear a thud in the back.
There's some kid lying on floor, not moving.
I went back to see what had happened and apparently he was running and knocked his head hard onto one of the lockers. Soon enough everyone else started crowding around him, laughing (this kid is known for being dramatic and no one took it seriously). We were just making fun of him, when suddenly, someone starts singing the Halo theme while T-Posing. There was a  divine silence for a second, then everyone else started slowly joining in. It was beautiful. There we were, some idiot kids T-Posing and singing the Halo theme around some kid who was probably unconscious. I wanted it to last forever. This is definitely one of my best memories from school and will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Edit: I sent this to the kids who got knocked out and he's quite pleased at the fact I made him a meme."
copypasta," Why do you have to swear so much? The answer is YOU DON'T. It doesn't make you appear ""cool"" or ""edgy"", it only makes you seem like a fool. Not only that it's annoying, but it's also a sin. Heavy swears are obviously more severe but you do it so often that I'm genuinely worried about you. Please visit the church and read the Bible, swearing like a hillbilly on the Internet gets you nowhere. I think that, for now, it would be the best if you deleted your comment or at least edited the swear words."
copypasta,"Porn addicted fucks like you have shitty lives that revolve around porn sites and erectile dysfunction. Those porn sites have severs that give dumb cunts like you a page to connect to. Stay with me, fucktard. Those servers connect to the data cloud, so they can get you something for you to beat your chode to. You know what the cloud runs on? Intel. Yeah that's what I thought you dumbass. You better think twice before your you fuck with someone as smart as me. Honestly the only thing keeping you alive is Viagra and Porn, but you can't even be thankful enough for that. Pathetic."
copypasta,Homosexuality is a sin. Homosexual people suck on a large throbbing penis like a sausage and acting like wild animals hungering for the right to suck and suck and release semen into the tongue and the mouth. Their eyes turn wild and they suck and suck as well as forcing the penis down the anus and listening to it throbbing and shifting and hearing it run out of semen they cheer in their wild lust for the penis and semen for the sin of Homosexuality is a mark of Satan who tempts straight men to go wild and start acting gay. As the penis grows bigger and bigger they release it all in a burst of madness.

copypasta,"My gay sex dream
In my dream I had a few days ago, I was in New York for an unknown reason, with my brother and my dad. I was walking down times square, when I happened upon a strange building that everyone called the house of the rising sun. It was made of shitty plywood, and the fact that it was still standing defied all logic. Anyways, at some point I had somehow picked up an unhatched baby chicken, that was in a placenta bag thingy instead of an egg. *Sooooooooo* I was walking up the staircase that was falling apart as I ascended the building. At the end of the staircase, there was a room with some guys playing pool. I asked what’s up, and they told me to enjoy the end of the world. This was when I remembered that thanos had snapped away 95% of the population for some reason. After that, the walls started to fold into each other, revealing a flo commercial. On the set, there was nathan barratt, who had his dick stuck in a fence, which I leaned down and helped to get unstuck. That’s when everyone noticed his **MASSIVE RAGING BONER!** He asked if I have ever had sex before, and I sheepishly told him that I’m a virgin. That’s when all the others on set started to cheer us on, forcing me to suck his **FUCKING HUGE SLIMY VEINY PENIS**, like a good little altar boy whore for millions to see on live television; because after all, it was the end of the world! I pulled off my skinny jeans and forced Nathan down onto his knees. I put my **GIANT CUM COVERED FUCK MACHINE COCK** into his wet mouth, and started to vigorously fuck it like a jar of grape jelly. In seconds I came all over his beautiful face, causing an uproar of approval from the horny crowd of gay jack offs all around me. That’s when it happed. To my right I could hear the clickety clack from a sexy, hot, fuck toy of a woman’s high heals approaching me. I turn towards her, to be awarded with the sight of the beautiful Zooey Deschanel. She looks at me with the the absolute hottest of smiles, and asked if the thick juicy ropes of milky white semen that was covering barretts face, my **THROBING COCK**, and my entire lower body, dripping onto the floor in big wet steamy piles of delicious holy fuck nut, was cum. Instantly I told her in a jovial tone that it was precum! She stared at us adorably, contemplating if she wanted to cuck, fuck, or suck me. Realizing this, I casually ask her if she would like to hop in. All she does is stare into my soul. Frustrated, I force Nathan onto his thick juicy ass, laying him down onto his back like a submissive dog. I started to savagely fuck him in his ass, looking at his ripped abs, and suddenly came 5 times in his ass, on his chest, and all over the crowd. I look over at zooey, who look back in silent approval, with big, thick, globs of my nut dripping down off of  her face, out of her pretty hair (that’s perfect for fucking) and onto the floor. With a drop of cum on her left eyebrow, and a pretty smile across her yummy face, she turned away and walked into the sunset. I loved to watch her ass move as she walked away. Her pure hotness made me cum even more, into my partners urethral orifice (which I had to managed to fit my male sexual organ into), causing his **THICK, RUBBRY, PULSATING DICK** to explode. Then I woke up, and found that I pissed my bed. Goddamn it! I just washed my sheets yesterday, and now I have to do it again. I need to stop drinking lemonade before bed! Btw even though we didn’t say no homo it was implied, which mean that I’m not gay; because after all it was the end of the world and I really wanted to stick my **FLESHY DILDO DICK** into zooey.

She got up 3-4 times a night to make herself snacks and made a fucking bunch of stupid noise. I don't know if she was diabetic or what the reason was for her constantly getting up to eat in the middle of the night, but if I stayed in there for one more month I would have fucking stabbed her in her useless fucking old bitch heart. fuck that old, degenerate, decrepit woman. she's going to die alone for good reason. in fact, i hope she literally dies tonight. wherever you are, Helen, I hope you fucking die tonight for giving me months of hell and obliterating my sleep schedule. i hope that as your heart stops beating, your brain doesn't give you any feelings of bliss that accompanies death - i hope it comes as a dark abyss in your mind, as your useless brain stops functioning, no light, no bliss, nothing. you just die, realizing how useless of a fucking existence you've lead. fuck you and your dumb fucking ass. i'm still trying to get my sleep back on track from constantly waking up multiple times a night for months because of you and your lack of consideration for anyone but yourself. fucking dumb cunt deserves to get anally gaped by satans barbed cock for the rest of her afterlife."

copypasta,"So recently I put my dick in the barrel of a nerf gun. Why you ask? Well it seemed that it would fit perfectly in the barrel and when I shot it on slam fire it would feel good. IT DID NOT FEEL GOOD. It went to fast and put a temporary dent on the head. Then it started bleeding and got stuck in the barrel. I finally managed to pull it out but there was a big burn mark on one side and there was blood everywhere because the insides got cut when I pulled it out.

Moral: cross nerf gun barrel off of your to do list."

copypasta," Where can I start...what they say is 100% RIGHT...once you go black you DON'T go back!

Lafonda and Daequinisha sucked my big fat (5.5x7"") white cock to completion...3 times!

Then they rubbed their big black booties on my face and rode me until my balls felt like bursting!

Then I turned them around and pulled their weaves until I was about to explode again!

Lafonda's weave came out and goddamn...that was one nappy headed hoe.

After that, I tasted that...black tart...that black cherry everyone talks about and...holy fuck! Daequinisha's cock was so fucking round and hard  it made a visible thud when she pulled it out and slapped across my face! Lafonda's testicles drooped down the floor!

I was sucking their cocks like a black man sucks on a chicken bone after church on Sunday! Holy moly fogoly!"
copypasta,"Last week in the boy's locker room everyone was just messing around like we usually do before class starts when I hear a thud in the back. There’s some kid lying on the floor, not moving. I went to the back to see what had happened and apparently he was running and knocked his head hard into one of the lockers. Soon enough everyone else started crowding around him, laughing (this kid is known for being dramatic so no one took it seriously). We were just making fun of him, when suddenly, someone starts singing the Halo theme while t-posing. There was a divine silence for a second, then everyone else started slowly joining in. It was beautiful. There we were, some idiot kids t-posing and singing the halo theme around some kid who was probably unconscious. I wanted it to last forever. This is definitely one of my best memories from school and will stay with me for the rest of my life."

copypasta,"Gravitational mass is identical to inertial mass. That is, the amount of inertia something has and the amount of gravity it has are effectively the same. What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any reason this should be true. One could imagine a really large object with lots of resistance to force, and no gravity (or vice versa), but this is never observed. 

You know what ? I'm just gonna skip the rest of the buildup and say it. Yo mama's Fat.

copypasta,"old people are so fucking inconsiderate. i had to unfortunately roommate with a 66 year old woman for a couple months. god fucking dammit, worst months of my life. she was a disgusting fucking slob, made the kitchen a fucking mess always, didn't give one fuck if she made a bunch of noise at 3AM - which she actually did constantly. sink was always full of dishes - made the apartment stink like shit. i would open the fucking windows and she would up and close them. She got up 3-4 times a night to make herself snacks and made a fucking bunch of stupid noise. I don't know if she was diabetic or what the reason was for her constantly getting up to eat in the middle of the night, but if I stayed in there for one more month I would have fucking stabbed her in her useless fucking old bitch heart. fuck that old, degenerate, decrepit woman. she's going to die alone for good reason. in fact, i hope she literally dies tonight. wherever you are, Helen, I hope you fucking die tonight for giving me months of hell and obliterating my sleep schedule. i hope that as your heart stops beating, your brain doesn't give you any feelings of bliss that accompanies death - i hope it comes as a dark abyss in your mind, as your useless brain stops functioning, no light, no bliss, nothing. you just die, realizing how useless of a fucking existence you've lead. fuck you and your dumb fucking ass. i'm still trying to get my sleep back on track from constantly waking up multiple times a night for months because of you and your lack of consideration for anyone but yourself. fucking dumb cunt deserves to get anally gaped by satans barbed cock for the rest of her afterlife."
copypasta,"I went to AutoZone with my sister to change her car battery. After I picked out the one I wanted the clerk, a tiny female struggled to carry it so I grabbed the battery put it on the counter and paid for it. I also had to leave my license because I borrowed a wrench to install it in their parking lot. I had on a t shirt, I'm slim but kinda jacked thanks to this sub for my 30 pound gains! Upon returning to the counter to retrieve my license, there was a gentleman really struggling to open this bottle of fluid to the point of returning it as he deemed it defective. Using all his night with no success, he hands the bottle to the same clerk that I helped carry my battery. She me approaching, and in turn hands me the bottle. I literally open it with two fingers! No problem, i and gave it to the gentleman. At the same time they both say ""wow"" ! He thanks me and she was staring with the dreamy eyes like I'm a super hero. I politely take my license and start to head out. Meanwhile a small line had formed behind the man with the bottle. As I walked by, everyone was staring. My sister was by the exit and seeing what happened said ""I guess all that time at the gym is really paying off"". I kinda shrugged my shoulders like ""it's nothing"". Here's the kicker, If only they knew...when I saw the man struggling with the bottle my first thought was that it might be a safety cap and I was looking. By the time the clerk started handing it to me my eyes already spotted a smoothed out section on the cap among the ridges. Logically assumed there was another smooth side on the opposite end, therefore I literally had to use two fingers to squeeze and twist the cap. It looked super impressive, and like I was showing off a bit , but I wasn't. In fact it didn't even occur to me the reaction I'd get or that everyone would assume I was so strong. But I just let the moment ride. I did make size and strength gains in my own right without these strangers knowing my journey. More importantly, I made psychological gains. I also attribute clearer and sharper thinking to lifting weights and a healthier lifestyle. Maybe weightlifting might not increase one's IQ, but I have to believe it helps in that capacity somehow. All this to say, as we reflect with pride on our new found physical gains, lets not forget to be proud of and flex our brain gains as well."
copypasta,"Ive fucking had it with you filthy degenerates who believe it is acceptable to draw puss coloured cock and balls on a fucking Minion of all things. Joke or not it is not “art” its the fucking reason the idea of sin exists, and dont say “I have freedom over what sick fucking shit I decide to spew out of a pencil because I think that Minions are fucking sexy and deserve to be lewded and drawn into at least 17 different scenarios involving Cock and Ball torture” no in this case fuck your free speech, if limiting free speech means that this subhuman filth is no longer made then call me fucking mute. Also Minions cannot ”yes” or ”no” all they can say is “banana” and various racial slurs in their native tongue which means YOU ARE DRAWING A MINION DESTROYING ITS FUCKING BALLS WITH A HOMEMADE SHOTGUN WITHOUT CONSENT.

copypasta,"So recently I put my dick in the barrel of a nerf
gun. Why you ask? Well it seemed that it would fit
perfectly in the barrel and when I shot it on slam
fire it would feel good. IT DID NOT FEEL GOOD.
It went so fast and put a temporary dent on the
head. Then it started bleeding and got stuck in
the barrel. I finally managed to pull it out but
there was a big burn mark on one side and there
was blood everywhere because the insides got cut when I pulled it out.

Moral: cross nerf gun barrel off of your to do list."
copypasta,"Before I start: You know, I grew up in a small village near Moscow, I didn't came in contact with English much in my childhood, the Soviet Union was still big and strong you know, well they elected Gorbatschow, so we could have seen it coming tbh, dammit Gorbatschow. So where was I... When the Iron Curtain fell, we moved to Jamaica (my mom is from Cuba and likes the caribbean flair, actually they brought alot of comrades over from Cuba, many people do not know this haha) therefore I learned only Creole English, when I moved to the US in '99, (to Gary, Indiana to be precise), I came in contact with real english. Haha funny thing, the people in my neighbourhood were very confused to see a small gobnik, pale white speaking a weird Creole English mixed with Russian, but I adopted quite the african american slang when I joined a gang (haha to the [r/thathappened](https://www.reddit.com/r/thathappened) writers... [r/nothingeverhappens](https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens) am i rite lol). Yeah after jail I studied physics (like my cuban mom) and my professors always told me that they can't believe that I write quite well, but speak to weird (people think I fake this, but I don't haha). So yeah, although the profs said I write like a native, English isn't my first language."

copypasta,"My name is Zak Bagans, I never believed in ghosts until I came face to face with one . So I set out on a quest to capture what I once saw on to video. With no big camera crews following us around, I'm joined only by my fellow investigator Nick Groff and our equipment tech Aron Goodwin. The three of us will travel to some of the most highly active paranormal locations, where will spend an entire night being locked down from dusk until dawn. Raw, extreme, these are our Ghost adventures."

 Nani the fuck did omae just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of watashino class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the ichiban letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nanimonai to watashi but just another weeaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has itsumonai been mimasu’d before on kono continent, mark watashino fucking kotobas. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker.

copypasta,So recently I put my dick in the barrel of a nerf gun. Why you ask? Well it seemed that it would fit perfectly in the barrel and when I shot it on slam fire it would feel good. IT DID NOT FEEL GOOD. It went to fast and put a temporary dent on the head. Then it started bleeding and got stuck in the barrel. I finally managed to pull it out but there was a big burn mark on one side and there was blood everywhere because the insides got cut when I pulled it out.
copypasta,So My Dicc🍆 is long➡️ and ready👍 to stick in a womans👩 ass🍑. oooh feels soo good ☺️
copypasta,"Seriously, someone makes a post about some random crap here, then someone in the comment section of their post literally COPY and pastes the same thing as said in the post, and comments it, and gets SO MANY upvotes. Or, a commenter changes it with a few letter w's, making their sentences appear to be coming from a little child who can't speak. I guarantee you 100% someone on this subreddit will see this post, and then copy and paste it into the comment section. Haha ha, so funny! How original, to copy what someone said in a post and then paste it into the comment section. That's real humor there, you're a real comedian. (or some mod will remove this post for USELESS BS)"

bit of context:  The name of the island they found me on is Lian-Yu. It's Mandarin for ""Purgatory."" I've been ""stranded"" here for 5-years. I've dreamt of my rescue every cold black night since then. For 5 years, I have had only one thought, one goal... survive... Survive and one day return home. The island held many dangers. To live, I had to make myself more than what I was, to forge myself into a weapon. I am returning not the boy who was shipwrecked but the man who will bring justice to those who have poisoned my city. My name is Oliver Queen

copypasta,One of my most favorite things in the world is grilled corn on the cob. this morning my mom told me she bought some so I said ok can you save me a few so I can grill them later and she said yes. I was excited all day looking forward to this. So whatever I get home and take a nap then go to the gym and all I could think of was grilling two corn on the cobs and enjoying the shit out of them. I get home but before I could turn the grill on I could hear a loud hiss and my worst fear came true. My fucking mom didn’t close the valve for the propane. So I go to light up the grill and the flame was so fucking tiny that the grill didn’t go past 300°F. I had two corn on the cobs on the grill for ONE HOUR and then I finally gave up and decided to eat them. HALF. COOKED. half cooked. And all I wanted today was corn on the cob. I’m literally pissed. half of the kernels were hard and the other were nice and soft and grilled. Like wtf. I  just wanted my fucking corn on the cob.

It was years ago and it was our middle child, a girl with baby blue eyes and long, blonde hair. She was probably about four at the time and we lived in a brick ranch. She shared a bedroom with her sister, which happened to be right next to ours.

It was a weekend night, well after midnight. We were both a little drunk. Probably a bit buzzed up, too, as we forgot to lock the bedroom door.

We’d been playing for awhile and my Hubby was hitting it from behind, his hands on my hips, fingers curling into my flesh, his thighs slapping against my ass.

Me… My head was buried in the pillow, trying to drown out the sounds of my pleasure.

He was fucking me hard. So hard, there’s a good chance the headboard was banging against the wall. And I was not paying a bit of attention, lost in the throes of orgasm.

And then there it was.

A quiet voice, full of sleep and confusion.

*Daddy, what are you doing to Mommy’s butt?*

He practically threw me to the other side of the bed, spinning around to face the little blonde girl in the white nightgown.

Panting, he asked, *“What?”*

She repeated herself. *What were you doing to Mommy’s butt?*

I looked at him. I looked at her. Tension hung in the air.

Instead of waiting for him to think up some random answer, I grabbed the sheet to my breast, swung my legs off the side of the bed, and stood up. I grabbed her hand and in my best mommy voice said, “Let me take you back to bed, baby. You’re just having a funny dream.”

I’m grateful she’s never mentioned it!"

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hitman: Contracts. The plot is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Hitman lore most of the story will go over a typical player’s head. There’s also the bleak atmosphere, which is deftly woven into the levels - the mission The Seafood Massacre draws heavily from the Blade Runner movies, for instance. The roleplayers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the vibe, to realize that it’s not just edgy- it’s something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Hitman: Contracts truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the meaning in 47’s existencial catchphrase “I need to use the bathroom,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Mario Puzo’s Godfather. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated speedrunners scratching their heads in confusion as Jesper Kyd’s genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools… how I pity them 😂. And yes by the way, I DO have a Fleur De Lis tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they’re within 50 hours played of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

copypasta,"Okay so I'm sitting in my room right? And my poodle is sitting in the corner of the room, and I'm looking at him and I just think ""damn, does she have a nice ass"". Like I'm not a furry and I will never, EVER be one, but honestly, I really wanna go deep into that cute ass. I can only imagine how tight and narrow and just absolute euphoric the feeling must be. Just the thought of her yelping while I drill my corn cob dick into her rear make me tingle with excitement! I'm also curious as to what her anal region tastes like. The pure temptation that the feeling of tongue-punching her right in the butthole is like is plain unfathomable. And as I am eating out her ass she might fart or even shit onto my face and into my mouth! Oh-ho, what a pleasant mess that would be! One can only dream however, I can only take a few beatings from my dad a day, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold in the feelings I have for my mutt's monster masscheeks, which enclose her adorable little anus like the Gates of Heaven! Call it a gift from God because it can't be anything less!"
copypasta,"For all those who don't understand the song, here is a summary: In the prelude, Dr. Dre discusses a musical piece composed by Eazy E and recalls that some of their mutual acquaintances initially questioned its artistic viability. He requests that Eazy E perform the piece; he does so, and this comprises the remainder of the track. In the main body of the track, the narrator awakens around 12 noon and feels a compulsion to travel shortly to the nearby city of Compton. He asserts a need to become intoxicated from alcohol before his day's activities begin in earnest, and before his mother renews an apparently regular practice of complaining about his social acquaintances. As he departs, several young people nearby indicate with hand signals their affiliation with a gang other than the narrator's. To encourage these potential adversaries to withdraw these gestures (and, indeed, the pretense they imply), the narrator retrieves a MAC-10 firearm and an ammunition clip from inside his home, returns outside, and demonstratively aims the weapon at the perceived offenders. As he anticipates, however, the young people continue their symbolic affront. The narrator then enters his vehicle (later revealed to be a 1964 Chevrolet Impala) and accelerates; he also assures the listener that his vehicle's hydraulic system is especially well-articulated. He powers on his Alpine-brand stereo system, and plays the N.W.A song ""Gangsta Gangsta"". (The narrator describes the song as new; indeed, ""Gangsta Gangsta"" was first released the year after ""Boyz-n-the-Hood."") Employing the technique of mise en abyme, the narrator plays on his stereo one of his own compositions and (approximately) recalls its lyrics: In the song, he operates the aforementioned vehicle, engages in sexual intercourse with and commits domestic abuse against multiple women, visits a park to learn from associates about recent occurrences, and observes people playing basketball there. An unknown person drives a Chevrolet El Camino to near the narrator, then, rolling down the window, reveals himself to be fellow rap artist Matthew Garfield, identified here as Kilo G. Kilo G explains that he stole the vehicle and moreover explicitly endorses that method of vehicle acquisition. Leaving the recollection of the song-within-a-song, the narrator proceeds to the chorus, passing temporarily from narrative to cautionary meditations about the men who live in his neighborhood: They are well-attuned to threats of coercive force and can themselves competently exercise force as circumstances dictate. Moreever, they respond to their criticism by evaluating their detractors' boasts and even threats of violence, and then effectively rescinding their ability to do so. He states, too, that said men are motivated foremost, or even exclusively, by authenticity, but asks the listener not to attribute these assertions to him, insisting (rhetorically) that he has avowed nothing. Returning to specific descriptions of the day's events, the narrator travels to the residence of a man whom he identifies as B, to learn again whether anything significant has occurred recently. When he arrives, B informs him that a common (and present) acquaintance, J.D., is freebasing. Shortly, the narrator discovers J.D. attempting to purloin the previously mentioned stereo system in the narrator's car. He pursues J.D., ostensibly intending to resolve the conflict peacefully, but J.D. brandishes a gun that uses .22 caliber ammunition, apparently unaware that the narrator himself is carrying a 12-gauge shotgun. In the ensuing duel, the narrator kills J.D. but himself survives. The conflict is later described on the front page of the Los Angeles Times, a local newspaper. The apparently jaded narrator then expresses his boredom and (again) a desire to consume alcohol, and drives to a location where his close associates often convene for subdued social interaction; those associates, too, earn an income outside their homes. Upon his arrival, some of those associates there offer him a 40-oz. container of Olde English 800 malt liquor, which he accepts and begins to consume, stating that it causes his breath to gain an unpleasant odor. He follows the malt with a Bacardi-brand spirit, then departs for his significant other's residence with the intention of engaging in sexual intercourse with her. While there, she states something that displeases him and moreover confounds his expectations of her. In response, he grabs her by the hair; she protests further, and he strikes her, comparing the rebuke to one a pimp may physically inflict on a prostitute. The woman's father, whom the narrator describes as aged, and who is present for this conflict, stands and objects emphatically to the narrator's conduct. The narrator responds by striking him, too, leaving him unconscious. The narrator drives home, believing despite his alcohol consumption that he maintains his physical wherewithal, but shortly crashes his vehicle into a telephone pole. Unfazed, he plans to abandon it and purchase a replacement, and travels homeward on foot. En route, he sees Kilo G and a companion in a car that makes an apparently illegal U-turn: They are subsequently pulled over in a traffic stop conducted by an undercover police officer who was driving a green Chevrolet Nova. Kilo G's companion resists arrest and sustains blows in the effort; during the confrontation, the companion's Guess-brand garment is torn, and in retribution he strikes the officer in the head. The incident involves Kilo G's fourth criminal offense, leading the narrator to surmise (correctly, it is soon revealed) that Kilo G will be imprisoned. Later, the narrator travels to free his associates but cannot: They have been remanded without bail, for instigating a riot in the county prison. Two days later, during municipal court proceedings, Kilo G audibly expels intenstinal gas through his anus, and the judge finds him guilty of obstruction of justice; he remains stoic when the judge announces his sentence of six years. As the bailiff approaches him, he smiles, and yells, ""fire,"" signaling a woman, Suzi, who enters the courtroom with an Uzi submachine gun. Police shoot but do not critically injure her; later, both she and Kilo G are imprisoned for attempted murder."

copypasta,"This may sound a bit weird and creepy, but I think it would actually be kinda cool to find a fallen, vaguely humanoid, pale skinned demon staring at me through the window pane in the middle of the night.    
    
I would quietly show it into my dimly lit parlour and drop my robe, revealing my firm, tender flesh, and my wet young cunt.   
     
I dance for the demonic being, running my finger down it's slime covered chest until I reach it's throbbing cock buried within it's hairy crotch. The demon screams.    
    
In one swift motion, I have the hell-spawn on the floor, and mount it's large mephistophelic phallus. I am moaning in pleasure as the hard, hooved, demon cock fills my dripping loins.    
    
My demonic lover howls in pleasure, ripping open my abdomen with its sharp bony fingers as it cums.    
    
I am shivering in pain and excitement as the monster begins to gnaw upon my spilling viscera, and soon, I join it in the consumption of my own guts, savouring the raw post-orgasmic meal even as I rapidly fade into death, induced by the consumption of my ruptured vitals. So fucking hot lol"

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish ourselves doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed in frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

copypasta,"The Emoji Movie. A masterpiece. Hayao Miyazaki is crying on a corner, Disney is negotiating with Sony to see if they can buy the rights, but Sony still refuses. 
You know Andy Warhol? He made some movies. At one point, he said ""I want to push the boundaries of cinema and make an interesting, convoluted movie about walking, yellow faces that embody human emotions. This will explore the human psyche and make strong statements and critiques about our society."" Sony picked the concept, and absolutely nailed it. 
This theatrical feature tells the story about Gene, an emoji that can alter his expressions at will, reflecting the diversity of the human mind. He lives in a monotonous, authoritarian society, ruled by a ruthless dictator called ""Smiley"". Film critics can see some similarities between this and George Orwell's ""1984"", which is considered a timeless classic that has relevance even today.
But I'd like to differ, as the Emoji Movie absolutely Trump's the book, with its intricate characters, such as ""Poop"",a caring dad who goes through a transformation in a beautiful character arc. 
Saying it briefly, the Emoji Movie cured my daughter's depression and my AIDS. I recommend it profusely."
copypasta,"You know what? I'm fucking done with you. You keep fucking talking about, ""how great Alladin is"" WELL IT'S NOT. CARPETS CAN'T FUCKING FLY, IF THEY COULD FLY THEN YOUR MOM WOULD BE IN A FUCKING SPACESHIP. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU FUCKING LIKE ALLADIN IT'S SO UNREALISTIC! Oh, what's that? You say you don't think carpets can fly, but you just like the movie? Well bad news for you buckaroo, if you support the movie, you're supporting the fAKE NEWS OF THE RADICAL LEFT, THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE ANYTHING AND SUPPORTING THAT MOVIE IS SUPPORTING PEOPLE THINKING THAT CARPETS CAN FLY.

copypasta,"Wrestling is tough, wrestling is painful but the rewards are unforgettable. When I first started wrestling I remember I was this scronny kid with no plan of what I wanted to do. When I first met wrestling I never though I would be where I am today and how much I still have to accomplish. When I first started I hated wrestling and wanted to quit, but as the hard work started paying and I started to realize more what wrestling meant to me I fell in love with this sport. My blood, sweat and tears I shed everyday started paying off in life and on the mat. On the mat I got better and better each day but not only on the mat I was nothing I wasn’t so skinny anymore and I actually had definition to me. My ninth grade year of high school I never though I would be in the position of a varsity spot my first year!! After my freshman year went by Ann it didn’t go to well😂. I realized I need to get to work NOW because EVERYDAY MATTERS and I started grinding again. As the next year came around I can’t even explain to you how eager I was to get back into that mat. Even though my sophomore year I fell short of my goal of a state placer I was runner up at sectionals. Than districts came around and I knew i was the best I could beat these seniors and that’s exactly what I did. I beat TWO seniors in close matches that required heart and dedication, I than found myself in the DISTRICT finals against one of the best in the state and lost but it wasn’t anything to sleep on. Than at regionals I went 1-2 but was proud of myself and I realized than I know I can do it. Since than I’ve been going everyday and doing all I can for next year. Since the season ended I got to work and drill with some of the best in the country and world. Next season I’ll be readier than ever and ILL BE COMING FOR THAT STATE TITLE. Thank you wrestling for all the hard work I’ve put in and the accomplishments that came out of that🙏🙏🥰"
copypasta,"This may sound a bit weird and creepy, but I think it would actually be kinda cool to find a fallen, vaguely humanoid, pale skinned demon staring at me through the window pane in the middle of the night.

I would quietly show it into my dimly lit parlour and drop my robe, revealing my firm, tender flesh, and my wet young cunt.

I dance for the demonic being, running my finger down it's slime covered chest until I reach it's throbbing cock buried within it's hairy crotch. The demon screams.

In one swift motion, I have the hell-spawn on the floor, and mount it's large mephistophelic phallus. I am moaning in pleasure as the hard, hooved, demon cock fills my dripping loins.

My demonic lover howls in pleasure, ripping open my abdomen with its sharp bony fingers as it cums.

I am shivering in pain and excitement as the monster begins to gnaw upon my spilling viscera, and soon, I join it in the consumption of my own guts, savouring the raw post-orgasmic meal even as I rapidly fade into death, induced by the consumption of my ruptured vitals. So fucking hot lol"

copypasta,"Not Wilford Brimley.

I'm a federal agent in the ATF. Our team was breaking up an illegal cockfighting ring in Oregon. Brimley was in the room when we breached the door, stroking his prize cock. He bellows like a fucking walrus, mainlines 400cc of insuline like Bane Beetus, and takes a sumo stance. He drove a 260 pound agent-a former college linebacker-through a concrete pillar. Broke that man's spine and ended his career. I'll never forget the sound. I scream CALL LIBERTY to ops because we need backup. In less than a second, Brimley yanks an ancient-looking double barreled 12-guage shotgun, and a fucking MONSTER sword, like a 2-handed flamberge. He's soaking up .45 APC rounds like they're fucking glycotabs. We're trying to fight to a retreat and he starts bellowing in Sumerian, and the weather suddenly gets REALLY vicious, as in driving, chill rain and sharp lightning. It was almost pitch black out as I scrambled back to the tactical vehicle. There's a HUGE lightning flash and the last thing I see before the artillery strike was Brimley spinning like Palpatine and hollering, carving his way through my team like an insulin needle through a moist, flabby arm.
It was almost a direct hit. Nothing human could have survived. And yet he was at the foot of my hospital bed at 3 AM just as the blackout hit first the main power, and then the generac. The only light was the glow of his huge cigar. He looked demonic. I was in traction. He slowly ground his cigar out on my big toe. The light died for what seemed like forever. When the power clicked back on, there was a writ of pardon for Mr. Brimley from the governor, as well as a summons. Brimley was suing the agency. The cockfighting was a religious ritual, sacred to Odinists.

copypasta,"I'll give it my best shot. The world needs more queefers. Before trying to queef, make sure your equipment is soft and flexible. When you get more experience queefing it won't be necessary, but try to get warm and aroused when you start teaching yourself.

Spread your legs to allow your flaps to spread so they can let air in. Then suck in your stomach and try to suck upward, which will pull air in when you learn to pull your muscles the right way. The air-sucking is the hardest step, but once you have it you should be able to replicate it. When you feel the air rush in, close your legs to trap it then squeeze it out. This step can eventually be eliminated, as with practice I eventually learned to queef without moving my legs at all.

I'm sorry if this is tough to absorb, because it's difficult to teach. It's almost like learning to whistle or wiggle your ears because you need to experiment with your muscles to learn it. The first queef will most likely be harder than every subsequent queef you make in your like combined."

He won't bring in new players to Smash Bros. He's not significant in the slightest, except for his exceptionally loud fanbase with a massive victim complex. Look at ALL the third party characters we have. Do you not see what they have that Banjo doesn't? They are all a mixture of being iconic, relevant, well known, or helping Smash tap into new fanbases. Banjo-Kazooie were relevant for a couple of years. They were never on the same level as other characters at the time such as Lara Croft or Crash. Shit.

As a previous Scientometrics researcher (2 single author publications), in my opinion, Times Higher Education's methodology is more consistent, rigorous, and accurate at estimating key institution metrics, thus providing a far superior alternative in terms of quality of ranking, accuracy, and no garbage factored in with incomplete data sets that you get with US News. For scientific research only, the ARWU (Shanghai Ranking) is comparable to the Times Higher Education Ranking. Both Times Higher Education Ranking and the ARWU methodologies, along with sources of data, are far superior to that of US News.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You have to look at source of the information that you are getting.

Times Higher Education is published by the Wall Street Journal, a highly reputable newspaper, and historically has been one of the most excellent sources of news with the most talented writers, along with the most knowledgeable experts in their corresponding fields. Look at how many famous successful journalists work for them. The Wall Street Journal is also one of the world's largest circulated weekly news source and features a variety of top-notch content.

US News, beside their ""ranking,"" is a garbage little newspaper company, and only sounds prestigious due to their name. Nearly no famous/influential people work for them. They have a terrible track record and are truly a laughingstock if you investigate the state of the company. Since they do not release their data to the public, their rankings may just be a pure fraud, as the results that they get do not agree well with reference standard rankings that are calculated using legitimate methodology.

According to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report

""Prior to GOING DEFUNCT, U.S. News was the LOWEST-RANKING news magazine in the U.S., after Time and Newsweek.[13] A weekly digital magazine, U.S. News Weekly, introduced in January 2009,[14] continued to offer subscription content until it CEASED at the end of April 2015.[15]""

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
However, people who use the US News ranking are really not thinking about what they are looking at. It is almost as if somehow a predatory low quality journal (such as ""American Journal"" of whatever on this list: https://predatoryjournals.com/journals/), that will publish nearly anything, managed to trick the general population into believing that they are better than Nature or Science.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Down with US News. If all the Asian people along with our friends band together, and actively promote the use of the more accurate, reliable, non-partisan, non-discriminatory, race-blind, and overall superior Times Higher Education Ranking, we can boycott US News out of business.

Please share this message. People are power. We can stop US News. We can stop racist rankings. We can stop institutionalized discrimination. We can stop the College Board.

Thank you all,

With much gratitude,
Your friend,

John T. Li"

copypasta," Dude tonight is so annoying my bro got really drunk with friends for his birthday. They came here belligerent, one passed out on the couch early, my brother tried to run away and I chased him, everyone was emotional tellin their feelings and shit. my bro passed out up stairs and left me with our friend who started goin crazy to the others and said he might kill them, they stepped out for a bit, were gonna leave n take an Uber home, but came back  kept makin hella noise. Left to catch an Uber again came back again, made more noise and crashed on the couch in the garage together doin some beast with two backs Shakespeare shit, so I dipped upstairs. Left me with the other guy who is severely intoxicated we were talkin a lot about death, well more him than me, but he went to the bathroom and he took hella long time so I checked on him because he’s shit on our bathroom rug twice before when drinking . I heard him snoring in the bathroom so I checked if it was unlocked it was so I peeped he fell asleep on the toilet naked, don't even know why he took off his clothes. I close the door and think what I have to do: he’s asleep so that's nice, but if I leave him I have to wait till someone gives him a ride in the morning so I say no I have to wake him. I go in there to wake him softly so he doesn’t panic, making sure not to look at his penis but it's too late and now I am self-conscious about mine, and he wakes slowly like an ape in the morning grunting and shit so I slowly step back and close the door behind me so he can hopefully put his pants on in one piece. I hear a crash and I open up again to see him on the floor still naked and with shit knocked over. I try and help him, but he's like stuck in the corner of the bathtub upside down, his rock hard cock on the edge preventing him from getting up.  Tried to pull him up but he’s so fucked and resisting, screaming about stopping the yak slave trade and shit. Fuck tonight was tough I can’t sleep cause I got a naked guy in my bathroom who could possibly shit on the floor."

copypasta,"The Chad Colby6736 DESTROYS the LEFTIST EURO-SOCIALIST TDS VICTIM COMPLEX with FACTS and LOGIC!

But in all seriousness, when people say stuff like the above and ""orange man bad,"" they're usually not some Steven Anderson/Jack Hyles Independent Fundamental Baptist Neo-Nazi cult supporter. They're doing it in jest. A lot of people voted for Trump in the '16 election because he was viewed as the lesser of two evils: one was the wife of a serial adulterer who was awfully protective of her e-mails when, if she was honest, she'd have shared them immediately without any drama. Not to mention, her very anti-Gamergate-esque approach that, in the aftermath of 2014/2015, wasn't exactly a good idea considering how 4chan was and still is.

Some people also voted for Trump because he was promising things people were wanting: more control of the money THAT THEY EARN FROM WORKING THEMSELVES, a wall to keep people who, don't get me wrong, some may be innocently wanting the better opportunities that America provides. No one is saying that they don't understand why they want over. Mexico has a lot of its OWN problems that they're going to, as a nation run by INDIVIDUALS with FREE WILL, have to overthrow their corrupt government in a rebellion that's going to have to be led by an individual of strong moral character and integrity. Yes, George Washington owned slaves, something that was common among people in those days. No, that's not an excuse, and fuck off with the dogwhistle accusation. You know who you are, and you're only looking to limit everyone's freedom of speech, whether you realize it or not, you're a drone paid to post things you know aren't true. George Washington had the same flaws as any individual did: David had more than 2 wives, one of which he got after murdering one of his soldiers who was innocent, a result that also got others killed. Moses got angry at God, and couldn't enter the Israel, which is a good nation TODAY, BTW! The people who hate the Israelites and the Jews up against the vile Jihadists in the Middle East who are among the largest offenders to the rights of women and gays around the world in ways that MOST, not all mind you (again, mostly Quiverfull-types like the IFB in my experience, though more conservative Catholics, Lutherans, and other Evangelicals apply), but MOST Christians aren't are the same naive, mentally malleable, dream chasing idiots who followed Hitler to the concentration camps, Lenin and Stalin to the gulags, and Mao to Christian persecution. Does that excuse any criticism of Christianity? No! They have no idea the gravity of what it is they're supporting because they drank the kool-aid of the conservative culture that Trump sucks up to in public when his personal life is anything but conservative IN SPITE of his lowering of income taxes, relaxation of overregulation, and his success in dealing with ISIS MUCH more swiftly than Obama did. Shockingly, someone can be conservative (""true"" conservative isn't something I care to argue about, quite honestly), criticize things that conservatives hold dear. I know, everything's not black and white. As if that's an excuse for the buffoonery I see in these comments sometimes.

Steven Anderson is creating a cult that branched off the one that Jack Hyles started and popularized in the 70's and onward. Hyles said, did, and supported many things that Anderson has excused and still propagates in his preaching in spite of the evidence with Hyles' SIL Jack Schaap and his scandal with the minor that Hyles definitely would've been involved in if he were still alive. Unfortunately, people are supporting the conspiracy theory believer (Holocaust denial included), and his New Independent Fundamental Baptist cult (Hyles and Schaap and their many, many offshoots are Old Independent Fundamental Baptist) is getting larger with more churches and pastors every day (some of these pastors being older children and teenagers as well), with a lot of the same values that characterized the old (think the lifestyle of the Duggars, though not necessarily that many kids) outside of them being unsupportive of OIFB colleges like Bob Jones University, Pensacola Christian College, West Coast Baptist, Hyles-Anderson, Maranatha Baptist, etc.. A lot of the ACTUAL or VERY CLOSE alt-right base, I can guarantee you, is coming out of these cultures, as the church my parents go to's pastor once spent time with Mike Huckabee himself at an event, or so he claimed in front of the entire audience. The organization, a reform home for addicts, admitted Josh Duggar in late 2015, and tried to avoid paparazzi by denying that he was there. A representative from this organization did speak at an event when Ted Cruz was running for the Republican primary in 2016.

If there's no connection there, you tell me what that is!"
copypasta,"Tonight I learned that not all razors are created equal. For years I had been shaving my balls with a bog standard disposable single blade razor, with a tiny strip of moisturiser. In hindsight, every occasion was nerve jangling pubic surgery, one wrong move and I'd end up with a fleshy totem pole of blood and toilet paper, that is until today. 

I purchased a lady's venus razor, with two giant moisturising pads - as it had been some time since I'd tended the thicket. This razor is nothing short of incredible. The bathroom light had broken, so I took the plunge and shaved my balls IN THE DARK. Not so much as a nick on my precious testicular cargo. You could have a friend duck tape it to a mop handle and shave your balls for you - blindfolded - from across the room, and you'd still end up with a sack as soft as a newborns cheek."

So you are telling me that because you suck at the game.. the killer must be those things to you? get the fuck out of here lol

You are simply using it like it means something it doesn't. You can claim I am missing kindness or not.. but you are just being willingly ignorant. Get better at the game little kid, and maybe you won't be crying on the internet how people are assholes who have no kindness are detached from reality.. because they don't want to be some sissy killer who lets you live for free.. because if he's not hes not kind.. the fuck? 

The world is harsh grow up, the game is meant for you to survive.. not for the killer to let you live because of certain outcomes.

Oh wait I forgot I live in a society where the children of today think that they are owed something.. and deserve everything handed to them without putting in work.. and learning that you will fail and lose every time.. go run to your safe space if it bothers you so much that.. I will not give a free escape.. just because you and your team suck.

it's competition against the killer for your life you either live cause you are good or you die cause you suck. There is no special treatment, that's just something expect of a sissy because they suck at the game and need someone to hold their hand."

#Remember the human. 
* When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?""
#Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.
#Read the rules of a community before making a submission. 
* These are usually found in the sidebar.
#Read the reddiquette. 
* Read it again every once in a while. Reddiquette is a living, breathing, working document which may change over time as the community faces new problems in its growth.
#Moderate based on quality, not opinion. 
* Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.
#Use proper grammar and spelling. 
* Intelligent discourse requires a standard system of communication. Be open to gentle corrections.
#Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free. 
* If it is an outrageous topic, share your crazy outrage in the comment section.
#Look for the original source of content,
* and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic.
#Post to the most appropriate community possible. 
* Also, consider cross posting if the contents fits more communities.
#Vote. 
* If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.
#Search for duplicates before posting.
* Redundant posts add nothing new to previous conversations. That said, sometimes bad timing, a bad title, or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting story to fail to get noticed. Feel free to post something again if you feel that the earlier posting didn't get the attention it deserved and you think you can do better.
#Link to the direct version of a media file
* if the page it was found on isn't the creator's and doesn't add additional information or context.
#Link to canonical and persistent URLs where possible, 
* not temporary pages that might disappear. In particular, use the ""permalink"" for blog entries, not the blog's index page.
#Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, 
* and do so carefully and tactfully.
#Report 
* any spam you find.
#Browse the new submissions page and vote on it.  
* Regard it, perhaps, as a public service.
#Actually read an article before you vote on it 
* (as opposed to just basing your vote on the title).
#Posts containing explicit material such as nudity, horrible injury etc, 
* add NSFW (Not Safe For Work) for nudity, and tag. However, if something IS safe for work, but has a risqué title, tag as SFW (Safe for Work). Additionally, use your best judgement when adding these tags, in order for everything to go swimmingly.
#State your reason for any editing of posts. 
* Edited submissions are marked by an asterisk (*) at the end of the timestamp after three minutes. For example: a simple ""Edit: spelling"" will help explain. This avoids confusion when a post is edited after a conversation breaks off from it. If you have another thing to add to your original comment, say ""Edit: And I also think..."" or something along those lines.
#Use an ""Innocent until proven guilty"" mentality. 
* Unless there is obvious proof that a submission is fake, or is whoring karma, please don't say it is. It ruins the experience for not only you, but the millions of people that browse reddit every day.
#Read over your submission for mistakes before submitting,
* especially the title of the submission. Comments and the content of self posts can be edited after being submitted, however, the title of a post can't be. Make sure the facts you provide are accurate to avoid any confusion down the line.

#-Please don't-

#Engage in illegal activity.
#Post someone's personal information, 
* or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people too often, and such posts or comments will be removed. Users posting personal info are subject to an immediate account deletion. If you see a user posting personal info, please contact the admins. Additionally, on pages such as Facebook, where personal information is often displayed, please mask the personal information and personal photographs using a blur function, erase function, or simply block it out with color. When personal information is relevant to the post (i.e. comment wars) please use color blocking for the personal information to indicate whose comment is whose.
#Repost deleted/removed information.
* Remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was a picture of gore? Resist the urge to repost it. It doesn't matter what the content was. If it was deleted/removed, it should stay deleted/removed.
#Be (intentionally) rude at all. 
* By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.
 #Follow those who are rabble rousing against another redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's being presented. 
* Those who are inciting this type of action often have malicious reasons behind their actions and are, more often than not, a troll. Remember, every time a redditor who's contributed large amounts of effort into assisting the growth of community as a whole is driven away, projects that would benefit the whole easily flounder.
#Ask people to Troll others on reddit, 
* in real life, or on other blogs/sites. We aren't your personal army.
#Conduct personal attacks on other commenters.  
* Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.
#Start a flame war. 
* Just report and ""walk away"". If you really feel you have to confront them, leave a polite message with a quote or link to the rules, and no more.
#Insult others. 
* Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged.
#Troll.  
* Trolling does not contribute to the conversation.
#Take moderation positions in a community where your profession, 
* employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.

#In regard to voting

#Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. 
* Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.
#Mass downvote someone else's posts. 
* If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.
#Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source. 
* Quality of content is more important than who created it.
#Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. 
* Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.
 #Report posts just because you do not like them. 
* You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules.
#In regard to promoting reddit posts
#Hint at asking for votes. 
* (""Show me some love!"", ""Is this front page worthy?"", ""Vote This Up to Spread the Word!"", ""If this makes the front page, I'll adopt this stray cat and name it reddit"", ""If this reaches 500 points, I'll get a tattoo of the Reddit alien!"", ""Upvote if you do this!"", ""Why isn't this getting more attention?"", etc.)
#Conduct polls using the title of your submission and/or votes. 
* These methods are not reliable because of vote fuzzing and are in that regard just asking for upvotes.
#Send out IMs, tweets, or any other message asking people to vote for your submission 
* — or comply when other people ask you. This will result in a ban from the admins. Your submission should get points for being good, not because the submitter is part of a voting clique.
#Ask for upvotes in exchange for gifts or prizes. 
* ""Upvote me to the top and I'll give away ...""
#Create mass downvote or upvote campaigns.  
* This includes attacking a user's profile history when they say something bad and participating in karma party threads.

#In regard to new submissions

#Use the word ""BREAKING"" or other time sensitive words in your submissions. 
* By the time your post reaches the front page, it probably won't be 'breaking' anymore.
#Post hoaxes 
* If snopes.com has already declared something false, you probably shouldn't be submitting it to reddit.
#Flood reddit with a lot of stories in a short span of time. 
* By doing this you flood the new queue. Be warned, your future submissions may be automatically blocked by the spam filter. Shadow banning (you can see your posts and votes, but no one else can) can, and will, take place in more severe cases.
#Write titles in ALL CAPS. 
#Editorialize or sensationalize your submission title.
#Linkjack stories: 
* linking to stories via blog posts that add nothing extra.
#Use link shorteners to post your content.
* There are few reasons to hide what you're linking to, and most of them are sneaky (if you are, use the ""preview"" feature that those services offer).

#In regard to comments

#Make comments that lack content. 
* Phrases such as ""this"", ""lol"", and ""I came here to say this"" are not witty, original, or funny, and do not add anything to the discussion.
#Announce your vote
*  (with rare exceptions). ""Upvote"" and ""Downvote"" aren't terribly interesting comments and only increase the noise to signal ratio.
#Complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content. 
* Users should give credit where credit should be given, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.
#Complain about the votes you do or do not receive, 
* especially by making a submission voicing your complaint. You may have just gotten unlucky. Try submitting later or seek out other communities to submit to. Millions of people use reddit; every story and comment gets at least a few up/downvotes. Some up/downvotes are by reddit to fuzz the votes in order to confuse spammers and cheaters. This also includes messaging moderators or admins complaining about the votes you did or did not receive, except when you suspect you've been targeted by vote cheating by being massively up/downvoted.
#Complain about reposts. Just because you have seen it before doesn't mean everyone has. 
* Votes indicate the popularity of a post, so just vote. Keep in mind that linking to previous posts is not automatically a complaint; it is information. 
 #Complain about cross posts. 
* Just because you saw it in one place, doesn't mean everyone has seen it. Just vote and move on."

Ask parents for Shrek themed party.

Just like the last 12 years.

Mom says I'm too old for Shrek

Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself

Mom asks if I've taken my meds.

I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.

Mom says no.

I call her a Farquaad bitch.

She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.

Jacking off will probably cheer me up.

Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection

Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.

Its the 171st day of the year.

Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.

Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.

Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.

Start to think about fight with mother again.

Get an idea.

Sneak out of room.

Mom is sleeping.

Go to shed in backyard

Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.

Stand outside Mom's door.

Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.

The scent of onions fill the room.

A green hand takes the tool from me.

""I'll take it from here laddie."" Shrek says.

Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.

The stabbing went on for almost an hour.

Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.

Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.

I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.

Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.

Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.

But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.

Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.

All of them are just as nude as Shrek.

Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.

Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.

He still has me in one hand.

He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.

His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.

Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.

Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.

Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.

It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.

I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.

I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.

All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.

I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.

As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.

It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.

I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's ""little Donkey"" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.

Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.

Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.

He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.

It is the greatest moment of my life.

I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.

The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.

I am now 33% cock.

I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.

Then, it happened.

Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.

Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.

Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.

My eyes roll back in my head.

I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.

It isn't ogre yet.

I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.

Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.

I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.

Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.

My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.

After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.

Seconds later mine is done too.

I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.

But it still isn't ogre.

I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.

She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.

It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.

Between gulps, I gargle ""Shrek is love. Shrek is life.""

I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.

I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.

I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.

Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.

I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.

Finally I have a family who cares for me.

After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.

I find a note on the door.

""I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy.""

Prince Charming?

PRINCE CHARMING?

copypasta,"Y'all know I grew up in Pakistan, right? I truly believe the roaches from all over the world came from that country alone, specificaily from Karachi. One day, I come home from a long abusive school day of continuous being called a ""chutiya"" by those bullies. And I noticed no one's home, think they went to my cousins wedding (two of them married each other. It’s normal there) so I was like ”aiiiight"" imma sleep alone naked upstairs. I threw my school uniform off turned the fan on and pointed that shit or my underdeveloped dick. Oh Boy, that was truly a nice feeling. Imagine your balls being trapped all day in 100F heat. It was so hot that it cooked some of my sperm I had.  That cool breeze to my balls knocks me out. I'm having some bomb ass dreams. Like me coming to America and playing with white girls titties and owning a PlayStation. Later I had this crazy ass dream. This is when I had my first wet dream. i remember this shit like it was yesterday. It felt so real. I was getting my dick touched by this goddess and she had some soft hands. Like this bitch applied shea butter thoroughly. It felt like my dick was inside of nice warm potato with extra butter. I was young at the time but I remember i felt this tingly feeling like nutting, it felt like McDonald’s sprite was coming out my penis hole. That shit woke me up. I look at my dick and i saw a roach rubbing his wings on my dick bruh. Lowkey I let that mf do this thing and then I heard a door bell and moved so fast then that mf flew away. I had a flying roach give me top bruh. I can not make this up. I’ve been sleeping without my pants since then in hopes of getting top 3y a roach again. Lowkey hope it was a female roach though."

It's horrendous and ugly. I hate it. The point of emojis is to show emotions, but what emotion does this show? Do you just wake up in the morning and think ""wow, I really feel like a massive fucking stone today""? It's useless. I hate it. It just provokes a deep rooted anger within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and kill it. If this was the emoji movie I'd push it off a fucking cliff. People just comment 🗿 as if it's funny. It's not. 🗿 deserves to die. He deserves to have his smug little stone face smashed in with a hammer. Oh wow, it's a stone head, how fucking hilarious, I'll use it in every comment I post. NO.

copypasta,"And, just to note it, my companies have done 4 IPOs over the years. You’ve touched products I’ve been involved in developing at least a dozen times before you’ve had your Frosted Flakes in the morning. Three of the four had my hard $$ in as “Founders Stock” capital. We were doing a lot of consumer grade networking/peripherals/mobile stuff— some of which is VERY ubiquitous today. Like literally EVERYWHERE you look in phones and PCs and entertainment products. There’s a reason I live in Montecito, with vacation homes in London, Park City and Maui. And, yeah, sheepishly I admit to owning 50+ cars.


Full disclosure: I have “issues” with the wild amounts of VC capital (and now IPO capital) being thrown at concept stories. Too much money was made in the first-wave bubble, then turned into “Web 2.0"", “sharing economy” and “green concept” stories... a lot of which got public without making any money. Tesla is just a company that never should have been unleashed on the public markets— Musk would have the needed oversight if he had some impatient Menlo Park VCs to keep happy as a private company. As it is, his tantrums over SEC rules really boil down to him wanting to “froth the market” with crazy predictions, to drive stock price and irrational market behavior. Those “tendencies” are exactly why there is an SEC. I have no idea when his board eventually “grows a pair” and boots him, but it’s the only way Tesla can survive. This from a guy who Did His Sentence on Sand Hill Road after several successful CTO and CEO stints... including the IPOs. Tesla presents the same board-and-governance challenges any struggling company faces... and the tool kit to fix those are well known. Musk should have been canned over the Solar City fiasco. Solar City is dead, but nobody can find the body. Here’s a fun trick—

copypasta,"I have an insatiable minion rape fetish. It is my ultimate fantasy to be gagged, tied up, and brutally assfucked by Kevin the Minion. I have accrued tens of thousands in debt attempting to fill this void with sexual ""toys,"" including several custom dildos and a modified Kevin-shaped plush doll with a twelve-inch yellow strap-on. The wife and I are separated, and I have accepted the fact that I will never see my kids again. The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep, inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death. The truth is, I died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. I came home from the premiere of Despicable Me rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin the Minion would never, could never pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible yellow girth, and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration. It has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that. My apartment is a squalid den of inescapable despair, filled with jizz-stained Kevin the Minion dolls and tormented notes etched onto lewd posters of Kevin the Minion. My only friends are the roaches. My God, I am going to die here. Banana."

copypasta,"AntiqueT- This is rich.

You can stop right there. You have no idea what I know. You don't know me or the extent to which I've studied mythology.


You've already admitted I was Right, though. You even used that stupid Ben Franklin quote about needing to close the Eyes of Reason to see with the Eyes of Faith. And its super Ironic since you don't know me, and yet you are perfectly comfortable saying I am irrational.

That's not going to work, s it makes you a liar and a hypocrite. I won't abide begn called delusional or irrational by a moron like you who Thinks you can just bully others to inflate your own ego.



 Yes, there are bigots who want to tear down Christianity, but I have no interest in doing so.


This is also a Lie. You do have an interest in doing so or you'd not have posted the Childish attack on the Bible and asked if I had read it. You want to pretend you are sophisticated and clever and too smart for the old Christian Faith, and need to Lord that over people as if repeating like a recording rubbish everypnes heard now somehow makes you Enlightened.



 People should let people believe what they want to, as long as it doesn't harm anyone. Every atheist I've met would agree.


No, they don't. All you have to do is look at basically every Atheism website on the net, or read comment sections on Youtube. Mocking and berating people for ot being Atheists, and in particular vilifying and mocking Christains and openly advocating for people to hate Religion in general and Christianity in particular is so common that I doubt you'd be unaware of it.




 We don't want to get rid of your religion, or any religion.


That's not exactly True either, is it?

I mean, you tell me that I have shit the eyes of Reason below, so you are trying to shame me here.


And again, Atheism is the basis for a new Religion we are supposed to Think is not a Religion but a lack of belief in a god, whose members do actively state their goal is to destroy all Religion.

So don't hand me that crap.


I mean sure, not all Atheists are like that, but you did say we and meant all Atheists and personally, I'm just as sick of this idiotic pretence that Atheist are innocent and just want to voice their opinion as I am of hearing the Bible get slagged off  on.


After all, you mocked the Bible, I didn't attack you for not believing in it. You made that Decision and you are the aggressor here.



And telling me I am irrational doesn't exactly make me want to give you any benefit of a doubt.





 If you want to shut the eye of reason to open the eye of faith, that's your deal.

You do realise that this whole idea that Faith is irrational is itself nonsense, Right? Faith can be based on Reason.

Also, don't hand me the Dogma from your Religion that Faith is belief without evidence. Its not. Its not even belief without evidence when we are discussing Religious Faith, as that is not ""The Religious definition of Faith"".

Ben Franklin was a womanising cowardly narcissistic, and his words mean nothing to me, other than how you are using them to insult not only me, but all Christians.


You don't have to shut the eyes of Reason to see with Faith, and Christians aren't irrational. Just like Atheists aren't really the Champions of Reason they say they are.





 I might laugh at you in private, but why would I want to stop you?



You laughed at Christians in public.

So stop lying about that."

copypasta,"This may sound a bit weird and creepy, but I think it would actually be kinda cool to find a fallen, vaguely humanoid, pale skinned demon staring at me through the window pane in the middle of the night.    
    
I would quietly show it into my dimly lit parlour and drop my robe, revealing my firm, tender flesh, and my wet young cunt.   
     
I dance for the demonic being, running my finger down it's slime covered chest until I reach it's throbbing cock buried within it's hairy crotch. The demon screams.    
    
In one swift motion, I have the hell-spawn on the floor, and mount it's large mephistophelic phallus. I am moaning in pleasure as the hard, hooved, demon cock fills my dripping loins.    
    
My demonic lover howls in pleasure, ripping open my abdomen with its sharp bony fingers as it cums.    
    
I am shivering in pain and excitement as the monster begins to gnaw upon my spilling viscera, and soon, I join it in the consumption of my own guts, savouring the raw post-orgasmic meal even as I rapidly fade into death, induced by the consumption of my ruptured vitals. So fucking hot lol"
copypasta,"You have to remember.....Paris has been disarmed. Which means rioting is as far as this can ever go.  Parisians are now like the weak little ANTIFA rock and bottle throwers of the USA.    Even many of the Paris Police are not carrying guns.     

There will never be another French Revolution because what was once a living France is now a disarmed and enslaved France full of disarmed subservient individuals who vote for other weak individuals like Macron..who will never take a stand against Islam..... So continue on and allow Muslims to rape your women on the streets....and you can continue to react by smashing a few windows and take out your lighters and light more cars on fire in a effort to make yourself feel like men.

That fact is you are out gunned and now enslaved just like Saudi Arabia.....As Paris along with most other European countries will be enslaved by the fast growing ARMY of Islam hides within a Trojan Horse disguised as a Religion of Peace, then rolls over our weak bribed politician forced opened borders....so that your own high tax welfare systems can be used to build the ARMY of your own destruction !!!!

Here is the USA, we will never give up our capable Rifles.  And we do not have to burn cars in the streets.  We are armed to the teeth, and if any Gov police or military try to take our guns.....which is happening Right Now in the USA....As our corrupt Democrat Politicians are trying to gain power and pass hundreds of bad gun laws to disarm us....we will fight back.

And many of our police support the Republican Patriots who are now taking control of our Government.  Because good police do not enjoy being told to take guns by force  from good citizens and enter into a shoot-out....Just because a few bad Democrat Politicians in California, New York, and other US states voted for anti-2nd Amendment Laws.

This video did a much better job in defining the details of the Paris Riot Root-Causes than most other news sources.

However, I believe that the cost of the Muslim and other Migration is costing more taxes than is being reported. 

What was not addressed in this video is that many Parisian Hotels have been taken and purchased or leased using taxes to house Muslim Migrants....those Hotels no-longer provide taxes.....and the surrounding businesses are also folding because the streets are no-longer safe with Muslim Gangs."
copypasta,"I think it’s absolutely moronic to cover your body in non-existent characters from some show that gets more attention than it deserves just because it’s form some nation in Asia which is fetishised like nothing else. These characters don’t give advice or reason. They don’t give people faith. They are good for nothing except a short burst of entertainment, which you of course forgot the second you looked at your phone or another anime.

Like this show and its influence on you, this is something you’ll have forgotten when you’ve found a new show where you can jerk of to skin toned balls with two massive eyes because the artist wasn’t given the budget or was just incapable of expressing emotion so he just made the head two massive fucking eyes. The characters could be between 13 and 23 and when asked you’ll say they’re 18+, but the second you can look at those badly designed uncreative characters created from a template with the only recognisable features being the wacky colour of hair or the amount of useless belts you’ll just think to yourself they are a perfect 14 years old.

One day you’ll look yourself in the mirror and realise that each and every human character in anime is one of 20 designs, you’ll realise what you’ve waisted your life on and your back if you had this tattooed. The second after the realisation you’ll just post something on r/blunderyears to get your imaginary, useless internet points that have absolutely no effect on you besides making you more and more insecure about what others think of you.

The moment I told myself I didn’t care what people thought of me I knew, somewhere deep inside I was lying like a coked up Vietnamese whore promising to mary someone. Look at me standing in the mirror applying the perfect hair foam product just so I can say:”fuck I have bad hair” even though I fucking know I’ve got great hair. Look at me standing in the closet looking at the blouses and sweaters contemplating which one I’ll wear as if my fucking future depended on it.

And yet here I lie, in my comfortable bed telling myself I don’t care. What a fucking joke. Whilst the sound of rolling tyres dances upon my eardrums I know that all those cars are driving due to some time limit, or appointment they gotta make on “time”. Time is a curse that rules your life like the bills you carry in your pocket. Time is a curse that ends when the afterlife starts. Nothing is infinite. The day, the night, your youth, my dreams, our hope and the sun just to name a few, but death is the only thing that outlast all of us as it is the only infinite I know."

Well the bro-dough is gonna fly outta there with a bit more force than you're used to, and certainly with greater volume. You will get some of that man butter on your head if you're sitting in the right position. Few know that the cum possesses power over females. If u leave that good stuff in your hair, you will not only look like this cool kid, but women will smell your nut butter and be instinctually drawn to you. THAT'S how you lose your virginity, boys. Trust me, it works."
copypasta,"1. The Time The Animatronic Fox Made Eye Contact With Me:

I was riding Splash Mountain, and the animatronic fox was doing his preprogrammed speech about how he wanted to catch the animatronic rabbit. The fox said, “Now’s our chance to set a trap for Br’er Rabbit!” Then it turned and looked me right in the eyes and said, “I’m going to marry your dad, Ryan.” Then the fox leaned in real close to my face, which I’m pretty sure it was not programmed to do, and he said, “Call me ‘Mrs. Dad,’ Ryan. I’m going to be your dad’s bride at his wedding.” Before he could say anything else, I had floated away from him to enjoy the rest of the magic of Splash Mountain.

2. The Time The Animatronic Fox Kept Talking About How Long The Wedding Would Take When He Married My Dad:

The big drop at the end of Splash Mountain was so fun that I decided to get back in line and ride it again. I was having a blast listening to all the robotic animals sing and move around until the animatronic fox once again turned to me as I floated past. It started to say, “You sure done made a fool of yourself, Br’er Bear!” but about halfway through the line he trailed off, turned around, and said, “Welcome back, Ryan. I’m going to marry your religious dad and the wedding is going to take forever. Everyone’s going to talk so slow and your dad and I are going to kiss 100 times. Your dad is going to get down on his knees and thank Christ for making his wedding to the robot fox take so long.” I tried to tell the robotic fox that I didn’t want that to happen, but I had already floated away from him.

3. The Time The Animatronic Fox Told Me That He Was Going To Wear My Clothes When He Married My Dad;

I had decided not to go on Splash Mountain anymore, but then I remembered how fun the big drop at the end was and I got back in line. I was hoping the animatronic fox would just do his clockwork movements and prerecorded lines, but instead he popped up out of the water in the middle of the ride and said, “Your dad is my fiancé, Ryan. I’m going to wear your shirts and your pants when I marry your dad. Your dad’s going to wear a wedding dress and we’re going to be bonded in the eyes of Christ. Enjoy the rest of Splash Mountain, Ryan.” After the ride, I told the Disney World employee working the line what had happened, and he just said, “That sounds bad.” But he didn’t do anything

4. The Time The Fox’s Voice Came Out Of The Animatronic Goose:

I just couldn’t stay away from that incredible drop at the end of Splash Mountain, so I got right back in line. There is an animatronic goose on Splash Mountain who mostly sings and babbles about being careful on rivers. One time, when I was floating past the goose, it stopped singing, swiveled on its metal hinges to face me, and said to me in the fox’s voice, “Ryan, it’s me. It’s the fox. I’m going to marry the ever-loving shit out of your religious dad. Listen to me, Ryan. Our wedding will not have any refreshments. Guests will be permitted to bring one bowl of warm water from home, but that’s it. Once I marry your dad, I’m going to become a huge part of your life. Have fun on the big drop.” Then the goose’s voice returned to normal and it sang a song about fishing. I do not want to attend a wedding where there is no food, especially since the fox said it was also going to be very long.

5. The Time An Animatronic Model Of My Dad Appeared Next To The Fox:

I had promised myself I would never ride Splash Mountain again, but on the last day of vacation, the siren song of the big, fun drop lured me right back into the den of the clockwork fox and his wet carnival of torment. When I got to the animatronic fox, he was standing next to an animatronic model of my father, which sparked and sputtered as he moved back and forth in repetitious motion. My log boat stopped right at that scene, which it hadn’t done any of the other times before, and the animatronic fox started saying things like, “Hello, Ryan. Your dad and I are going to be each other’s wives,” and, “You’ll have to watch me marry your dad through the window of the church because you’re not allowed inside, Ryan.” Then the animatronic model of my dad said, “I love marrying the fox more than I love having a son!” and then it burst into flames. As the ride finally lurched forward on the river and I floated away from this horrific scene, the fox called after me, “I’ll see you and your real dad at the wedding, Ryan!” I tried to call back, “Please don’t do this!” but my voice was drowned out by the sound of the robot porcupine singing about the dangers of being foolhardy."

This is neither good nor bad, it merely is. You don’t get angry at a hurricane, as it wouldn’t care or understand. Yet, there is a strange comfort to that expectation for those brave enough to take their curiosity in hand and boldly plunge into an otherwise unclicked, unexplored link. For either new, as yet unseen visual treasures and knowledge awaits, or a large veiny member that may as well leap off the screen and poke you in the eye.

Stay bold my friend. Good on you. Click that link."

copypasta,"Alright boys, time for a little story

Adadaru-Sin stood on the walls of the great city of Ugarit was running out of crops, supplies, and men. The great King stood watching from behind the stone walls to see the green sea shimmering under the orange shine of the Mediterranean dawn sun. The streak of light made a line from the sun, between the vast waters, to the harbor by the beach. The last of the merchant ships went back and forth from wooden docks to unload and set sail to the distant lands. The ships from the north stopped months ago; the land of Hatti was barren and ruined. The men inland were fighting among each other. All who were left were the people on the Eastern shores of the great sea and the great empire of Kemet by the river to the South. 
Adadaru-Sin was a new soldier. He heard of all the lands from the Zagros mountains to Alashiya in the West, but he never went there. His thirst for knowledge of the places beyond the farms of Ugarit lived on since the first sails he laid eyes on. Adadaru-Sin joined the King's men in arms with his own spear and armour, purchased with his own crops from his own farm. With the great powers falling, he knew it would soon be his day to join the front lines. 
Until then, Adadaru-Sin stood on the northern wall, placed into the 4th infantry group, sacrificing cattle to Anat with his buddy Tabnit and occasionally Tanathe, daughter of a smith who made Adadaru-Sin's spear-tip out of rough bronze. The boy took a liking to the young woman. A farm boy to a city girl. 
The farm boy stood by the far edge of the walls thinking. Thinking about Tanathe, thinking about Tabnit who was right by his shoulder, and thinking about the friends left behind on the farm to live the same life as before, the same life as their parents and their parents' parents. Adadaru-Sin was not going to live the same life.
He didn't think it was going to be the day, it seemed to calm. He thought he would march with his men, but instead fate came to the walls of his city. Instead, fate came on tracks.
In the distance a faint rumble erupted with a bang every once in a while. Adadaru-Sin knew what to do. The bangs were a battle cry from the foe. Whether it was the Hittites, Amorites, or Apiru didn't matter. It was his time to shine. The men at the walls readied themselves and raised their bows. Chariots came out to face the enemies. The wheeled ranks lined up and sped towards the invader, but they did not get an army. A shell of a giant green turtle rolled towards the chariots. The spearmen readied their spears, the drivers drove the horses. Before any bronze has been thrown the shells went out of the turtle's barrel and fuCKING EXPLODED. The horses ran one way and the other, crashing into their brothers and fuCKING DYING. 
The shell rolled towards the walls, shot a shell and the wall fuCKING EXPLODED. It was at this point that Adadaru-Sin knew he fucked up. His buddy Tabnit was under the rubble by then, and the turtle's barrel SHOT A SHELL AT THE FUCKIN WALL AND ROLLED THROUGH THE BRICKS, BREAKING THE SIDES AND COLLAPSING MORE ON THE WALL. THE HOUSES WERE TURNED INTO RUBBLE BY THE TANKS TRACKS AND SHELLS, THE KING BLOWN UP BY A GODDAM TANK IN THE 1200S.
Adadaru-Sin tried to run, but the head of the turtle turned around to look at him before the barrel went down, then back up. The barrel was nodding. it was driven by Ben Shapiro.
""Another city rekt,"" Adadaru-Sin said, nodding back to the tank. 

Anyways, if you take away the last bit that's how I think it would go down.

I'm not sure if I broke any rules but eh."

copypasta,"Here's a good lore story.

Steve looks like the zombies in the game, and they try to kill him... Correct? There are abandoned mineshafts with rail tracks and carts, as well as gunpowder for presumably TNT within the mines. I think that Steve was a miner, as well as the infected miners because of the main theme of mining. It's his profession before you start the game. A iron miner sent from the old world. The turned miners wear the same clothes as steve because the mining company had the miners wear uniforms. The company owner John (give me name suggestions) wanted to come to this unknown new world for ""resources"", and to find the recorded stronghold. I'll explain why at the end. Now, the ender dragon/enderman are like the protectors of the end dimension who observe all other dimensions, and they destroyed the end city civilization that had ships with literally the Dragons head on them to transport resources much like the miners, because they were naturally destructive to them. In turn, humans from the past had tried to kill the ender dragon because of altercations with enderman, which is why the strong holds existed, but they where apparently killed by the enderman for obvious reasons before they could succeed in Finishing the portal. The human soldiers were killed and their bodies laid to rot into skeletons with bows as their weapons, and where necromanced by witches after they'd been killed to be reused to kill the miners (this explains why the villagers aren't afraid/don't get attacked by the skeletons). Witches had been experimenting with biological diseases, which they'd already used to zombify and make brain dead the pigman when they went there to explore. I assume when they first did, the pigman were hostile and possibly attacked the witches and followed them to attack the villagers, so the witches and clerics researched things and the witches had secret labs in their igloo bunkers. This would explain why villagers are terrified of zombie pigmen. The new illager leaders formed during the pigman invasions determined the miners as Invaders and as a threat to the Testificate race. The witches are forced to give up knowledge of the disease, which the illagers use on the intimidating miners from the mining company. It infects people, which starts the zombie out break in the overworld. The Drowned used to be uninfected ship transporters for the resources of the mining company to the old world, hence the sunken ships. They were normal people employed by John but ended up infected. The neather is essentially hell, with the pigman civilization being destroyed by the villagers (witches) and newly formed illager country through disease, they are brain dead with green spores decaying their bodies.

Steve came from the old world with his brother and best friend.

Steve survived but without knowing what was really going on, so when he escaped the mines when they where being attacked by the turning miners and necromanced skeleton army from the witches, he was obviously confused. His brother Clark and best friend Danny, do not survive the attack(reference btw). He is bitten by one of the miner zombies, and falls unconscious. A witch or someone possibly saves him, meaning they know how to cure the zombie miners (a great idea for future Minecraft when better human-like ai is developed more, that way you can cure miner zombies to get human-like ai characters to play with. Plus it fits the story Arc). So he awoke with amnesia(a side effect) and in a far away unknown place with nothing...

This is where the game begins, early morning(or maybe longer as I'll explain later) after the killing, with Steve eventually finding out the truth.

He learns the ways of this strange new world. He meets villagers, and protects them from the zombies and illagers/pillagers because the illager leaders go full on dictator and think the villagers are inferior to them. Things like enchanting and other dimensions he learns. He finds out what happened to the civilizations within libraries in places through out the world. He literally goes to hell and back to find out his past, and the truth. He finds out pockets of miners survived throughout the world because he finds some zombies with armor and tools. He finds out who is responsible, and he takes the steps to avenge all the civilizations, miners, strongholdsman and villigers. He kills the illager leaders. He kills the ender dragon. Steve finds the end cities and retrieves the Elytra, he obtains the trident, the diamond sword and beyond man abilities. Kills the wither and reins dominant(protector) over all the new land. He dreams of his old world wife Alex accompanying him from time to time on his journey. She's in his memory from time to time in glimpses (good emotional character for Steve). She is his drive to continue. He is strong in the beginning though and has the will to survive alone. Steve is either the villain, or the Hero of this salty world.  In either case...

He becomes god of the new world.﻿"

Kendrick has spent the last 2 months traveling across the country with his idol and mentor, Kanye West, who was currently on stage right now. The tour life can be exhausting, and also somewhat lonely. Kendrick hasn't seen or been in contact with Sherane in months, and his young libido was still beating. The road groupies sufficed for the time being, but there was a hole in Kendrick's heart. He needed more. He wanted more. He wanted Kanye. But he didn't know how to tell him. Kanye was married with children; Kendrick wasn't even entirely sure he was bisexual. But after seeing Kanye's interview on Kris Jenner, he thought maybe he had a chance.

Kendrick looked into the mirror and began to cry. He knew that he could never have Kanye. He could never be with Kanye. Hell, he could never rap as well as Kanye. No matter how many syllables Kendrick spit, Kanye always beat him.

All of a sudden, Kendrick jumped a little as he felt strong hands grab his shoulders and start to massage them lightly. Once he recognized the hands as Kanye's, he relaxed and let his mentor take care of him. Before he knew it, trails of kisses were being traced down his neck and collarbone, only being briefly interrupted as Kanye slid Kendrick's shirt off of his chest. Kanye smiled and leaned into the caress.

Kanye's lips moved to Kendrick's ear, ""Very nicely done tonight, by the way."" he laughed a bit before nibbling on his ear lobe. ""I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago"" he whispered seductively into Kendrick's ear. Kendrick's only response was a soft moan as Kanye pulled him back towards him so Kendrick could clearly feel his growing erection pressed against him. ""Would you like some Yeezy in your Serato?"" Kanye teased as he kissed Kendrick chubby cheeks.

Kendrick grinned and twisted his head so he could reach Ye's lips to kiss him. ""How do you say 'fuck me' in Spanish? Me no hablo."" they both laughed before they kissed again, softly.

Ye kissed down Kendrick's chest, especially slowing down to pay attention to Kendrick's sensitive nipples. As he sucked gently, he looked at Kendrick's face. The way that he bit his lip and squirmed under Kanye's touch only egged him on further. His hand slipped down to the bulge in Kendrick's jeans and gently started to massage it gently as his mouth still moved slowly downward. As his tongue slid along Kendrick's abdominal muscles, he undid Kendrick's leather jogging pants and helped him to slide them and his pyrex vision boxers down to his ankles so he could more easily kick them off.

Kanye took the head of Kendrick's penis into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, making Kendrick elicit moans of pleasure to the sensation. ""Ye, I know you want this dick..."" he breathed as he moved his hips up to try to encourage Kanye to take him in further.

Ye removed his lips from Kendrick's head to lick along his shaft and take his scrotum into his mouth. He gently sucked on one of Kendrick's tesitcles at a time, making sure that he enjoyed the sensation, but that he was teasing him, just a bit. He used his right hand to massage Kendrick's testicles as he again wrapped his lips around the shaft of his long, slender penis. He took as much as he could into his mouth, having not managed to master the art of deepthroating yet, and bobbed his head slowly up and down, savoring Kendrick's salty taste and his every moan. Kanye fed off of Kendrick's pleasure, doing his best to repeat every little thing he did that caused him to moan louder, squirm against the couch, or grip his hair tighter in pleasure.

Kendrick moaned loudly again, panting. ""Fuck... Ye, I'm gonna... Fuck, I'm gonna cum..."" he exclaimed as his hips bucked, releasing streams of hot, sweet cum into Kanye's welcoming mouth. Kanye did his best to swallow it all, although a few drops dripped from his lips. After swallowing what was in his mouth, he greedily licked up the drops that spilled.

Kendrick panted as Kanye kissed up his chest, more quickly than his earlier decent. His lips pressed against Kendrick's greedily, his own lust having grown from his pleasure derived from Kendrick's orgasm. He pulled away gently from the kiss, smiling down at Kendrick.

""Is it my turn?"" he laughed as Kendrick nodded and stretched his neck to plant a kiss on Kanye jaw.

All of a sudden, both Kendrick and Kanye were startled by the sound of something falling in the closet next to them. Out of nowhere, Schoolboy Q falls out of the closet, with his pants down around his ankles and his dick in his hand. Schoolboy had been in the closet masturbating to Ye and Kendrick the entire time. Schoolboy jumped up, screamed “GONORHERRA NIGGA SKEET SKEET” and ran out the door.

Kendrick, Kanye, nor Schoolboy ever spoke of the event again."
copypasta,"Yea, my school pretty much banned people from saying no homo. Last week, two or three kids got in trouble for saying no homo and the fucking POLICE were called.

copypasta,"Well I wrote this song for the christian youth
I wanna teach kids, the christian truth
If you wanna reach those kids on the street
Then you gotta do a rap, do a hip-hop beat.

I gave my surmon a urban kick
My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
That's cuz Jesus Christ is my nigga.

Oooooooo

Hes a life-changer, miracle-arranger
Born to the virgin mom in a manger
Water to wine, hes a drink exchanger
And he died for your sins.

I preach the word, thats my gig
And I rhyme better than Notorious BIG
Other MC's.. I wish them well
But if you live in sin, you burn in hell.

Now I'm a pass the mic to my lovely wife
Shes a fly MC and the light of my life
So to bust a rhyme without further ado
Take it away Mary Sue!

Jesus Christ is my nigga...
Hes the son of the original G
And he was sent to Earth to illusidate(?) the way that we should be.

Whaat??

Liiike if another MC says
""Your a freak!
You're a lame-(?) rapper
And your rhymes are weak!""
I don't get mad and I don't critique
I forgive him, and turn the other cheek

I don't blaspheme and I don't brag
I don't cuss, and my pants don't sag
I do it (?) a little christian swag
And I'm proud to be... an American!

Jesus Christ is my nigga.
And his light shines through ya!
(?) pop a cap in your butt and say HALLELUJAH!

Jesus Christ is my nigga.
He's a homie MC JC UC?
He's a honest, caring, peace loving nigga
Like me.

copypasta,"Fuck pigeons man, if you lived with them you'd understand. There are ACRES of green around my balcony, there are literally hundreds of other, cleaner, less used, more spacious balconies METERS away from mine, but the dumbass birds keep coming back.

copypasta,"Just as the cheers begin to strike a raucous chord, the camera pans onto Mr. Ratburn, and he eyes it in seductively in return, with that little Jim smile plastered on his face. A thunderous call comes over the loudspeaker -

“This is Chris Wallace reporting in from Birmingham, following the landmark decision for Alabama to secede from the Union after a controversial Arthur episode, sources say Trump has....”

The camera pans out towards the Alabama state courthouse. The governor, now supreme commander, Kay Ivey sits on his Iron Throne of AK-47’s, as 3 eyed 4 armed citizens try their best to recite the 10 commandments, lest they be sold into slavery. 

“.... decided to pursue an immediate nuclear retaliation”

A mushroom cloud tide rolls over the state of Alabama as every breathing citizen is aborted immediately. A Navy Seal team scours the area with their heartbeat scanners, yet there is no sign of life to be found in the desolate hellscape - almost as bad as before the bomb was dropped.

And on the other monitor still, there’s Mr. Ratburn, as the anchorman moves in closer and closer, you see his rat-face coil into a menacing grin. He twirls his husband like an ice dancer and bends him down for a deep kiss. He looks up from his moment of ecstasy and speaks directly into the camera with a debonaire grin “I guess I’m a real rat bastard aren’t I?”"

The only thing keeping Karen from divorcing me is the fear that she might be the final push into a deep, inescapable abyss, at the bottom of which lies my death. The truth is, I died nine years ago on the night I met the love of my life. I came home from the premiere of Despicable Me rock hard, collapsing in the shower and sobbing at the realization that Kevin the Minion would never, could never pin me down with his perfectly smooth body and stubby arms, penetrate me with his incredible yellow girth, and empty his huge, aching balls deep inside my tummy. I sat there all night, sometimes weeping, sometimes ramming my flaccid dick into the shower drain in frustration. It has been nine years since that night. I have nothing now. I have accepted that.

Tell me, do you go to sleep every night hoping that you'll have something to wake up for? It can be easy to deny the things that are put there right in front of our faces, but life can be a challenge.

Certainly, the path through Christ is not an easy one. There are times when even I doubt my own faith, but this road is also rewarding.

I'm not asking you to ask for forgiveness and drop to your knees all in one night, but I would urge you to consider taking a look at these links:

1.	⁠http://pjsaunders.blogspot.com/2013/01/twenty-good-arguments-for-christianity.html?m=1 -- This will explain how Christianity can be backed up through science and the medical community.
2.	⁠http://www.sharefaith.com/guide/christian-apologetics/christian-arguments-against-atheism.html -- This will help address some of your concerns in relation to much of the pro-atheism sentiment that frequents this site.

I'm not demanding anything. I'm not even asking. All I'm saying is, here are the links. If you read them, you may find yourself falling asleep with something to wake up for.

I appreciate your time."

copypasta,"You’re 22.

Be turning 23 soon.

Ask parents for Shrek themed party.

Just like the last 12 years.

Mom says I'm too old for Shrek

Tell her she better check herself before she Shrek's herself

Mom asks if I've taken my meds.

I say yes, then ask for an onion flavored cake.

Mom says no.

I call her a Farquaad bitch.

She sends me to my room and tears stream down my face.

Jacking off will probably cheer me up.

Pull out super dreck MLP Friendship is Magic DVD collection

Open them up to see five Shrek discs (including Puss in Boots) that my mom thought were in her room.

Its the 171st day of the year.

Today I am scheduled to masturbate to Artie from Shrek the Third.

Fap furiously when Artie appears and am finished in seconds.

Wipe semen off my chest with Twilight Sparkle stuffed pony.

Start to think about fight with mother again.

Get an idea.

Sneak out of room.

Mom is sleeping.

Go to shed in backyard

Grab the sharpest tool in the shed.

Stand outside Mom's door.

Too chicken to do it. I pray to Shrek for courage.

The scent of onions fill the room.

A green hand takes the tool from me.

""I'll take it from here laddie."" Shrek says.

Shrek plants the tool deep in my mother's body ogre and ogre again.

The stabbing went on for almost an hour.

Blood sprayed all ogre the room and on my body. Especially my hands and arms.

Shrek is finally finished with my mother and he looks at me.

I pull off my blood soaked clothes and poke my butt in the air.

Shrek picks me up with one hand and uses his Schlong to sweep the remains of my mother off of her bed.

Despite the carnage, it still smells like onions.

But now the smell of waffles and litter enter the room as well.

Donkey, Fiona and Puss are suddenly at my side.

All of them are just as nude as Shrek.

Shrek flops down on his back on the bed.

Blood pools around him as his weight squeezes it out of the mattress like a sponge.

He still has me in one hand.

He skewers me on his shrock and begins using my asshole to pleasure himself.

His slimy member provides lube, but it does nothing to stop the anal stretching as it flexibly snakes its way through my intestinal tract.

Princess Fiona jumps on top of me and I silently plead to Shrek that my small dick is enough to please her majesty.

Fiona slips my dick into her snatch and it closes in around my penis.

Her ogress pussy vacuums my dick with the frenzy of a Jack in the Box customer trying to get just one little taste of his ogrely thick milkshake.

It feels as if the inside of my woody is being sucked out my pee hole.

I am now in the middle of an ogre sandwich. An Ogreo if you will.

I motorboat her giant green titties and suck the onion juice out of her nipples.

All the while with Shrek's green anaconda still slithering inside me.

I turn my head to the left and gasp for breath.

As I do, Donkey stuffs my mouth with his schlong.

It quickly finds its way deep into my esophagus.

I am finding hard to breath with Donkey's ""little Donkey"" thrusting within, yet never receding from my gaping mouth as one of my nostrils is filled with snot.

Puss in Boots nimbly climbs up the others and drags his ass and balls on my face.

Puss turns around and I see his small barbed baculum poking out from his fur.

He examines my two nose cunts and thankfully chooses the one already filled with snot to jab his boner into.

It is the greatest moment of my life.

I submit myself completely to Fairy Tale Lands finest.

The amount of movement going in on inside of me is indescribable.

I am now 33% cock.

I reach around and claw at Fiona's rump, trying to get a chance to stick my fist in the greatest woman of all time.

Then, it happened.

Shrek and Donkeys foreskin meet together in my tummy.

Their tips lightly kiss one another, right before spewing a stew of cum inflating my stomach like a water balloon.

Seconds later, I spunk into Fiona's pussy.

My eyes roll back in my head.

I am breathing furiously yet only through one nostril.

It isn't ogre yet.

I release a lengthy stream of semen as I never have before.

Donkey and Shrek still seem to be filling me with their love like a hose of sperm.

I am pumping an inhuman amount of jizz into Fiona, when I realize that it must be Shrek and Donkey whose cum is helping to give me extra virility.

Puss's saw like wang is finally running out of mucus to drill out of my nose and it begins shaving off my nose hairs.

My nose bleeds a thick pink blood-semen cocktail courtesy of Puss in Boots.

After about a minute, Shrek and Donkey's ogresm is complete.

Seconds later mine is done too.

I am more satisfied and exhausted than I have been in my entire life.

But it still isn't ogre.

I look deeply and lovingly into Fiona's green eyes as Puss and Donkey retreat from my orifices.

She spills forth from her mouth a cascade of all our juices.

It drenches my face and I squint to see Fiona, Donkey, and Puss all looking down on me with adoration.

Between gulps, I gargle ""Shrek is love. Shrek is life.""

I fall gently to sleep with Shrek's penis still moving inside of me and mine still inside Fiona.

I wake up the next morning in my mothers bed to the smell of onions and waffles.

I am alone except for the unrecognizable corpse on the floor.

Shrek and the others must have licked the cum all off because all that is left was blood and a floury substance on my hand.

I go to the kitchen to find a plate of onion waffles waiting for me.

Finally I have a family who cares for me.

After eating the feast my lovers left me, I went to my room to tell the other brogres online about my Shreksperience.

I find a note on the door.

""I was thinking about your party, and I decided that you can have a Far Far Away party after all. It is your big day and it is up to you to decide how to spend it. I will bake you your onion cake and make brownies for everyone else. Even though you have grown up into a wonderful Prince Charming, you will always be my special little boy. Love Mommy.""

Prince Charming?

PRINCE CHARMING?

copypasta,"So one day I was wearing shoes, and they were pretty comfortable. I decided they were good to walk in, so I walked in them. That wasn’t so bad, so I kept doing it for the rest of the day.

Over the next four days, my shoes got more and more comfortable, and I wondered if it would continue. I asked another person about this, and they said “No—your pair’s just being broken in. It starts off stiff but then adapts to your foot shape.”

I thought that was pretty cool. But it wouldn’t last forever, as the person said. So then I realized that the shoes would go on, but they would begin to stay the same. I wondered how I could change that.

When I got home, I googled “Things to do with shoes” so I would know how to spice it up with them. Turns out, you can tie shoelaces! I had just been using tape to keep my shoes closed around my feet. I took the tape off, and pulled off the shoes; then, I realized that they were Velcro.

I googled “What to do with Velcro shoes” but didn’t get many answers. Unfortunately, I had shoes that I couldn’t do much with. I couldn’t try out crazy knots or anything, or whip people with long laces. But! There was one thing that I wanted to try out.

When I got to a crowded place the next day, I remembered what I had decided: I would practice first. Immediately, I bent down and started applying and un-applying the straps, making some noise. People began to walk around me in a circle.

It worked!

Over the next few months, I made noise with my shoes, mastering the art of moving a crowd and making noise with Velcro.

I was ready, now. This was a pretty cool thing to do with Velcro shoes, I had to admit.

I went up to Times Square, five pairs of shoes in each hand; having mastered the art of telekinetically moving their Velcro straps, I had the power of the ancients in my hands. I threw them into their positions, and with rhythmic Velcro-snapping, I summoned it. The Lace, the Strap. The Shoe-closer.

It beckoned to me, as the people in the streets ran. It asked what I had summoned it for.

With sheer courage keeping me going, I said two words: “Louder Velcro.” The Shoe-closer nodded, and left. I knew it had fulfilled my request.

After I was no longer on national television, I made my way to a crowded street. I bent over, looking at my shoes. I knew what I wanted to do.

I ripped the strap, making a 100 dB noise, exploding all cars arounding and permanently deafening myself. I grinned.

It was time to put these shoes to good use."

copypasta,"Because First of all it takes 1 hour 24 minutes from Birmingham to London on a normal Virgin Pendolino and Voyager service. These trains have an operational limit of 125 mph, the class 390 can do up to 140 mph, which means quicker travel to London. The class 390 is limited to 125 mph because of track signaling complications. Spending money towards that would be cheaper to solve this issue to make travel around the hour mark on Pendolino services. The new hs2 trains will be travelling at around 140 mph which would take a proposed 49-50 minutes, ask yourself is it worth the hassle and 60 billion pounds just to save 10-15 minutes of journey time? The class 800 trains from Hitachi which are to roll out in 2018 will also have a top speed of 140 mph, consider that Voyager trains have will have been around for 18 years, efficiency of these trains will bring operation and maintenance costs up therefore removing these trains out of service paving way for the class 800's. Whatmore is that Birmingham new Street, Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham snow hill are within close proximity of each other, adding another station will just bring much more congestion and problems in the city centre, not to forget that building the new hs2 lines mean knocking down flats and moving around current train lines just to get this line put in. Birmingham international is another place where a stop will be put in, there is no need for it. I think the 10 minute journey time is already sufficient for travel. This 60 billion pounds can be put to better use by firstly electrifying the entire West coast. Connecting the West and East coast of England so journeys across the country do not take hours to complete and it makes journeys easier for those who have connecting trains. Hs2 train tickets will be in the hundreds when people can just save money by travelling a few moments longer. HS2 isn't worth the trouble and hassle that will be caused, there are no promises that the project will be successful, neither the promise that the line will be built with ease or without delays. As time goes on technology will improve and better trains will roll out which will have more significant advantages over the new hs2 trains. The 60 billion pounds can be used to help the things that are more important for the people of this country."

copypasta,"Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger."

There’s a reason as to why I was sick 

So I was in math class

There was this Asian

and this Asian was just all like,
“hey, i’m ding ding ping ling, i masturbate to algebra equations.”

and the teacher drew and equation on the board

the kid got so excited he- he shat his pants

there was just shit all over the place, it was just shit.

and then this asian kid was all like
“what duh hell theres da poo poo everywhere”

it smelt so bad, it- it smelt like a pakistni kid.

it smelt like south east asia.

i think asians should have a different school from the rest of us where they just jack off to each other’s equations

“Hey ping ping ting that’s a really nice equaaaaaatiooon ughgh”

They should also have another school for the black people so we don’t have to hear their duff duff music.”

I was on r/teenagers and saw a very unfortunate post about a dude whos girl did him *very* dirty. Obv i feel very bad for him and i hope he finds the one someday. But another thing comes up with this. Teenagers have no clue what love *really* is. I see young teenage couples together for 2 weeks and have sex, then break up a week later and act like it was the end of the world. I know for a fact that 99.99% of those boys just want to fuck, nothing more. Maybe the girls know that, maybe not. It is just unfortunate when girls or boys cheat on their current ""lover"" because they are young, which usually leaves them in shambles, like the post i referred to earlier. It is just sad that a lot of teens care about sex, and think thats it. Then maybe both of them regret, maybe one does, messes up relationship, yk.

This is harmful in the same way that telling a child that they are super smart and talented is harmful. If you tell a person that they are super intelligent or perfect or whatever, they will believe that and won’t try to better themselves in any way. 

When I was younger my family always told me I was super smart everyday, and I took that to heart. Turns out I’m average, and due to my parents telling me that I was smart I decided that I didn’t need to put in any extra effort in school or study for tests, etc. This resulted in my grades taking a massive dip and me losing motivation to give an effort.

Want to know if you’ve caught the Stoner Personality Trait? Let’s find out:

Common conversational topics of the typical stoner:

1) man you gotta catch my vibe
2) the government is corrupt
3) I’m so high right now
4) I’m gonna get so high later
5) lets get some food

How do you know you’ve caught the stoner personality trait?

1) any social media you have has weed in your about me section
2) you bring up getting high at least once in every conversation you have
3) you’ll only date people who shop at Zumiez 
4) ‘aesthetic’ just ‘aesthetic’
5) you eat Taco Bell at 11pm at night
6) you don’t remember getting in the car but it’s time to hot box 
7) you met all your friends through smoking with other people
8) you don’t know anything about those friends other than their first names and last 3 exs

What to do if you’ve caught the Stoner Personality Trait!;

1) just stop allowing it to be the only thing you can think of when people ask you to tell them about yourself

unpopularopinion,"Take forced representation. The big issue is, at the moment there is not enough diversity in media. This doesnt have to be with malicious intent. Actors are most times cast by type, so if you play an innocent 18 year old girl, you better look like a pocellain doll. If you, as a casting director, are never exposed to latinos, other than the „evil immigrant“ stereotype, you will never find a latino the approprite type to play a stay at home dad. So if every casting director just goes by „what feels right“, we wont be getting a lot of new diversity in the near future. 

Now there are three possibilities for increasing diversity from the view of the casting director:

1. You get to know some latinos and lose your subconcious bias.

2. You actively try to expand your personal opinion of who is what type. You try to find the stay at home dad in everyone and try to choose someone who fulfils that type more subtly.

3. You just enforce diversity by purposefully casting people of colour instead of white, conventionally beautiful people.

All three will have the same result: More diversity in movies, viewers (and with them the next generation of casting directors) gets used to latinos as stay at home dads and will cast them as such in the future.

We can agree number 1 and 2 would be ideal but they require a lot of work from the casting director to question their views over and over again. Most likely, not a lot of people are going to do that.
The easier route is to just cast poc for the cheap praise and diversity bonus thats most likely gonna earn them a lot of money. And I dont have that much of a problem with that.

If the bottom line is to have more poc on screen, it shouldnt matter for what reason this happens. I honestly prefer the people who cast an all female ghost busters cast for cash to a guy who is very pro-natural-casting and will cast a woman if he deems it appropriate but churns out one super hero movie after another. At least the people morally in the wrong are getting the job done.



The same goes for celebrities who donate for publicity. Its a shit move morally. But its better than the people who despise that and solve the problem by not donating at all. As soon as it seems an easy gain of money or attention people magically start doing these things, and if thats what it takes to get someone to do good, im fine with that."

This is not in anyway a good way to counter arguments or discussions by saying someones profile picture matters, because it really doesn't.

For example when there as big headlines of Apple when they refused to give FBI a bacdoor to their Device because it would give access to hackers. 
1. They only denied because of hackers and not because they don't want to give data to The Police. 
2. It only made public because they refued. How many tech companies accepted and we have never heard about? 

Now here's my point. 3 other chinese mobile manufacturers can still use google's Android, Intel and qualcomm's chips and everything else US technology.

Oneplus
OPPO
Xiaomi

They don't get banned because they aren't doing as well as huawei and aren't a threat to other rivals such as Apple or Samsung.

Even tough it literally says all chinese companies must obey the communist party In chinese law. All the chinese companies are as much a security threat to the People and US officials as is Huawei.

Out of the 60% left, the tournout is on average around 50%, so only 30% of the people living in Switzerland are voting. The results are often close to 50/50.

Granted, I'm no expert on the topic, but I believe that climate change will be the end of our civilisation, and soon.  


Not enough people care, or are willing to change in order to combat perhaps the single greatest threat to human society,  and I'm not talking about plastic straws or whatever, I'm talking about our biggest population centres, like China and India for example, where more carbon emissions and waste are produced than anywhere else. All the paper straws in the world wouldn't mean a thing if they didn't stop.  


Problem is I don't think, even if they wanted to, that they could do it in time. Not by themselves.  
And as radical and stupid as it sounds, I think that something drastic needs to take place.  
If not the nuclear option, then a united effort to destroy the industries and infrastructure in these countries, and others that are an issue.  


Again, granted, I'm not sure what kind of effect that might have on the economy, and I am sure that there would be many refugees that need to be dealt with.

Like most people I love a good hamburger, but since I dont want to eat meat ive been making portobello burgers, simply replacing the bur.ger with a portobello mushroom.
I usually put some pesto on the bun, some lettuce, a fried egg and maybe some onions and jalapeños.
To top it off i squeeze some Sriracha or sweet chili over it.
Its a damn tasty burger but not as good as the real thing.

When the impossible burger came out I ran to the store to pick some up. Got some fresh bread buns and all the stuff i usually use and was ready to go.
I was a bit concerned about the burgers tho, how on earth are they gonna get the texture the same as a real hamburger? When I cook it is it gonne be crunchy on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside?

But to my surprise it did all these things waaaay better then i expected! 
It looked and felt like a real burger!
So then the actual taste test...
First bite was kinda like a real burger but I instantly noticed something.
The taste...

The taste is off. It doesnt taste like a hamburger.
All the people saying you dont notice any difference and customers at Burger King could easily be fooled into thinking theyre eating a real burger youre all friggin delusional.
I dont understand how they can make it look and feel like a real hamburger but in a time where we have “Buffalo Wing flavoured patato chips” these people cant make the impossible burger taste like the real thing.

When the people at “Impossible” get this right i will be buying their burgers again, until then unfortunately ill be going back to Portobellos.

""it's a womans right to wear whatever she wants, and it's controlling to tell her otherwise""
I've seen countless times people complaining about men, telling women that they should not show their breasts and cleavage in public. And every time, the logic is ""stop controlling women"".

But it really isn't about control, some people just want the sacred part of a relationship to be sacred. Not everyone should know what goes on between people in love.

I want to clarify, I'm not saying women should go around completely covered, or that women should listen when their boyfriend/husband says to cover. I'm just saying that they have reasons for it, and they aren't just being abusive and controlling.

unpopularopinion,"Disclaimer, when it's in a culture that changing names is expected and when your husband wants it.  

There's not much these days that is specifically and only for the benefit of men.  Marriage, weddings,  and especially divorce favor women an absurd amount.   For my wedding, I basically allowed my wife to have it the way she wanted,  because it was important to her.   I spent a couple thousand bucks on an engagement ring, because it was important to her.    In my opinion,  when it's expected, when your husband wants it,  and you refuse to do it, you're being selfish and disrespectful.   I straight up told my wife (fiance at the time) that if you don't agree to change your name,  I wouldn't show up to the wedding.  And I would've ended the relationship if she hadn't agreed.   It would've been a sign that she wanted me to sacrifice for her,  but she wouldn't sacrifice for me. 

It's not expected for men to change their name,  so it's wierd when women say,  ""Well why doesnt the man just change his name to hers?""  F off with that bullshit.   It's not culturally expected.   And everything else favors women."

Maintaining the right pH level is so important to our survival that if it drops below 7.35 or rises above 7.45, the body deploys numerous buffering mechanisms—involving blood proteins, phosphate, bicarbonate, and the lungs and kidneys—in order restore the balance.
Anything that overwhelmed those buffering mechanisms and made the blood either too acidic (below 7) or too alkaline (above 7.7) would quickly result in death.

Now that sounds scary at first, especially since most of us are used to those platforms as the home of the internet. However, it's also true that there have been a lot of issues with those companies in the past and many people were unsatisfied with the way they are willing to do anything it takes to grow and make more and more money; they were considered willing to censor speech and popularize politically extreme opinions, essentially eradicating freedom on the internet.

I say it is a “defect” because something in their brain does not do what it is supposed to do, and the main natural purpose of a human is to breed, survive and raise children. And the get children part, is not something that 2 guys can do without the help of someone who can give birth.

unpopularopinion,"Usually I like to think ""Hey if it works for them, great. If they can garner the self discipline to drastically reduce carbs, awesome. Doesn't mean I have to.""

However, it's gotten to the point where if you ask for advice on the internet about how to go about setting the foundation for weight loss, almost everyone immediately screams ""KETO!!!"" or about any other low carb diet. I'm so sick of hearing about it. I have personally tried these low carb diets (yes, I genuinely tried to give it enough time and effort to actually work) and all they do is make me miserable. I get the worst fatigue I've ever experienced, I get pissed, and my anxiety explodes. I just can't physically or emotionally keep up with it or turn it into a lifestyle.

To be honest, I think diets drastically limiting or completely omitting entire macros or food groups is harmful and shouldn't be so paraded around unless a doctor specifically tells you to be on one for a health condition. I feel like these fad diets just promise a quick fix (note: I didn't say ""easy"") for weight issues and that a good amount of people will just gain the weight back once they reach their goal and start reintroducing carbs.  Carbs aren't as bad as people make them out to be. Heavily processed and simple carbs, I can see the aversion to them and they definitely should be limited. Whole grains, fruits? Your body needs them! The nutrients and fiber are far too important to be skipped.

Why is there such a superiority thing to it? You can eat healthier foods, control your portion sizes, exercise, and count calories. Maybe not as fast as with low-carb diets, but slow progress is proven to help weight maintainence in the future.
Im not a doctor, but if you aren't losing weight that way, you're either cheating somewhere or have a health concern that needs to be addressed. (Not losing weight means losing no weight whatsoever, not experiencing slow weight loss.)

If im misunderstanding anything here, please let me know and I will try to learn more about it.

TL;DR - If Keto works for you, cool, Im happt for you and glad youre in control of your health and feel good, but you don't have to shove it in everyone's face and act like you're superior because you're following some fad diet.

unpopularopinion,"This year I had a room mate who was a gamer. He was my best friend but he, like all of us was drawn to instant gratification. He spent lots of his time and money playing video games, as one does.

I once asked him If the thought he was benefited now from spending all that time and effort creating a good player in 2k, but he ignored the question and said ""its just about hangin out with the boys"". He also explained how its just one of those things to relieve stress like playing basketball or something.

My argument is that after you are done with that video game whether it is 2k or anything else, it has not done anything to improve your real life (maybe you are more skillful at the game, but your achievements dont mean shit). In other words, you are currently not more happy in this moment from all those video games you played in your past.

Here's the thing: video games might still be good to ""waste time"" but my room mate was in college, and belive me, it is easy to not have any time to waste during the semester. You can have a whole plethora of things to do on a college campus, and things that will actually improve your life! But, my room mate decided he would rather spend his time on video games, and it was frustrating as a mauf to watch. 

Now I know I currently have no empathy, because i do not play many video games right now. Trust me, i love video games, and i know what its like to be hooked on them. Its the only thing you can think about sometimes. But they still are just a distraction.

If you want to be successful at something in real life, you simply need to spend time working on it. Not just a little time, but all of your time. If its not what you actually want to do, then i suppose you will be wasting your time, and you might as well spend it on video games. But I belive if you have a mentality of i can work a little, and then have time for my video games, then you will find yourself as nothing but mediocre as you wasted a portion of your ""getting good at something in real life time""."

My thought process behind this is that them being overweight obviously has deeper reasons behind it.  If you are overweight then you have made a series of bad decisions to make yourself that way, there are no excuses.  Most of the time, people who are overweight have a different outlook on life because of it.  A lot of the times they eat away their problems or they go to food for comfort, there’s a problem with that. 

Honestly, when I’m looking for someone to date, I am not looking for the overweight person because of the underlying issues that are almost always a side effect of being overweight, not to mention the fact that their average lifespan is shorter.

unpopularopinion,"I've seen it from time to time on Reddit. When someone gets cheated on and share their story, if they even mention the idea of being angry at the person who their partner cheated on with them. People like to question why, as they didn't have anything to do with their partner committing the act. And in some cases, if not most, they're right. Perhaps, the initial outburst is just being emotional about finding out about it, especially if you catch them in the act. 

However, I do believe there's that other side. It's one thing if your partner cheats on you and the other person is completely oblivious to your existence. They didn't know, they just saw someone they thought was attractive/cool/whatever and got played just like you.  But, if that person knows about you and knows about your relationship, and still decides to follow through with hooking up with your partner, then yes, by all means, they should be blamed.

Even if you argue that your partner was gonna cheat on you period, so the other person doesn't matter. If the other party knows and doesn't back away from the situation, if not tell you about what's going on. Then they are guilty for essentially encouraging the cheater to cheat."

The other thing no one talks about is why there’s high birth rate. This high birth rate is caused by instability in the region. If your kids die from disease/health/lack of supplies, you’re going to have more children to cover this. Now with modern technology advancements, these high birthright for survival cultures are temporarily obsolete.

I don't care if you assume my gender, but I think it's really insensitive to assume that the most important part of everyone's identity is their gender.

America has tons of that going around. You escaped from your country because of it being war torn? America, if given the chance, would want you to go to war if it finds an excuse to. You escaped from your country because of it being filled with criminals? America has plenty of that too.

America is not everything. The way I can describe America is this - we, the American people, are held under hostage by our government. What I mean with that, is that our freedoms, health, rights .etc are all tied by the mighty fucking dollar. Money is our language here. You are no different when you are under our system and that's nothing to be proud of. In fact, the U.S Government probably sees you as an asset for votes, for taxes and for whatever else it can sap from you. Just like it sees the rest of us as.

I'm just tired of foreigners going all parading about America when I'd like to think they're mostly saying that based on first impressions and minimal living. Sometimes, they're parading their newfound patriotism because of them getting a leg up over a born American but that's mostly in ties to the illegal immigrant side, mostly.

And we ARE allowed to bash our own country, thank you very much, that's one of the foundations of our freedom of speech."

unpopularopinion,"When a company like EA, Activision, or Rockstar releases a game for $60, they have an obligation to provide a finished product. I have no sympathy for the fact that video games 20 years ago were 60 dollars and prices haven’t risen with inflation. Neither have wages and video game technology is a lot more older now. Don’t tell me these companies have no idea how to develop video games after 20+ years of experience producing games. 

Don’t tell me it’s not totally possible to have animators in Asia do the muscles of a game for way cheaper. When a major game company sells a game for $60, that’s plenty of money to fund their video game development. On day one before GTA V DLC, at $60 rockstar was able to make 100s of millions of dollars in a couple days. I know some games are flops like Fallout 76, but that’s because of terrible game making with bad DLC.

Video game developers should not try to sell games for $100 or even $70. I don’t think they should raise prices for the next 10 years. Then in 2030 maybe make games $69.99 at launch. 

We as gamers are enabling developers to release half baked glitchy games at full price, then expect us to pay to win. DLC pay to win is ridiculous, making shark cards $100 just to enjoy online is ridiculous. All those fortnite skins for $100s of dollars is also silly.

Game developers should make a game based on merit, no DLC, only mods will get you stuff without hard work. 

I miss games like Little Big Planet, COD4, Donkey Kong Country, Mario, where winning the game was based on merit, not DLC and the games weren’t glitchy for their time.

unpopularopinion,"Disclaimer: I understand there are good and bad seeds, this isn’t to say that every single person believer is a hypocrite, this is simply my opinion based on the great majority I’ve noticed over the years. 

I’m an atheist and, as an atheist, I am persecuted, judged and ostracized, even though, as an atheist, I appreciate all living creatures even more than the average person since death is the end. The looks I get when I tell someone I’m an atheist is equivalent to telling someone I strangled my cat to death, sheer shock. Why? It doesn’t change that I’m still a good person who is nonjudgmental, believes in equality and cherishes life, I just happen to also cherish science. I feed homeless cats, I give my left over crackers to birds, I’ll shoo an ant out of my house instead of stepping on it, i care more about others than I do of myself, but I am also an atheist. 

Meanwhile, there have been countless acts of cruelty, torture, genocide, wars and murders committed for the sake of religion. The Bible is littered with despicable acts, many of which were by god himself, but the book serves as a way to justify these acts for the sake of religion. Religion has taught people to hate and has turned people against each other by excluding, demonizing and persecuting anyone different than themselves when religion was only created to account for the parts of the world we couldn’t explain, but we have science now, we don’t have to make up fairy tales about how the earth was created, we have scientific evidence and can logically devise how it was created, and it wasn’t by magic. 

Murderers, rapists, gang members, drug dealers. These are just some of the people who preach about religion yet participate in horrific crimes, but believing in god or finding religion somehow lessens their cynical crimes and makes them “more human.” I honestly have no idea how anyone could believe in a magical creation who is omnipotent and uses miracles to create something out of nothing, any more than someone can believe in the Easter bunny, Santa Clause or the tooth fairy. However, I understand  why. Religion is a source of comfort because life, and death, are a lot more terrifying knowing that you simply cease to exist and that death is the end. Honestly, it’s scary to me too, it terrifies me, not existing, losing my consciousness of being alive. I want to believe and go back to that place of blind ignorance where I did not fear death because there was an afterlife, but I just can’t. 

But the thing is, I’m not all up in your face bashing religion, atheists seldom do this because atheists are, for the most part, science driven. Part of being a science oriented person is that we constantly seek the truth, what’s really going on. In doing that, we like debate, we like to hear others opinions because we want to be proven wrong. Every science-minded person is constantly seeking to disprove science because we want the real answer, not the one we want to be real. On the other hand, try speaking to a believer about how their beliefs can be scientifically disproved, you won’t get very far.  Based on the atheist vs believer debates I’ve seen on YouTube, you’ll be wasting your breath. They won’t listen, they interrupt you literally every time you try to speak, for every piece of solid, physical evidence you give them, they find some way to discredit the evidence by citing some remote occurrence where science was wrong, but yet refusing to acknowledge the overwhelming number of times that it hasn’t been. Other popular responses include repeating themselves over and over for lack of additional evidence on their part or becoming defensive and mocking the physical evidence. Why don’t believers promote education, debate, outsiders? I believe it is because their particular beliefs, whatever they may be, literally contradict everything around them, including other religions, and this raises doubt. 

I do not personally debate with believers because it is like trying to teach quantum mechanics to a child and, unless they are open minded (which I have found the majority are not open minded hence the hostility towards any questioning of their beliefs), they are hardheaded and stubborn and they won’t listen to a word you say anyways because they already have their minds made up. 

Me? I respect everyone’s beliefs and opinions. If people want to believe in a magical, omnipotent being that was quoted in a book written over 2,000 years ago and that has been translated and reconstructed how many times, over scientific evidence, that’s fine. I understand why you want to believe and it’s your life, but don’t persecute me, constantly make me feel like I need to hide the fact that I’m an atheist because people will look at me different and treat me different because, in their eyes, I’m probably some savage heathen or the devil himself just for not believing. Don’t judge me or talk about me behind my back at work or avoid eye contact with me in the halls like you’re so superior to me because I won’t acknowledge that your fantasy world exists, or act like you’re someone terrified of me now, like I’m the office serial killer because believers have no room to talk because of the horrific things done in the name of religion when all I want to do is just read a textbook."

Stop short circuits? No because something needs to be entered in there for current to flow.

Save your hand from being electrocuted as you plug it? Plugs are tipped with non conductible material so energy can't flow through the pins that are exposed while plugging in. Even if the electricity did arc, as long as you're not somehow holding the plug with your fingers touching the pins or something, you should be fine.

unpopularopinion,"When anyone thinks about a man wearing make-up, we immediately think of James Charles, Jeffree Star, basically gay man who try to make themselves more feminine.

That's what I thought so initially, but, recently, I've come across a male influencer who uses make up to make himself look more manly and, essentially, more polished. He looked stunning and you could tell he was completely comfortable wearing make-up.

Just think about the benefits: no more visible eye bags, you'll look more fresh, more awake, like you had a good night's sleep, you could cover redness, acne and pigmentation. The only downside would be that it takes up a bit of time. 

Men with fragile masculinity would just have to live with the fact that they could look better, but choose not to."
unpopularopinion,I’ve always been a huge anime/manga fan. I learned to read through manga. I’ve also played video games since before I can remember. Lately I’ve noticed a sense of superiority amongst the gaming/anime community that really rubs me the wrong way. The majority of my friends are gamers and love anime just like I do. Recently I brought a close friend of mine around them who I played football with and I got the sense that they were looking down on him. Afterward when he left they told me that he seemed like a “douche and like somewhat of a dunce”. This was after one conversation in which he stated he didn’t play video games. The anime community gets trashed all the time for being nerds and weird in general and the fact that those same people were looking down on someone for being different then they were had me thinking about possibly finding a new group of friends. There are just as many dumb repugnant people in the gaming community as there are in any community. I don’t know where along the way anime and gaming became associated with intelligence but the two are not synonymous. People act like watching anime is on the same level as studying nuclear physics and wear it as a badge of pride.

Not to mention it shows you have terrible self control and decision making skills which is terrible for a child to grow up with a parent like that.

Skip to the end for the actual opinion, the following text is just the reasoning for the opinion.
My local (Europes biggest and newest) library opened last december here, in Finland. I noticed straight away that the toilets had no gender signs, which made everyone wanting to do their deeds visibly confused. So, when i was in urgent need to take a dump, i just entered one of the toilets and noticed two teen girls in the waiting to get to the toilet, and they looked at me like i (20M) was a pervert and they were visibly uncomfortable, as was I. 
I left the toilet and went to the inva toilet instead since i was clearly making them uncomfortable. 
Also, one time i was inside the toilets and heard about 3 girls outside my stall, which made me very uncomfortable since i didnt want an awkward moment when i exited the stall, so i just waited for like 15min for them to use the stall next to mine (there are 2 toilet stalls in one bathroom). 
==OPINION==

So, my point is that because the reason there are unisex toilets is so that tr4ns people wouldnt feel awkward in the opposite sex toilet, but here only about 0,7% of the population is tr4nsgender, and this is the thing that pisses me off, the fact that all the other 99,3% of the people feel uncomfortable using unisex toilets when it only helps slightly 0,7% of the people. I  dont mind if a  tr4ns man uses the male toilet, but the fact that EVERYONE has to use the ""tr4ns toilets"" is just ridiculous."

unpopularopinion,"I’ve been to numerous productions, and the only one I’ve enjoyed is The Book of Mormon. Which to me was entirely unique in its approach. 

The rest are difficult to follow through song. In the same way action movies can suffer from action fatigue, I believe this to be true for singing. 

The production and acting quality is largely sub par versus the vast majority of movies. Presumably due to constraints on the actors commitment requirements and budget. 

Whilst I admire the actors and singing ability compared to my own, they are unable to compare in almost all cases to films produced with an often incredible budget. 

The live element adds nothing for me at all. The ability to capture the emotion in a story is lost in the live nature and fixed angle of viewing. 

The interval is a nuisance. 

The seating is often far more cramped, and the layout worse for viewing the performance, even in the Royal Circle. 

The final straw is the cost. 2 Cinema tickets are say $20, I recently paid $150 for 2 tickets to Hamilton which was not on a day or time of my convenience.

So ultimately, the theatre is inferior to the cinema in all aspects.

I know there were scenes we wanted to have (Bran and Tyrion’s conversation in Winterfell, the aftermath of Jon’s betrayal, etc.) but the amount of negativity directed at something that I’ve personally loved for 10+ years makes me sad. 

I loved the way the show wrapped up and the parts that weren’t shown explicitly I like to try and use my imagination to fill in. Granted this is a skill that I’ve put to use most my life, I usually imagine what happens to characters I’ve fallen in love with after the ends of book series and really good television series/movies. As well as gaps in plot ( which many many books / tv series / movies have )

The last season of GoT may not have been perfect, but it was still one of the best tv series I’ve had the privilege to enjoy. And I worry that the verbal abuse the writers and others involved are being subjected to will make others think twice about taking risks when creating art. 

Because that’s what Game of Thrones is art, and art isn’t meant to be immediately understood at face value, and not everyone will get the same meaning out of it, sometimes you have to challenge yourself to see the best in a piece of art but once you do you will appreciate it far more than just agreeing with the braying jackass beside you calling it trash.

I ask anyone who reads this post and loved the first seasons or books to go back in and think about the scenes that your unhappy with or the outcomes you disagree with and realize there were many of those throughout the series, they just didn’t get amplified in the echo chamber of hate the internet has become. And try to see the significance and complexity of what happened."

In California, taxpayer funded benefits like welfare, food stamps and WIC are no longer issued as paper currency but rather onto pre-loaded debit cards that the user can customize with pictures and that look like any other debit card. I know this lowers the cost of the program because the paper is more expensive to produce and distribute but it also lowers the social stigma of using them at the checkout line and that leads to longer periods of use. In fact one of the reasons the program was changed is specifically to lower the feeling of shame by users who felt they were being judged by others when using the benefits.

To me this is not only ok but appropriate. These programs were meant to be temporary and removing any negative side effects of using them is inherently bad. 

All of those programs should be issued in such a way where they are visibly obvious as well as completely unable to transfer use to another person. They should be tied to the person’s driver’s license or ID card and unable to work with another ID card, they should be only good for the products for which they were intended (food, clothing, household items, medics care, education, etc) and unusable at places like liquor stores, fast food restaurants, racetracks, disneyland, etc.

unpopularopinion,"""Homophobia"" is considered bad nowadays. But its actually healthy. When I say ""homophobia"" I mean being grossed out by men having sex with men and avoiding it. I don't mean going around beating the shit out of men for being gay or murdering them.

Being grossed out by gays prevents disease because MSM have much higher STD rates than the general population. The HIV-AIDS rates among MSM in the USA may be 10-20% or higher. Meaning a 1/10, 1/5 or 1/4 of them have HIV. They make up 2% of the population but more than half of new HIV infections. 

Homophobia, being disgusted by MSM means avoiding sex with other men. And that, in turn, means not catching all kinds of diseases that are common among them.

Gay sex is easy to get in big western cities. It's legal. Police will harass and arrest a 'john' paying a female hooker for sex before they arrest MSM having unprotected anal sex with each other in a bathhouse. And some gay men are sexually aggressive. So ""homophobia"" (being disgusted by the shit), not the law or lack of access, is the main barrier stopping someone like me from fucking other men. And not fucking other men, in turn, reduces my risk of catching the diseases that are common among MSM.

Thereore my homophobia is healthy and has been very beneficial for me, no matter what the SJWs say."

I never knew American high schools were that cruel towards anyone who was seen as an outsider, I never had a clue. I was pretty shocked to see the sort of atmosphere at their school in the years leading up to the attack.

No, I don't make excuses for them, what they did was horrific and should not be condoned. But fact remains, these two guys were horrifically and relentlessly tormented, taunted, harrassed for years, both heavily medicated, both had a wide variety of pretty severe issues and both their autopsies showed signs of self-harm. 

Does this excuse their behavior in any way, shape or form? No, not at all. But with the way they were treated, they were bound to snap at some point. And if only they took their rage out on the people that actually tormented them instead of targetting their victims at random, I would have even understood why they did it. However the thing turned into a sadistic powertrip. Shootings are never okay. But I don't believe for one minute they would have done what they did if they had been treated like actual human beings by their peers and not abused like dogs."

By claiming to know something that the majority of the people don't, they feel like they belong to an elitist group who only they know the truth, thus boosting their sense of self worth and self esteem. They think everyone else are brainless sheep for trusting the government, and in contrast, that makes antivaxxers highly intelligent because they are able to ""follow the money of big pharma"" and ""follow the research that the government is censoring"" and distinguish the ""truth"" behind vaccines from lies that the government feeds. Being in this movement also gives antivaxxers a sense of purpose and duty in life, as they attempt to ""combat the corrupt government and scientific community"" to save people from vaccines.


The reason why they will never change despite the mounds of evidence against what they believe in is because if they admit that they are wrong, then they are forced to accept the fact that they are not special, they are not intelligent, and they serve no real purpose in this world. They are forced to accept that they are below average when it comes to education and have to find meaning in life elsewhere besides campaigning against the government and freeing the sheep from the brainwashing propaganda of science and big pharma."

In fact, I've never seen someone driving a manual back into another vehicle because they were on an incline.

Neat, glad you know how to do that, but unless you buy a typewriter, *it doesn't matter.*

You don't get better gas mileage and really the only argument I've heard in their defense is that they're more fun to drive. That very well may be true, *but it doesn't make you a better driver*, in fact I'd be curious to see if there's been any studies on this. I imagine because you're having to do slightly more than someone in an automatic, there's a case for them actually being worse drivers, the same way they say smoking or eating while driving distracts you.

But the company that produces Lego, The Lego Group ... they suck ass. For the following reasons:

- They charge an extortionate amount for shit sets. This is barring almost all but the most wealthy from buying their sets. For what is essentially toys, their kits cost in to the multiple hundreds. The joy, creativity and fun that can be had with them is locked down to pretty much only those that can afford them.

- Lack of creativity. For a company that prides itself on driving creativity, they sure have none themselves. Literally every set they sell now is another IP, Star Wars, Marvel etc. All featured with multiple unique components stamped with a few lego connectors. Long gone are the amazing models that would come with 1-5 unique parts max, which were pretty exchangeable, the rest was made of the core bricks. Now look at this [shit](https://shop.lego.com/en-GB/product/Toy-Story-4-RV-Vacation-10769). £30 for what looks like something you use to get out of a Happy meal.

unpopularopinion,"Unless it is a hazard to the child or people around them (such as not vaccinating your kids), people need to stay out of other people’s business when it comes to parenting. The parents’ job is to make the best decision for their child based off of their beliefs and morals, and what is safest for their child, until the kid is old enough to choose for themselves.

I’m so sick of people saying “the kid couldn’t consent.” By that logic, a parent shouldn’t make ANY decisions for their child. They shouldn’t teach them to walk because maybe they don’t want to walk. They shouldn’t teach them English because they couldn’t consent to learning English. Maybe they wanted to learn Spanish instead. They shouldn’t put them in school because maybe they didn’t want to learn anything. They shouldn’t teach them manners because maybe they don’t want to be a nice person.

It is literally the parents job and duty to their child to make the best, well informed, and most moral decisions for their child.

Also, an auto mod has been deleting my post so I'm trying to find a work around in wording, I think you will all know what I mean though.

Women losing their bodily autonomy would bring them closer to equality with men in our society, as men have no bodily autonomy. Men must sign up for the draft or go to prison, men regularly have their genitals mutilated as babies, and men have no right to a termination.

What I mean by this last statement is financial termination. When two people create a life the woman has the right to kill it if she doesn't want it. However, the man has no right. If he doesnt want the kid he is still forced to pay child support at gunpoint by the government. You are essentially made a slave to this woman and, therefor, have no bodily autonomy.

We receive a lot of free labor from abroad to fill in shortages in the many fields that Americans are either unqualified for or are unwilling to work in. Immigrants as a whole commit less crime than natives in the US, even among illegal immigrants. The border itself exacerbates the humanitarian crisis. It's unfair that being born in a rich country gives you access to all the best opportunities, whilst being born in a poor one more than likely means you will be stuck in relative poverty for the rest of your life. By lifting these restrictions, we negate the need for foreign aid and will receive valuable workers in return, who can better maximize their productivity by living in a richer country.

&amp;#x200B;

Opponents of unlimited immigration often fall victim to the [lump of labor fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy) They believe that by bringing in more migrants we are somehow depriving the native citizens of this country, when in reality all but the most unskilled workers (Those without a highschool diploma) will see a wage decrease. And even then, the effect is rather small and can be mitigated through social programs.

Another teacher would talk about the virtues of age gaps in relationships and rave about his much younger wife, and how it was so cool being a late-in-life dad, and how hot his wife was and how cool he was for being married to her 32-year old self as a man in his early sixties... also deeply inappropriate.

Oh and there was one teacher who got extremely passionate about everyone's right to marry and who was very openly hostile towards organized religion. This woman was the chillest among those three teachers I named and I agreed a lot with her views but it was still deeply unprofessional the way she conducted herself, looking back. Especially because she would argue with some of my more religious classmates and obviously, being a well-educted woman in her late thirties, would destroy them and humiliate them in the process.

I happen to be friends with a girl I have known almost my entire life. From around elementary school I was always somewhat jealous of how pretty she was. Even if I did get better grades, it really didn’t matter because I always thought she was better than me just because she was pretty. Fast forward to middle and high school and she naturally was the girl every guy had a crush on. I only got asked to a dance once in my entire four years of HS. Meanwhile she averaged 3 or 4 ‘prom-prosals’ every year. 

I didn’t really start to see the downsides until we got to college. Guys would come up to us while we were studying or eating somewhere and make incredibly gross passes at her. I knew that even though she was used to it, she was still bothered by many of the comments. 

Then a few times during our sophomore year she called me in the middle of the night in an absolute panic. Each time a guy had been following her and either begging or threatening her. Since then she’s actually been afraid of going anywhere alone at night.

Let's say there is a father watching over a trial of the guy who molested his little girl. The judge declares the man guilty and while he's been taken away the father calls him a disgusting P**i. I don't think he's being racist ... I mean, he could but you can't be sure without talking to him.

unpopularopinion,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE VOTING OR COMMENTING.

I'm black, and I would never discriminate against anyone based on their race, age, sexuality, etc. I have a good chunk of white friends, but I make sure that they understand why blacks and Natives complain about the past and why they shouldn't feel awkward for feeling guilty. I'm not saying they *should* feel guilty, I'm just saying it's a natural response, and that if they can acknowledge the past and present, they have nothing to feel guilty about. Just as they can't take credit for their ancestors' accomplishments, they shouldn't have to take credit for their ancestors' sins.

Let's be completely honest; blacks and Natives were severely oppressed for a looooooooooooong time, especially blacks. Even after slavery ended, we still went through a century of racial segregation and segregation only ended around 50 years ago.

Obviously racism is less tolerated nowadays and we've even had a black president. I'd even go as far to say that racism is pretty dead, and things are normal nowadays.

But what white people completely ignore in these discussions is the **aftermath**. If you've ever been to a black suburb or an Indian reservation, you'll know what I mean. Poverty, crime, and bare opportunities are the usual in black suburbs, and as for Indian reservations, they also suffer from poverty. But their genetic makeup makes them four to five times more susceptible to heart disease and diabetes from the American diet. Native Americans were very used to a specific diet that they can no longer grow, as the government of the time relegated them to land that isn't very convenient.

It just sucks, and it doesn't help that white people like to ignore it and blame **US** for it. As if we chose to be conquered and oppressed for hundreds of years, which put us in the placements we are now."

But that’s the thing; they suck in a lot of comedy movies I know, and it’s more obnoxious than funny. It’s especially common in almost every “girls’ night out” kind of film. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for funny movies that also have themes of empowerment and independence if done correctly. Again though, most of the time it isn’t.

True comedy is all about wit. Delivery. Quickness. Sarcasm. A vagina joke every two minutes barely hits any of these points, much less all of them. I hope the comedy genre can start making a turnaround."

For those of you who say such people should classify themselves a conscientious objectors, the requirements for that are pretty high. You have to prove to a board that you've objected to all war for moral reasons, not political, and not restricted to the current war for some time before the draft. The burden of proof is too high. 

I also disagree with the concept of a draft. There is plenty of literature on how it's comparable to slavery and how conscripted soldiers don't perform well. This is probably a popular opinion though but it explains the title a bit."

unpopularopinion,"I am personally a pro-choice person and I think that the heartbeat bills, especially without exclusions for rape and incest, are radical. However, I also think that the common arguments given in favor of abortion are bad and do nothing to facilitate a fruitful discussion. Before you downvote this unpopular opinion to oblivion, please take the time to read my analysis and provided sources below.

1) ""It is a woman's body, so it is a woman's choice."" - This statement can be applied to any pregnancy, including the ones in the third trimester. Since late-term abortions are essentially equivalent to infanticide and [rejected by society](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx), such a general argument which can be used to justify them, is ultimately weak.

2) ""Men should not pass bills regarding women's well being."" - This argument suggests that if the voters have not elected women among their legislators, the legislators should not be allowed to do their job when it comes to women's health issues. Also, [men and women have almost identical views on abortion](https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us05222019_usch361.pdf/https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us05222019_usch361.pdf/).

3) ""Abortion bans are a tyranny of the few over the many."" - Actually, about [half of all Americans support Heartbeat bills](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/443879-poll-majority-of-voters-think-6-week-abortion-bans-arent-too), if there are exclusions in case of rape and incest. Only about [1/3 of Americans is in favor of abortions after the first trimester](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx). 

4) ""People should not argue against abortion unless they adopt children."" - I do not need to host a felon in my house if I am against the death penalty. I do not need to adopt a child if I am against murdering it. Also, [religious people are much more likely to adopt children](https://adoption.org/who-adopts-the-most) anyway."

I workout, I do my job, I play my games, I do my hobbies, I occasionally date, if I like gotta reach a high place just pull a stool (I'm not even that short that I need a stool to reach standard cabinets).  

You know the only challenge when you're short? People. Who keep bringing it up and treat you on the basis of one physical trait. When I was a wee lad in school I was pretty much bullied and never taken seriously for being short. Once you grow up you realise it doesn't matter at all.   

Short people aren't 'insecure' about their height because it doesn't really stop them from doing what they want. They are just not in the mood to mention it because it's fucking annoying and have probably been bullied by Burj Khalifa looking ass mfs back in school.

unpopularopinion,"So I've been browsing the relationship advice sub, and I've seen a few posts that equate catching a partner masturbating or watching porn with cheating. I think this is a super unhealthy and toxic expectation in a relationship. 

It's one thing if YOU don't enjoy porn or masturbation. Different strokes (or not) for different folks. But when people freak out about their S.O jerking off and watching porn and accuse them of cheating, the only thing you're accomplishing is making your partner sexually frustrated and miserable. It's perfectly normal and natural to masturbate! It's a completely unreasonable expectation that someone's sexual needs can be fully met by their S.O all the time. That's SO MUCH pressure to put on a relationship. Masturbation can be such a fun and sexy part of a relationship and those toxic ass controling attitudes RUIN IT. 

 And further more, why the hell do some people feel the need to control what their partner is doing with their genitals? Do you also want to control when they take a shit? 

Tl:;dr: thinking masturbation/porn is cheating is dumb and you need a better understanding of relationships and human sexuality."

The main reason why these people go to the shisha lounge is to take a damn picture to post on Instagram/snapchat and they look so stupid. It always made them less attractive and me not wanting to hang out with them that much anymore. Like really, what's the point of going to a shisha bar?

unpopularopinion,"Not in a moral sense, of course, I believe that countries SHOULD be divided over ethnic/geographic/linguistic lines but with the way modern events have played out (i.e Palestine, Crimea, ISIS' capture of large parts of Iraq+Syria, Tibet stand out as the hot button issues of this decade) it seems that countries are unwilling to accept changes in borders or incorporation of new land via military force as ""legal"" despite the fact that for the majority of humans living in the western and northern hemispheres, their countries borders were shaped by warfare until stabilizing in the 1945-1993 era when the UN was created. 

&amp;#x200B;

Countries are still heavily divided among ethnic groups and especially in places like Europe there are a multitude of secessionist movements in several countries because we recognize the legal borders of a country as the borders that were established (mostly) through warfare during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century yet when a country that is not geopolitically aligned with us does it now in the 21st century, it's immediately criticized as an illegal act. Ideally it would be best for land to be traded on mutual terms, but right now this only usually happens to fix messy borders with multiple enclaves/exclaves.

&amp;#x200B;

While it is morally abhorrent for a country to force themselves onto another people group whom do not wish to be governed by said country, the reality of the situation is that:  


If you administer and govern a land, no matter how ""illegal"" it is, you still own that land. The failure of a country to protect it's land (whether through military force, or alliances) effectively means it has seceded it's land to the aggressing country and failed the people who live in the seized land.

unpopularopinion,"Look, I get it that it's an easy and perhaps even instinctual thing to do. Your bill is $38, so just tip $6 because 3×2=6. But that's a buck fifty you shorted someone. Even if you're not into breaking down change, it's still a dollar short rounded down. It adds up quick when 20 people do this. 

I get it that it's your right to not tip %20 or whatever based on quality of service. But when someone does meet your standard of service, and takes the time to do the small things for you (bring you that 3rd lemon wedge or whatever) and you cannot even be bothered to do grade school math, you're a POS and likely a massive hypocrite. It's cognitive indolence at worse and mental gymnastics to save a buck at best (don't go out to eat then!)

Yes, tipping culture is inherently flawed and its bullshit for an employer to pass the bill onto you for someone else's living wage, but by going out to restaurant in the first place you're choosing to engage that cultural standard and it's implications are on you. When you do, someone is depending on you, and more often than not trying there best to earn it. Rounding down with good service is just plain trashy.

How would you feel if you're employer stiffed you on a minor technicality, mental indifference, or objection to a universal standard after you did your best? I know this happens, and people loathe it, but next time you're out to eat remember you're a minor CEO in someone's life and they likely dont deserve that shaft anymore than you do.

Sure very small bills might just warrant a round down, but $10 or $20+ is a solid dick move. Especially when the tab is in excess of $100. Rounding down HURTS.

I guess this whole dilemma is America in a nutshell. Golden rule circling the toilet bowl in the name of a dollar.

Sorry for the rant, and yes, full disclosure I'm obviously a server. It'd be easy to say then I clearly suck at my job. Maybe I do, but I have been in the industry a long time in many different roles around many, many, servers and can tell you rounding down is a plague. I've seen people walk away thrilled with the service and quality of food, say kind things, offer handshakes, the works, a thousand times, only for the server to pick up there tab and get stiffed $5 thanks to the all too casual round down.

At the same time, I also think that communism sucks ass, and shouldn't be attempted. It's possible for me to be on the right without going to the extreme. That does not make me a centrist. This isn't some binary choice where you have to choose between far right or far left. 

A centrist is someone who is flat in the middle of the political spectrum. I'm not. I'm on the right, but since I don't take an extreme point of view, I'm somehow called a centrist (Which isn't inherently a bad thing, but that's a topic for another time).

They have to deal with the knowledge that the whole country could be harmed and their names will be hated forever.

And they put up with ceaseless criticism. With thousands of people constantly drawing mocking cartoons of them, writing about how much they hate them, and criticising their looks, their emotions or lack of emotions, and everything they do. Particularly in our  age that's quick to take offence (on both the left and right), they put up with an endless stream of insults. That's an admirable tenacity.

And yet some people(not at my job} come to tell me I'm a bad employee, that I should be doing whatever they say without question, that they're paying me, etc, etc, etc.

I mean what is this bullshit that I have to care now. Why? It's an exchange after all, in this case, my time for their knowledge and money. I intend to start my business once I feel I have acquired the skills to do so and I could not give less of a shit about any company's goals. It's not my company, the personal benefit I'm seeing is miniscule compared to what the owners are seeing. Even if they did give a shit, which they don't, why should I behave any differently than they would if they had to cut costs? If they had to they would axe me and anyone else that hurts ""the bottom line"".

unpopularopinion,"I'm sure this is where the dermatologists are going to have an aneurism and point put that any tan is bad for you. 

Well guess what, we aren't vampires. People are going to go outside and have direct contact with sunlight. We won't be living our whole lives avoiding any and all ultraviolet radiation. In fact, having exposure to sunlight is better than no exposure as it helps with synthesizing vitamin D 

When winter ends and people start shedding our clothes and reveal our past white bodies, many of us get burnt the first day out. Sometimes regardless of how much sunscreen we spray and lather on. But guess what? By the end of the summer I'm guessing you can withstand the same amount of sunlight as the first day without so much as a red spot. All because of a little healthy tanning. Small sessions spread out through the season when you would have been getting sunlight anyways and voila! You now have a baseline of melanin against moderate sun. 

Now I'm not advocating for long periods of leisurely tanning, but enough exposure to get that slight buildup of melanin."
unpopularopinion,"It's kind of hard to make a well written post for this subject, so I'll just organize the main points. (I live in the USA so I'm referring to the typical American holidays.

-First off, the religious holidays are not going to be criticized (christmas, easter, hannukah, etc.) because I am an atheist and I view all religious activity as bullshit, so by default they get excluded since they would get an unfair bias.

-I will also not criticize the REASONS of specific holidays, because people celebrate them all for different reasons, I'm simply hating on their sole existence. 

-The existence of holidays of any kind are pointless. Why celebrate them on a specific day for only 1 day out of the year? Why do we completely change our mindsets and celebrate various holidays just for the hell of it? Usually, it's a reason to go visit your family or friends, and then back to normal any other normal day? Why can't we just do these things without having a holiday to back that reason up?

-A word for you white collar workers out there.. Why bitch and moan about not having a certain holiday off, or fighting each other deciding who has to work those days? Just fucking work cause you get paid just like any other day! That's what days off are for!

-Oh dear, not those bullshit third-tier ""holidays"" like national hot dog day or some shit. I'm not even gonna get into that

-One final thing, and you usually see this on more specific holidays that only a certain demographic would care for. Take Valentine's day for example. If the only girlfriend you've ever had was your hand, you're damn right that person is gonna feel some deep sadness reminder come that time every year. Other examples, mothers or fathers day if you don't have those respective people in your life, veteran's day if all your war brothers are dead, new years eve if you don't have any friends to celebrate with, the list goes on.

-And one more less important point, just to stir up some fun, why is mother's day infinitely more special then father's day? Can't wait for my yearly necktie and wrench set every year when I have kids!"
unpopularopinion,"I remember reading about a 17 year old who was found strangled in his car. He was last seen at a Denny's with three nerds, who were described as looking nerdy ie glasses, khakis, and they were skinny guys.

The nerds got the 17 year old victim to drive to an isolated location. Then, for unknown reasons, they turned on him all at once. They then started beating the 17 year old senseless until he was down on the ground. Then one of the nerds grabbed his head and slowly forced it into his lap, where he got the victim into a scissor hold, and kept squeezing his throat until his neck broke and he died of asphyxiation.

I have a nerd friend (lets call him Joe) who matches the stereotypical nerd description and I brought this up with him. He said he did not feel sorry for the victim since he must of provoked those nerds and he was basically blaming the victim so I just repeatedly punched him in his thighs out of anger."

3) some other douchebag pops up out of nowhere, I kill him, amazingly.

The consequences are much greater than this though. Without government's minimum wage, unemployment would fall rapidly, and the natural minimum wage price would appear (supply and demand of labor). This natural minimum wage will rise faster than otherwise (demand for labor will grow faster than it does now), as the economy would be in a much higher productivity level."

unpopularopinion,"TL:DR at bottom

We all know what a horoscope is. It is in practically every form of media and is unfortunately taken seriously by dinguses.

Astrology being stupid is not an unpopular opinion ofcourse, every sane person knows that.

The stars are millions of light years away, so they do not care about us or our star signs or air symbols. All that is BS made by people who think the universe owes them something. The universe is indifferent to how we perceive it, so it is arrogant and foolish to think that we can make up whatever we want and pretend it is true.  

I hope that you the reader are cognizant if this, but that is not what i want to talk about today.

I think that horoscopes are immoral too.

I use immoral loosely. Though it is true believeing in false information and spreading that to others is a bad thing, that is not what i mean. I mean that Astrology's existance is immoral, but ""PG"" immoral.

I define discrimination as when you make an irrational judgement on someone based on a trait of theirs not connected to that judgement. So for example, treating someone differently or being biased against them because of their sex, age, race or sexuality etc. These traits do not reflect a person's character in anyway, so we view these acts as immoral. Even if the judgement is positive, e.g. you are black therefore you have a big junk (i am living proof this is false), it is still wrong.

Now imagine this. Substitute all the silly names of a horoscope such as ""Scorpion, Cancer, Pisces etc"" with a person's skin colour.

""Blacks have problems dating, they will go through a tough time in their life because they are black.""

See? That sounds terrible right?

And just like making claims about someone based on their race is discrimination, making statements about a person based solely on their date of birth is equally incorrigible.

Ofcourse you might be thinking ""Doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Plus the horoscopes just say crap that apply to everyone and pretent to be revealed knowledge by being vague."" That is true. However i value consistency more so than what is  important or how something is treated.

If we admit discrimination is wrong, we must also admit that horoscopes employ discrimination too.

I do not think horoscopes should be banned or anything but i want people to acknowledge they are dumb and they are also discrimination.


TL:DR: A horoscope makes a judgement based on a persons date of birth. Although it is not a big problem, it is logically no different to judging someone based on their race.

Oh. Plus I am a Libra."
unpopularopinion,"I get where people come from saying it’s mutilation, but as someone who was circumcised at birth, I’m kinda glad. For one, my girlfriend says she likes the look of circumcised penises better and uncircumcised ones look gross; two, I don’t have to worry about dick cheese and all that gross stuff under my foreskin, and lastly I don’t remember the pain of it like I would if I were to make the decision to have it done later in life. People say, “But your penis is more sensitive if you’re uncircumcised,” and that may be the case but sex is pretty great for me now so I don’t really care if my hooded snake is hoodless."
unpopularopinion,"Maybe you prefer the term “focused child discipline.” Fine. Hitting children after acts of defiance and disrespect is crucial in human development and creates necessary boundaries into the teenage and early adult phases of life. 

Most asshole adults I’ve known well enough to ask have told me that they were never struck as a child. Seems like a common thread of missed opportunity. 

Before I get the outrage crowd involved in telling me how horrific child abuse is, you should probably focus on the first word of the title instead. I’m not talking about black eyes and knock outs. I’m merely saying a firm spanking with proper explanation ensures a community of future adults who act right."

Here are the pluses and minuses of having  *Explosive diarrhea.*

**Plus**

\+ Sense of urgency. You feel your stomach pulsating, you go. No second guessing, no fooling around. You go. You run, you push people if needed. Pants down and release.

\+ Sounds. Amazing. Always makes me feel kind of proud to hear the sound volume my body can produce.

\+ The feeling. That little bit of pain in the anus. Gotta love it. Nohomo.

unpopularopinion,"Think about it. Nobody consented to be born but they shouldn't have a say in whether they want to take their own life? This is very hypocritical coming from the pro-choice crowd that say ""my body my choice"". Everyone who is pro-choice should be pro-suicide (and by pro suicide I mean you shouldn't encourage people to kill themselves but you should see that the act itself is not immoral). It's very similar to the argument that a woman who is raped shouldn't have to keep the rapist's child. A person who is conceived **without consent** then has to continue living to death.

As for the argument that their life could get better, yes that is technically true but certainly not in all cases. And this argument is mainly in the case of the person being depressed. What if the person just doesn't want to exist but not because they have are sad or depressed? Also, in lots of cases of people being both depressed and suicidal, their life never gets better, so you should give them the benefit of the doubt.

Women also seem to have had some bad experiences with men who don't follow proper hygiene, which might not be the majority, but it still a large percentage.

If you support a woman’s right to an abortion in the case where the man would prefer she have the child, in order to be philosophically consistent you must also demand that a man be able to force woman to have an abortion in the case where the woman would prefer to have the child.

Before the “My body, my choice” brigade:

Ok- 18 years of child support is a substantial amount of money which a man earned at work with their bodies. It’s a substantial amount of time being physically present with the child. It is a body being subjected to do things it would have preferred to avoid via abortion. 

If the argument was consistent in this fashion I would be able to grasp where it was coming from. The mental gymnastics required to support abortion as if it’s an extraordinary blessing to humanity are impressive to say the least."

I literally make excuses so I can leave the house everyday because I don't want to be around her. I can't stand the moodiness, the emotional neediness, the looking for attention, the constant negativity, the mental breakdowns and crying, the shouting, etc. My mom is so scared about my sister's mental health that she constantly comes to me looking for someone to talk to about it. I know my mom needs to vent her frustrations and worry to someone, but I don't want that someone to be me. I don't want any involvement.

Same goes for my depressed friends who 'joke' about how much they want to die all the time. It's not cute or trendy. It's so, so boring. What happened to the good old days when it was cool to be positive, happy, and uplifting? Now it's considered fashionable to be a energy vacuum. I'm tired of the deep conversations and the talk about therapy, medications, psychiatric evaluations, etc. I'm a young person and I just want to live my life without all of the heavy stuff. 

I know that suicidal people can't help that they're suicidal. It's not their fault. But it doesn't change the fact that I truly can't stand their behavior. I want suicidal people to get better, to want to live, and to have the happiest lives possible....But I don't want to get involved. I don't want them constantly texting my phone looking for attention. I don't want to spend hours on end talking them off the edge. I don't want to be their 'rock' or their 'shoulder to cry on.' I don't want to hear about their 'triggers.' It's annoying being caught up in it all. I just want to escape suicidal people and not be involved with them at all. I have my own problems ffs and I'm not a professional. I just want to have fun and have the least amount of drama as possible. My life is not a soap opera or a grungy teenaged drama series. 

Am I scared? Yes, I am. It scares me that these people can't control how they're feeling. I'm not ready to die yet, so I don't want to try relating to someone who wants to voluntarily end their life. I don't understand a suicidal person's mindset. I don't want to be there for them. Being around them ruins my mood. I don't want them to feel like a burden, but at the same time these people are a burden on me emotionally. I know it's selfish and people will judge me as a 'bad person' that I'm not being more compassionate, but it's truly how I feel. I'm looking after my own mental health by not getting involved with people who are verbally and emotionally abusive, then blaming it on being suicidal and scaring/guilting me into giving them attention."

A good example of this is people in the service industry. I'm sorry but if you're being incompetent and serve my steak cooked medium instead of medium rare, you're going to hear about it from me, and I'm not going to spare your feelings.

Giving likes/views, attention, and donations to boob streamers and “IG models”. I think a lot of those men that are viewing those are very young, and some grow out of it. Some of the women viewing The E! channel type of content are well into their 40’s, let alone all the ones that are in their 30’s and late twenties. Both groups being way too old to be viewing that type of stuff for anything other than entertainment. 

If it’s mostly men viewing boob streamers on Twitch and “IG models” that means women, especially young women, know it’s wrong and affects their psyche less than the Kardashians. The latter is making them very insecure, and more importantly I think that type of behavior they’re admiring from a Jenner is the same type of behavior that if they use it themselves would have their guard down and would be taken advantage of by creepy guys, which the Jenner’s have security if it were to reach a point to where it got physical.

If the person is more handsome than you, doesn't make even out of your league! Unless the person is an absolute PP, he will fall in love with your personality, not your looks.

unpopularopinion,"Unpopular but scientific opinion. Male circumcision has medical benefits. 

In 2012, the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://0-www-uptodate-com.library.acaweb.org/external-redirect.do?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpediatrics.aappublications.org%2Fcontent%2Fearly%2F2012%2F08%2F22%2Fpeds.2012-1990&amp;token=%2FQSqO5%2BCBKMNP8gZwXp4Rt16ZYX%2FgUkCHl8J4OIOR7%2FHfYwHYpLc2gokl03%2BFe7NGzFbkO8AA87KSvL%2FNLjWezF8%2B%2FRyNnuiPLa%2BPUrwwyw%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6716) (AAP) task force on male circumcision found males benefit from circumcision by having lower rates of urinary tract infections, acquisition of HIV, transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, and penile cancer and that Male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function/sensitivity or sexual satisfaction. 

Some highlights: 

1. Reduced UTI Risk: 
   1. Children
      1. Comparative studies found circumcision **reduced the risk of UTI** in infancy by almost **90 percent**. (1)
      2. Male foreskin susceptible to microabrasions that are thought to facilitate acquisition and transmission of infections. These infections are believed to be mitigated in the circumcised male by the keratinized glans (head) of the penis. 
   2. Adult: 
      1. In adults the lifetime risk of UTI in uncircumcised and circumcised men was **32.1 and 8.8 percent, respectively**. Lack of circumcision was estimated to account for 23 percent of UTIs during the lifetime of males. (2)
2. Reduced cancer risk: 
   1. Compared to uncircumcised men, circumcised men appear to have a lower risk of penile cancer, and their sexual partners may have a lower risk of cervical cancer. 
   2. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a **strong** **protective** effect of **childhood/adolescent circumcision on invasive penile cancer** (3)
3. Reduced risk in acquiring STIs: 
   1. In a study that pooled data from 1913 couples enrolled in one of seven case-control studies, circumcised men were **less likely** than uncircumcised men to have **HPV infection** and male circumcision was associated with a trend for **reduced risk of cervical HPV** and **cervical cancer in the female partner**. (4)
   2. There is high-quality evidence that circumcision **protects against** acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (**HIV**), **HPV**, and probably herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and also some evidence that it may protect against trichomonas and chancroid infection (5)
   3. Circumcision does not protect against infection from gonorrhea, chlamydia trachomatis, or syphilis.
4. Reduction in Retractile disorders. 
   1. The rates of **penile inflammation and phimosis were higher** in **uncircumcised** **boys** (penile inflammation: 14.4 versus 7.6 per 100 boys 0 to 8 years of age; phimosis 3.7 versus 0 per 100 boys 0 to 8 years of age) (6)

Many like to use Sexual Dissatisfaction as the main reason to not circumcise. 

\- Most circumcised males do not describe psychological trauma or decreased sexual function, sensation, or desire as a result of the procedure. In a systemic review of **36 studies, circumcision was not associated with decreased sexual arousal, sensitivity, or satisfaction**. (7)

unpopularopinion,"I'd like to note that this is not a call for violence. I'm also not advocating for violence.


The world can be violent place with violent people, policy's, and actions both direct and indirect.

People who pretend that violence is not necessary in the 21st century are not prepared to actually protect or gain their own freedoms. People against preemptively striking those who would want to see democracy, republicanism, and parliamentary monarchy destroyed are fucking pussys.

The United States did not become a country because of non-violent civil discourse. African Americans did not gain their freedom through non-violent civil discourse. North Korea will not free it's people and stop killing them in concentration camps because those in them ask.

Violence is very often times justified and the people that tell you it's not are cowards hiding behind bad principals or benefiting from you not fighting for yourself and others."

unpopularopinion,"I dont think having a month for a race's history or whatever is useful at all. Growing up, in school I would see posters and signs about ""black history month"" and me not being a black person, I always saw that as stupid. I would always thing black history (in America, since this is where we do it) is American history. People would be so heavily invested in it for a few days then completely forget about it for the rest of the month. I would always go ""ah shit, here we go again"" when it came around and be told the same things year after year. This would be the same with women's history. I would have to attend some assembly type stuff where I had to learn the same stuff year after year.

This year was a bit different. I was walking down the hall of my dorm to go study when I came across a poster about it being Asian Pacific American heritage month. I thought to myself, I dont need a month about me. I heard people talk about it for a day or two then it was gone. Just the occasional snap filter on someone's story. 

I dont think we need a month to celebrate/learn about a race or genders history or culture. We dont need a month (more like a few days) to focus on it then forget about it till the next year. We can just have American history which would include Black, Asian, women, etc since that's what American history is. It was a little annoying at first, but once there was a month about my race it just became more annoying and pointless."

unpopularopinion,"I've been visiting this sub daily for almost a week.

I've seen some actual unpopular opinions which are reasonable and make sense.

Also, I've seen some dumb unpopular opinions which really don't make any sense.

For an example, there was this opinion where someone who posted said that ""two people with different gender from each other cannot be just friends""  "" if they're friends, what are they going to talk  about? Kitchen? Dishes?""..

Another one was, ""women who wears Hijab ( Niqab) shouldn't be allowed to drive because they cannot see properly"".

The problem is, when you tell them this doesn't make any sense, they tell you that ""this is an actual unpopular opinion and you guys are downvoting"" ""This sub is *something*""."

unpopularopinion,"The books have the freedom to tell the story as your imagination sets up the scenes, the locations, the ideas and the the environment of the story line. 

This post is about the show, and I am confident I will absolutely get mauled for this but I guess that’s why this sub exists. 

The show felt silly to me. Scenes felt fake at times, the acting was weak on many occasions. I tried watching it multiple times and I couldn’t get over how silly it felt whether it be pushing a kid out of window to continue banging, riding a dragon through godly massive arrows that just took out another huge one next to it, and just so chill coasting on top of these flying monstrous beings like an air scooter. How the celebrations and drinking looked gimmicky. The sounds of battle sound like squishing fruits. How there is always this click of making someone popular and killing them, bringing them back, or running a mass genocide scene at the end of an episode or season to suck you back in with the “oh my god did you watch how it ended?” 

I was not able to commit to more than a couple of episodes because I was just unable to get past how stupid it felt! Tried to tag along with some family members for final episodes just so I can say, maybe the pilot and early episodes didn’t have as powerful acting, graphics, scenes, and environment. But the whole thing was a bag of wack story line, weird events, crap green screens, and still looked silly and fake. It reminded of shows like Hercules and Xena Warrior princess.

If I enjoyed anything during the time I tried to convince myself it’s watchable, it was the theatrical  music that came along.  

My apologies for the fans, this is my humble unpopular opinion."

It all boils down to the ulterior motive of garnering attention and views to get a hold of the profit they get from it. It has nothing to do with being a good person, in fact, it is belittling and cruel to use people in such manner.  If you want to do something good for someone, don't expose them like that. Even with their consent, you leave them no choice because they are desperate for what you're offering. Just because they agreed to it, doesn't mean it's okay."

You know what else? Most People aren't going to be nice to you! And if they are, they'll just say what they really feel about you behind your back. All that LGBT positive shit is great, but if I actually called myself ""a straight ally"" in real life and constantly talked about LGBT rights, I'd be labelled a weird motherfucker.

*breaking it down by subreddit*:

r/murderedbywords, r/bestof and similar subs: For example, a top post on r/all the other day was some stupid ass insult that went something like

""A tortiose can drink water through it's rectum, but you're a completely useless asshole"".

Oml, try it. Try that shit in a real arguement. 

But thousands, if not 10s of thousands of people were flocking to say how amazing and how lethal of an insult that was. Have I lost my mind!? Probably, but let's move on. 

The rest of Reddit's ""popular subs"" are fucking horrible too.

You shouldn't just leave your partner of 10 years because they left the toilet lid open r/relationshipadvice !!

Women aren't gonna fuck you because of some tip you read on r/askreddit !!

r/policticalhumor is basically facebook, they litterally post FB screenshots on there and call it ""humour"". 

In fact, most of reddit is a left wing circle jerk, but i actually see why. Besides r/conservative, all the right-wingers on reddit are fucking neo-nazi nutjobs (talkin to you r/frenworld)

And guess what, r/thathappened, r/vaxxhappened, r/facepalm and r/entitledparents? NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT. OR THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM. Most people are just as normal as you or I, you self-congratulatory asshat. Stop making shit up.


To all the women on r/gonewild and all other NSFW subs, stop acting like you don't know what you're getting into. You know what I mean. 

""*[f]irst time posting, do you guys like my virgin hole?*""

Like fucking obviously, yeah. Of the 2 million+ subs on gonewild, I'm sure at least 3 or 4 of them like your tits.


And that's another thing, Sex on reddit. Sex on reddit is beyond fucked up. Men especially, it's not okay to be THAT creepy. Even if you're a gay man, posting sexy photos of yourself (which is completely fine), you're crossing a goddamn line if you utter the words ""breed my boipussy"". It's not a pussy, it's a fucking asshole, that's the whole fucking point. 

If you comment on gonewild posts, that's fine. Openly expressing sex is healthy. You know what's not healthy? Straight up commenting how you'd love for OP to do your specific fetish.

 ""I wanna bend you over and fill you up"". Makes sense, we know where we are.

""I am but a humble rod, ma'am. I would love to breed you, oh most mighty goddess.

 ""Please stomp my dick"" 

NO. NOT OKAY. don't BRING YOUR SPECIFIC FUCKED UP FETISHES INTO MY LINE OF SIGHT.

God, i'm just so sick of such fucked up shit being normalized. Vore, ageplay etc. Is just so fucked up and gross. Get help if you're at THAT level of fucked up. And don't say ""oh well you obviously have fetishes too mr. u/thickandslow-"" you're damn right I do, and you know what they are!? normal shit! Not shit i gotta comission from some creep on deviant art.

unpopularopinion,"Seeing how the Thanos that actually collected the infinity stones and caused the snappening to happen dies 10 minutes into Endgame, we the audience are left with no real threat to worry about...That is until Noobmaster69 comes into play.

That’s right, Noobmaster69, a villain so strong not even Thor the strongest Avenger can defeat him. Sure he throws a few angry words at Noobmaster69 over a games voice chat feature, but our mighty Asgardian King is too afraid to confront the Noobmaster69 in person. Because of that, we never see his or her face and we are left wondering how powerful this character truly is.

One may argue the scene featuring Noobmaster69  seems like a small one-off cameo and will lead to nothing further, but let’s not forget how small Thanos’s role was at the beginning of the MCU. Let’s also not forget how little of Thanos’s physical appearance we saw until he was revealed to be the most dangerous enemy The Avengers have ever faced. Noobmaster69 is following in those very same footsteps. Honestly I will be very surprised if we don’t see a small sliver of Noobmaster69 in a Spider-Man: Far From Home end credits scene.

If I haven’t convinced you by now that Noobmaster69 is the true villain of Endgame, I’m sure your final argument will be that another Thanos appears to fight the Avengers at the end of Endgame so he is obviously the main villain of the movie. If this is what you believe, let me ask you something.

Did this second Thanos collect or have any Infinity Stones? No.

Did this second Thanos cause the Snappening? No.

Is this Thanos anywhere near as intimidating or powerful as the Thanos we saw in Infinity War? No.

This final Thanos battle is merely a trivial moment compared to what we saw in Infinity War, and the devastation we will see Noobmaster69 cause in future movies. Sure you could argue that the final Thanos fight was a  “big” battle and probably “cost a lot of money”  to produce but at the end of the day it was just a Lord of the Rings ripoff battle where Gandalf I mean Captain Marvel comes in halfway through to change the dynamics of the battle in favor of our heroes. We the audience have seen that. We saw that in 2004 and have been seeing it in different movies ever since. We want something new and different And Noobmaster69 is our only hope.

Noobmaster69 will give us a show far beyond what Thanos gave us and then some. Sure his role was small now, but just wait until Paul Fiege finalizes his 10 movie arch. He is the true villain of Endgame and future Marvel Movies.

BEWARE THE TRUE POWER OF NOOBMASTER69!!!!!!"

But she doesn’t she continues to beg me for money while I wait for my food. She tells me her life story on how she got addicted to drugs and how she drop out of high school, I wanted to tell her “I shouldn’t pay for your mistakes” but I just took out my phone  hoping she’ll get the signal to LEAVE ME TF ALONE. Eventually my food came and I gave the money and got change she saw that and she followed for two blocks begging me meanwhile we pass like 50 other people she could had beg. Eventually she gave up when I enter my work site. 

She shouldn’t give these people money, there’s are plenty of ways to make money if your homeless, plenty of ways to get something to eat. Most of these beggars use the money to fund there drug addiction.

unpopularopinion,"((This is just from my point of view as a clinically depressed person. This post does not condone self harm or encourage it but is simply my experience. I could be 100% wrong and just severely mentally ill.))

Self harm is most often used by people with depression to feel relief from something or to release the endorphins and feel something at all. Personally, I believe it’s stopped many people from flat out killing themselves because it gives that relief and chemical feeling of “this is okay now”. It’s minor pain for a giant release of endorphins and if people were discouraged from using it as a coping mechanism, they could just kill themselves (yes this is a slippery slope argument I realize, I only use it because I truly believe that there have been less people committing suicide because they had this outlet). It doesn’t affect the people who don’t have to live with depression every day, so I don’t see why they make it out to be such a bad thing."
unpopularopinion,"**Warning American's who have pride in their country may be offended so this is your warning before reading the following**

The UK gave all their colonies for the most part independent rule and only called on them for help in wars or to pay for debts from wars.

The UK set up democracies in all their colonies, giving the people a say in their government with simply a Governor General which is the monarchs representative and the Executive. Their only roll was to stop dead lock or corruption and make sure they had stability.

When colonies started asking for Independence they worked with them to slowly and stability seed power from GB to the colonies and federate them or turn them into nations. They helped create a constitution that works for the people and then when they felt they were ready let them fully govern themselves.

The only exception being the US who fought a war to become independent, then create a constitution which failed, so they had to create a second constitution which failed 80 years later, then fought a civil war only to have one party use terrorism to stop civil rights for the next 100 years and then have the other party take the roll of trying to roll back rights because 1/4 of the countries states are backwords.

God dammit if you wanted some cheese go melt some shredded cheese in a microwave instead of wasting an entirely good pizza.
unpopularopinion,"Let's make one thing clear, I think it is good to be antifascist aka Antifa. You may disagree, but this is not post about that.

&amp;#x200B;

If and when you don't like Antifa please complain about Antifa with correct terms. They are not fascist and here is why.   


Fascism is defined as:

"" **Fascism** is a form of radical, right-wing, authoritarian ultra nationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy"" by Wikipedia

"" **apolitical system based on a very** **powerful** **leader****,** **state** **control****, and being** **extremely** **proud** **of** **country** **and** **race****, and in which** **political** **opposition** **is not** **allowed** "" by  [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fascism](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fascism) 

"" a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power,forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., andemphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. "" by   [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fascism](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fascism) 

and this is pointed out about fascism by  [https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fascism](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fascism) 

"" Although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from one another, they had many characteristics in common, including extreme militaristic nationalism, contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism, a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a *Volksgemeinschaft* (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation.""

&amp;#x200B;

So are Antifa real fascist by these definitions? 

NO

Antifa certainly thick couple of these boxes. They want to suppers fascist by using force and we could debate if that is good or bad other time, but Antifa surely does that.  You could argue about Antifa being ""militaristic"" but I find this term when linked to fascism as more like strong army and stuff which Antifa opposes.

Now lets see how they differ from fascism. Antifa is not organisation it is more like action. There is no boss, membership or hierarchy, there are only Antifascist people. This is because many of ""members"" of Antifa are anarchist. Thus they hate hierarchy, strong government, dictator and racism. You could argue because some other far-left people (communist) support Antifa that they do want stong state but majority of Antifa does not. They also are very very very often left wing so that part does not click with fascism either. Last but not least its clear that Antifa does not have any nationalistic tendencies or anything to do with hating or loving any race. 

Only thing going for fascist Antifa is suppression of the opposition, but same could be said about police and you are not calling them fascist.

&amp;#x200B;

So please when you talk about Antifa and tell why you think they are bad, don't say they are the real fascist. There are other perfectly legit things to critic Antifa about.

&amp;#x200B;

Funny joke to end my rant:

&amp;#x200B;

Fascist: I want to do genocide.

Antifa: I want to stop you any mean necessary, even with violence

Centrist: I literally can't tell them apart."

One thing about the “body-positive” community I can’t stand though is that they support people who choose to be overweight. I’m not shitting on anyone who may be overweight due to their environment, inability to exercise due to a disability, or are overweight due to their medicine. I’m talking about the people who have the choice and opportunities to lose weight, and don’t! People who can’t control their weight due to external factors need to be supported, but I’m not going to support someone who has an unhealthy diet, doesn’t exercise, and is ruining their body just because they don’t feel like putting some effort in to keeping themselves healthy. The fact that it’s becoming more acceptable is a HUGE problem, and we shouldn’t support people who are just being lazy."

unpopularopinion,"To be honest, thanos was almost right, the world is really overpopulated, but we don't need to kill half of the living creatures on the planet.

The only thing we need is to control the exploding growth of population everywhere in the world, by letting families have a maximum of 3 children for each family, let me explain...

If you trace the strings behind almost every major problem in our planet, you'll find overpopulation to be one of the contributing factors in that problem, for example there's climate change, famines, pollution (in air, water, soil, etc..), immigration (not a problem to me but some people are annoyed by it), shortage of necessary supplies, and the list goes on, maybe they won't stop, but we can slow them down and search for a solution.

In my opinion, the numbers will never stop rising, because people are too selfish to care about the planet, they only think about the present moment, almost everyone wants to have kids, and the people in power are only interested in money and growing &amp; protecting their fortunes, remember how everyone were freaking out in 2012 because according to some myth that was the year of the apocalypse, now the planet's temperature is rising, and no know seems to care even though it's backed up by scientific evidence, the point is not enough people are worried about the future of this planet.

Think about it, if we actually stepped up and controlled the growth of population around the world, there will be more food available, more water, more resources, less pollution, less toxic gasses, less traffic, less crime, less wars (because governments will think twice before they risk the lives of their men) and climate change will slow down until we find a solution, and we'll have a steady growth of population that governments can actually help to provide its needs like medical care and education, and everyone will get the chance to have babies, and most importantly, human lives will have value, it will bring us the balance thanos was aiming to achieve, in a better way than his.

And what about that argument that says the numbers will stabilize one day, do you really think if we keep multiplying this way the human race will still be here by that time, or that the earth will keep providing for all of us for eternity?

Let's be honest, we're losing lots of species (some of them are vital) thanks to poachers, which will eventually impact the environment and then us, and the north pole is melting, so the sea level is rising by the day, and the planet is on fire, so maybe in the future even healthy people will be dying from heat, and we have a very long time ahead of us before any human foot would step on mars (which we will destroy too!), probably none of us will live until humans colonize mars, which means that this blue planet is the only home we have in the moment.   

You can say my argument is irrational and won't lead us out of the mess we're in, but at least it's better than going on wars over insufficient necessary life needs or going extinct, anyway, we've got to fix this problem or we're fucked!"

But your issue with that is you hate those bands so you are biased, well guess what, the 80s &amp; 90s generation wasn't perfect either, I hate the band Venom but you don't see me complaining that the Thrash scene is dead.


Secondly, kids are still listening to regular rock, maybe not the current Omega generation, but definitely some Gen Z &amp; Late Millenials, whether it be popular 60s/70s rock hits or 90s/2000s alternative.


Your problem is you can't accept the new generation likes bands you dislike.

However, we see rappers such as Logic, Lil Dicky, Gambino, etc. going on radio stations and spitting this ""INSANE FREESTYLE"" when theyre just performing their writtens. They obviously write these verses beforehand cos they know that they're gonna be asked to freestyle live on radio.

Don't get me wrong, these writtens are very impressive and good most of the times like Lil Dicky on Westwood or Logic and Gambino on Sway in the Morning. But they shouldn't be called freestyles cause I bet you most of today's rappers who spit writtens and call them freestyle can't really even freestyle for shit."
unpopularopinion,"Dogs in the restaurant seating area.  Dogs in the elevator.  Dogs getting it your way on the sidewalk.  Dogs pooping in a place where people are all around.  Dogs in shopping carts.  Dogs barking in an apartment building.  

As much as people love dogs, they’re animas- dirty and not meant to coexist so closely with humans.  If you want to push your dog on people, you should bathe it and brush it’s teeth daily like humans do.  Dogs shouldn’t be around humans unless they’re trained not to sniff people, lick people, and approach people who don’t ask to be bothered.  

Seems like people who don’t like dogs can’t live in apartment buildings or even be outside anymore.  When did the idea of dogs living as humans become so popular?"
unpopularopinion,"There is nothing wrong with being quiet. It’s just the way some people just are. People have always made erroneous, often negative assumptions about me because of my quiet nature. Quiet people are normal. Not everyone is extroverted. Being quiet is natural and how some people are wired. It’s not something one chooses. Yes, introverts (and extroverts, for that matter) can act out of character when the situation calls for it. An introvert can lead a group meeting, just as an extrovert can sit and listen. But overall, where you fall on the spectrum isn’t something you choose.

And that’s a big reason why it’s so off-putting to us quiet folk when you ask why we’re so quiet. You’re assuming it’s a choice and then, in a way, asking us to defend it.

You’re asking me to explain something that just is the way it is. It’s hard to do that. Imagine if I asked you why your eyes are blue or why you’re so short. Sure, you could provide a scientific or genetic explanation for why you have “x” trait, but for the most part, it just is what it is. You can’t change your eye color or height. I can’t change that I’m quiet. It is what it is and will always be so."

She wouldn’t shut up about it though so I got up and told her to get out of my house if all she’s coming here to do is get me wrapped up in some kind of scam. She told me I didn’t need to kick her out and that she would just stop talking about it if I really was not into it. I then grabbed her and screamed to get out and tried to get her out of my door. She then grabbed me and slammed me against the wall saying not to touch her. I then pushed her away and started dragging her out. She then grabbed me and we started wrestling and she wrestled me down to the ground and started saying “oh thought you were tough” repeatedly. I then swung at her and missed and then she started punching me while on top of me and then grabbed my throat and started choking me out. I couldn’t push her off of me and then she finally let go, told me I was a psychopath and deserved to be beaten up as much as I do and that she’s glad she could contribute to it and then left.


I also got my ass beaten by a date a couple of days ago. If a girl gets you into the right chokehold especially with their legs cause girls always have strong legs for some reason you’re just as done as you would be if it was a guy.

unpopularopinion,"I mean, in order to have a fruitful discussion about things, we must balance, in some way, between facts, biases/beliefs, rationality and emotions. We must consider anything by its significance:

1. Facts, Rationality
2. Emotions, Biases/Beliefs

Biases/beliefs should not be fully ignored, because sometimes they can tell us that the facts are wrong (seldom) by doubt. They can lead us to a different research that shows the opposite results. That will lead to a more productive discussion.

Emotions should not be fully ignored too, for the same reason, because they are produced by a psychological mechanism that exists in order to protect us.

So, in order to have a good discussion, everything should be considered according to its importance.

Unfortunately, most people don't get that, and the results of the discussions they join are poor.

Yeah, no one is perfect and emotions and biases can fully take over the rational thinking and vice versa,

It’s okay to be friends with women but actually dating them is a bad idea. False accusations, pregnancy, child support and treating you like a slave are all the burdens dating women get you. That’s why men should only date men and men should only be friends with women. Male and female friendships are the future. Male and female relationships are dying at a fast rate. Almost 50% of men are dating men and are only friends with women."

If you want to 'exterminate' the 'Nazis' so damn much, you need to realize you're not going to do that by groaning and moaning.

It's the same damn rhetoric used by any other group that has ever antagonized another group. Just because you're 'right' and they're 'wrong' doesn't change the fact that the rhetoric is annoying.

It's like watching the same damn sitcom, where they change the villain but have the same damn plot. In the 20's it was the Catholics and the Eastern Europeans, in the 40s it was the Semites, in the 60s it was the blacks, in the cold war it was the Soviets, now it's the damn 'Nazis'.

 Get some new material, at least put some damn action into the f***ing script. It's tiresome to hear this pointless shit all day from anyone with an opinion. The right is just as bad as the left, they use literally the identical f***ing rhetoric to condemn the people they don't like, they just happen to be ethnocidal on top of being politicidal.


My choice is either to read the sentence 'dogs are awesome, f*** cats, cats are shit, kill all cats', or 'cats are awesome, f*** dogs, dogs are shit, kill all dogs'.

Neither of these plot-lines are interesting, and neither of these plot-lines ever move beyond groaning and moaning. It's as tireless, boring, and insufferable as watching paint on the wall that never f***ing dries and screams incessantly.

When I look, I just see cats and dogs, which are literally just meat animals. Meat is meat at the end of the day. I really don't see a f***ing difference, but you f***ers love to worship one or the other like god damn cultists. 

Getting inspired over this shit, over left vs right, it's like getting inspired over sports. 'Go Sox, F*** the Yankees' or 'F*** the Sox, Go Yankees'.

Baseball is f***ing stupid, and even watching baseball is 100x more tolerable than this shit. It's clearly a f***ing miracle that in the sport of baseball, even if very rarely, once in a f***ing blue moon, something actually happens, some guy runs around or hits the ball or something.

Politics is even more boring than this, but this insufferable knock-off baseball is somehow so god damn popular that it is inescapable.

The way you win in sports is by playing the f***ing game, hitting the ball, running around; you don't play sports just by shouting and cheering. You're all shouting and cheering at nothing, absolutely nothing, a barren f***ing field and you all scream night and day for your imaginary stick-wielding baseball boys.

I don't get it. I'm just looking at these cats and dogs, and I'm f***ing baffled. It's just f***ing meat at the end of the day, and I don't even support humans eating domesticated meat products. That's a waste of resources and the defense of the existence of an entirely unnecessary trophic level.


You're not saints, you're not champions of good, you're just nags, you're just annoying. If your groaning and moaning doesn't amount to anything, it's just the endless pointless barking of dogs in the night.

These posts are as stupid as 'Upvote if you like blue', and people upvote their damn color and think it's f***ing incredible and empowering, like they're changing the world because they have an opinion. The people on this website always like blue, having a damn popularity contest on the front page to remind the website how popular that damn color is gets f***ing tiresome. I believe this term is ‘circle-jerk’ but it’s f***ing childish and pointless.

There's a reason people get upset with you, it's the same reason you get upset with the right. The rhetoric is annoying, especially if you're the odd one out who doesn't experience this profound euphoria whenever somebody says 'red is a shit color, blue is the best' or the other way around. The only reason I have a marginally higher support the right is because they're the 'champions of hatred' and unsurprisingly enough I thoroughly f***ing hate every aspect of the human race, that's the only legitimate opinion I have at this point.

This is why Luther f***ed the world. Before Luther, people couldn't have opinions because God's opinions were facts and contrary opinions were a death-sentence. After Luther, people realized that their opinions could be on-par with the 'word of God' and now every person with an opinion thinks that they're God in the f***ing flesh coming down to provide salvation for the human race.

I'm not saying 'The Bible is fact', but it sure did solve the problem of having to tolerate hearing people incessantly projectile vomit their f***ing opinions all over the place while they think of themselves as f***ing God incarnate.

One of you f***ers better win this damn argument, because I'm sitting at the train station waiting to be sent to a death camp or a gulag, and I'm getting real f***ing tired of waiting.

TL;DR: Politics is a waste of time and f***ing nonsense. It's just cats and dogs, and cats and dogs are just meat. Meat is by default a wasteful luxury, any use beyond that such as 'fur friendship' is hedonistic luxury which doesn't even provide any use.

unpopularopinion,"If you live in a western country, having a March to stop pollution is incredibly pointless and asinine. 

The top ten countries in the world that commits the most ocean pollution are all third world or developing nations and aside from China they aren't that big population wise compared to the West. 
China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Thailand,  Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. 
When it comes to the top counties that mass mismanage plastic, the first Western country comes at number 20 (US) with the same 10 countries I've listed previously occupying the top ten once again.

As an aside as well, the top 15 cargo ships emit more greenhouse gas than the all the cars in the world combined. 

What's the point about having a stupid protest against your government when the West is largely the only part of the world making wide sweeping motions in the name of climate change. Most people assume the United States is the worst country and it is, the worst western country, but by far is it the least damaging to the environment. 
Now having specific protests like marching on a company for mismanaging their waste, that's an appropriate protest. But marching for climate change in general, displaying your stupid messages like ""fuck me not the world"" or ""climate change is harder than homework"" on cardboard imported from China written by toxic non environmentally friendly permanent markers is hypocritical and pointless. Most climate protest events probably cause more pollution just for existing than if they just carried on like normal."

I keep wondering why we don’t see a push for countries with way smaller populations to test out socialism first. Wouldn’t something like Sweden or even Canada be a better place to try socialism due to having implemented more socialist policies as it is? Even Finland’s UBI test did not go as planned and was shut down. Also, people need to realize you cannot support illegal immigration or open borders while maintaining any hopes that UBI or universal healthcare will work with population increases like the US. I believe it’s around 20 million or so every 10 years and I’m not sure if that counts undocumented.  Another thing we may need to accept is that maybe a side-effect of socialism is that it leads to communism. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to see healthcare and money for all, but we should not feed into this idea from politicians unless we are hearing realistic ways to pay for it that won’t leave our dollar useless.

unpopularopinion,"Sure some people are first concerned with they themselves having no free will and that idea makes them uncomfortable.

But I'm not like that to be honest 

And I never met such person. All people I talked to irl about there maybe being no free will their first reaction is (same as mine was initially about hating someone or moral superiority) : 

""So what I should stop hating criminals for their disgusting acts because they didn't choose to do what they did? Or all the things I did right have no higher value in terms of me making right decision than those who did bad things(which could be said is connected to not liking idea of not having free will but people mostly concentrate on talking about how they created their decision so they created morally superior idea and acted on it which makes them morally superior )

I think it's neutral to want to hate because its strong emotion and there is need and comfort on blaming something on someone. And idea that there isn't such a thing bothers people the most.

But also it's human primitiveness we should overcome if there isn't free will, because I feel like society doesn't want to consider this idea because believing alternative is nicer. 

It's hard to know for sure if there isn't free will there is some evidence but nothing is 100% proven yet but I believe it should be one of our priorities to figure it out and overcome out primitive desires to hate or feel superior  imo because it can shape a lot of out decisions as society in future."

Nowadays (Specifically, after 2008) they all became these over-gentrified shitholes of historical architecture being destroyed to build shitty glass-and-steel monstrosities, homeless people everywhere, and extremely overpopulated hellholes.

I kid you not, my grandmother raised two kids in 1970s/80s/90s NYC by herself and still had money left over. There were apartments on the lower east side of Manhattan for $300 a month and anyone who had a job could afford them.

After 2008, the natives of Boston/NYC/Chicago all got kicked out to these rural and suburban areas in the middle of nowhere with no jobs while all these rich people turned everything into extremely expensive shitholes that no one could live in.

People who have visited San Francisco and Los Angeles have told me that there are people shooting up in the streets and that there were homeless people on every block. 

Honestly what the hell happened to everything? What happened to working class America being able to afford everything?

For example- i checked out r/HydroHomies and left very quick bc for every post with a plastic recyclable water bottle in the pic, *every other goddamn comment* was something like ""hm get a reusable water bottle, make sure u recycle those"" OR another example is LITERALLY any post with a pic of a pet has sOME GD ""PET EXPERT"" in the comments making sure the owner is taking care of their pet and making sure they are doing xyz and im done!!! I understand that its good we are critically thinking, and perhaps the poster Isnt doing something correctly, perhaps you even have helpful advice that the poster hasnt considered- but Those Chances Are Slimmer Than You Think. People know what recycling is 🤭. Pet owners probably know how to take care of their pet if they aren't asking for help 🤷🏾‍♀️.

He live-streamed the shooting and said “ subscribe to Pewdiepie” After this, Pewdiepie got a shit ton of hate, and people blaming him for the shooting. What the fuck.

unpopularopinion,"all of it, is racism. Doesn't matter what subcategory you throw it in. It's all racism and shouldn't exist. It's bullshit it does, but there isn't a need to subcategorize racism. Also, to condemn someone for living in a society, especially when I myself have see the worse ends of shit and still stood up for what's fair, is close minded and also bullshit.  I'm white. I know what you're talking about. I have also lived very poor, homeless for a long time. I've traveled and seen many cultures. I've had people go out of their way to be blantently racist towards me because society favors whites. But that hasn't changed the fact that no matter who you are, you can always fight for fairness. Sometimes, like in America if you're part of a minority, you might need someone part of the majority. But usually one is enough to sway more into fairness. There's no obligation to either side that must be upheld. No need for anyone to act like they are more privileged. I absolutely hate it when people bring up slavery and shit. I'm Irish. Know what race was enslaved the longest in history and treated the worst? Irish. But I dont go around demanding shit. I hate when people bitch about jobs going to illegal immigrants. Like, those fuckers can't even speak English most the time. Why are you losing out on jobs to them? I hate it when people act like they own the place. Who gives a shit if someone came from a poor place. Who cares if you're black or yellow or brown or white or peach or indigo or fucking green shit color. We are all one race. Fucking human beings. If you want to say something against that then all you're trying to do is get one up on someone and gain sympathy for something outside of fairness. Racism is discrimination NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. So don't don't go saying bullshit subcatagories and blaming everyone for a small groups actions. I will defend fairness between all. You should focus on that instead of how one should say you've been specifically dealt the racist card."

You know, all the annoying spoiled kids or the... clothing merch or even how YouTubers milk videos of it... “Fortnite bad” memes were fine when they started I guess... but now it’s just a little stale... and I don’t like how people hats on something simply because it’s popular... and it’s not like it’s something cringy like a dumb challenge on YouTube or something, it’s just a game.

unpopularopinion,"First of all, I wouldn’t consider myself a suicide supporter. I definitely think there should be stuff done about mental health. Now that we got it out of the way that I’m not an outright supporter of dead children, we can begin with my main argument.

SUICIDE IS WHAT THEY WANT. Most people that commit suicide are in the state of mind that they would rather be dead. There is something ailing them that in that moment they feel is irredeemable by time, and therefore only medicated by death. In this time, especially when everyone is outing themselves as PRO-CHOICE (I’m pro choice as well, but I am able to see the similarities between a mother not wanting to subject herself or her child to misery, and someone that is born not wanting to subject themselves to more misery through suicide), we have to recognize that people have the right to do what they want with their bodies. THEY want this, and it’s selfish to be upset at their decision.

Next, the overpopulation. There are many predictions that overpopulation can present itself as a major threat in the upcoming years whether it be through direct social effects of population density or scientific ones like an exponential increase in greenhouse gas emissions. You can say that the people that commit suicide are the people that MOST want to die out of the general population. Therefore, these suicide deaths from people that are the most accepting of dying will help to limit overpopulation in the future. Getting upset at this is inherently selfish. While it may be part of current-day society be upset at death, it’s selfish nonetheless."

unpopularopinion,"I would assume that people might call this a popular opinion, but it plays out on Reddit constantly in just about every post related to Science, Climate change, Medicine, Social media, you name it. Not many people who espouse this opinion practice what I discuss below. Basically, our obsession with the rights of freedom and equality have been applied to an area in which they do not belong: The truth.

 Unqualified individuals with no credentials or expertise offer their opinions/beliefs on subjects they have at most, a rudimentary understanding of, and they believe they have the ""right"" to have these opinions and beliefs respected (they don't).

To quote from ""The Death of Expertise"" by Tom Nichols: “No, the bigger problem is that we’re proud of not knowing things. Americans have reached a point where ignorance, especially of anything related to public policy, is an actual virtue. To reject the advice of experts is to assert autonomy, a way for Americans to insulate their increasingly fragile egos from ever being told they’re wrong about anything.”

""When feelings matter more than rationality or facts, education is a doomed enterprise.”


One of the biggest ways I see this play out on reddit is taking an extremely complicated and complex societal issue or statistic and simplifying it down to one basic conclusion to seem righteous and put themselves up on a moral soapbox, that's not winning an argument, it's being disingenous.

People need to practice more humility, realize that certainty in ANY belief, no matter how righteous it seems, is the enemy of progress, change and growth. Doubt yourself, doubt your beliefs, try out different beliefs in your head without committing to them. Above all, trust science, trust people with decades of experience in their fields, practice trust, because that's something that's been declining over the years."

Sure. If you overdo it, and your response is disproportionate, you're in the wrong, should be held accountable, prosecuted and shamed for that.

&amp;#x200B;

But if the response is equal, and the assailant is not mentally challenged or a child, then who the fuck cares?

If you possess the enlightenment to withhold from retaliation, good on you. Perhaps the assailant will take you as an example. Probably not though. Probably, this will reinforce the idea in their head, that they can get away with violence.

But if you don't, that's fine too in my book. Noone deserves to be treated better, than what they treat others like. Noone can lay moral claim, to what they take from others.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't have any sympathy with the person who is being retaliated against. I don't understand how anyone can.

I don't know why some people think that gender changes things, either.

It might have an influence on how much force it takes for a retaliation to be disproportionate.

But the retaliation is either disproportionate, which makes it wrong, regardless of gender, or it is NOT, which means it's only fair, regardless of gender."

unpopularopinion,"Which is why innocent until proven guilty is so important, and not guilty until proven innocent. The current social climate seems to be trying to get more people convicted with no more evidence available than before. The only way to do this is to lower the amount of evidence needed to convict people. In the UK the courts tell juries to convict a defendant if the evidence presented suggests that they are guilty ""beyond reasonable doubt "". There are some people that want the amount of evidence for conviction to be lowered. Meaning that a lot of innocent people will be affected, if we start telling juries to convict a defendant if you get a hunch that they are guilty. I personally think that the current system already asks for too little evidence, and until there are no longer people being exonerated for crimes that they didn't commit, the bar set for evidence to convict will always be too low."

unpopularopinion,"This is just a personal opinion, but I do not see why people continue to pursue marriage any more. Very rarely do I see it work out, and when it does it seems to be more of a sense of duty/obligation on at least 1 persons end. More and more people are removing their shackles and trying to become more free. The thing is that marriage is one of those shackles and can bind someone down, if you and your SO have different opinions on certain things one party must give in, its like keeping each other in check really. Many will say that they are totally fine with their SO going out and doing w/e they want, but realistically this is BS. They'll want the others to attend certain events, or maybe one of them wont want to go to some place and will make the other one feel bad for going alone. 

Marriage used to be set in a way that was admittedly bad and it only worked because of one reason. The woman could not leave the man without destroying her reputation, and well sadly they didnt have many rights. Now that both men/women are on fairly equal terms, its not wrong of them both to be selfish, but being selfish means that they will have many conflicting ideals, and marriage will only hold back these ideals in my opinion. I'm not saying it CAN'T work out, I'm just saying it shouldn't be a common ritual that is expected any more, as I think in today's times it is highly outdated and only holds people back."

All you doing is hitting a goddamn golf club, “Oh my God man, that’s a long ass birdie man, nice birdie, nice putt, man it went 250 yards.” Get the fuck outta here, nobody care about that boring ass shit. Who the fuck really watches golf, my nigga? Nobody gives a fuck, it makes niggas fall asleep. Fishing on the other hand, what the fuck are you really doing athletically, my nigga, in fishing? All you’re doing is that you’re sitting your bitch ass up in a boat, usually it’s old ass snagger-teeth motherfuckers that ain’t got no goddamn teeth up in they fucking grill, or up in they mouth.

You guys want to consider that shit to be a sport? Jacking off is a fucking sport to me. Jacking off and beating your motherfucking dick to porn is a sport. There’s two damn things that you have to do. A. You build up a sweat. Well actually, you don’t have to do shit. There’s basically two things that goes down, that’s what I meant to say. A. You’re building up a sweat. I don’t give a fuck nigga, if you are building up a sweat, goddamn it, that’s shit is considered a sport. You’re building up a sweat. Number 2, and the most important part of that shit, is that your hand is getting a workout. Your hand is getting a workout, nigga, you are building up your arm strength, and you are building up your hand strength, okay. I don’t know about you, nigga, but when I’m beating my shit, nigga, my fucking hand muscles get fucking tight, you know what I’m saying? And that shit wears the fuck out of my entire left arm. I used to be able to do it with my right hand, can’t do that shit, so I do it with my left hand. So, in my personal opinion, do you guys consider jacking off a sport? Nigga, in my opinion, I believe it is. So I know with some of you trolling ass bitches are gonna say “Oh, man, you must not get no pussy, motherfucker, if you jack off.” Motherfucker, let’s be real, okay? Everybody has jacked off once in they goddamn life. If you gonna sit back, and you gonna come on my post, and troll my shit, say “Oh, nigga, I never jacked off once in my life.” Bitch, stop lying. Everybody does this shit, okay? So please miss me with that bullshit, nigga, and go preach that shit to somebody who fucking is actually gonna listen to you, okay? Number 2, “Oh my God, this post was stupid. It was pointless.” Couldn’t’ve been that stupid, bitch, you still clicked on it! You know what I’m saying? All the motherfuckers that’s looking at this post, nigga, you saw the title of the fucking post before you clicked on the post. So it couldn’t’ve been that damn stupid if you still proceeded to click on the motherfucker. So, jacking off. The shit’s a sport, fuck it."

I don't understand why people think being in the friendzone in the initial stages of meeting someone is so bad. Just because you're interested in dating someone, doesn't mean that you two should begin the phases of dating. That person may have their own issues going on, and I'm not sure about most people, but I feel that issues are easier go discuss with a friend rather than someone you just started dating. Being in the friend zone helps clear all the uncertainties you may have. Also, you may find a major relationship red flag in someone, but as a friend, they're great. So while being in the friend zone, you either come out and start a relationship with that person, make a great friend, or dodge a bullet."

unpopularopinion,"A million dollars is a whole heck of a lot more than having zero dollars in the bank account. However, having a million dollars is NOT a lot of money especially given inflation and cost of living. I live in the most expensive state in the union, California, where $1 million dollars MIGHT buy you half a house depending on your location.

The AVERAGE person needs 1.5 million dollars and a paid for house to retire comfortably. When people say they hate rich people, what they really mean is they hate DECA millionaire's or people who act irresponsibly with their money.

Having one, two, three, or even five million dollars doesn't make you rich-especially where I live. 

I was running retirement numbers and if I wanted to live comfortably in retirement in California, I'd likely need 3-4 million dollars (on top of a paid off house). People FEEL RICH in the Bay Area and LA when they have 7-8 million dollars according to many survey's.

Also-where I live, 85,000 pretax income and UNDER is considered LOW INCOME. The Bay area defines low income as 115k and under!

A million dollars isn't a lot of money. The people who say they hate rich people really don't know who they say they are hating. 

The last thing that urks me is that people think millionaire's are people who MAKE a million dollars per year. A millionaire is someone with a NET WORTH of $1,000,000 or higher. And many of them came from humble backgrounds making average income's of 70-80k/year.

TL;DR: CS is a comedy YouTube channel, what they do are make jokes and you shouldn’t get upset over them. It’s all in jest, they don’t deserve the hate that they get. 


All the time I see people posting or talking about how CinemaSins are incredibly mean, dumb, hateful and hurtful. However I don’t see it like this at all. 

What people always seem to forget is that they’re a comedy YOUTUBE channel. They’re trying to be funny, even if the jokes don’t land for you. People look way to deep into them, they’re just a group of guys who make YouTube videos. Why do they get looked at so negatively for what, in the end, are just jokes. 

They have said on multiple occasions that the movie they’re looking at they actually like, so they don’t hate every movie they put on. I feel like a lot of the people that hate them are just mad that at one point they made a video about a movie they really liked. 

For people that bring up the point “they make stupid dings on stuff that is stupid and nothing to do with the movie.” Yes, these are called JOKES. Also why are you so upset over an imaginary and arbitrary point system that they give? If you like the movie they’re making fun of then fine, continue to like the movie. Who cares what some guys on a YouTube channel think about a movie?

I’m not saying they’re the greatest YouTube channel ever made, I’m not saying they’re even that funny. However I don’t think they should be getting all the flak that they get."

A prime example is my father who LOVES going to the beach and tries to take every opportunity to do so with the family. When I refuse to get in the water, he gets offended and blames me for ruining the mood of the day. But usually, some form of disappoint is what I experience when anybody from friends to SOs realize that I will not go into the water.

I cannot stand most everything about it: 
*** The perpetual sticky feeling from basically everything associated with the beach whether it be salt water, sunscreen, sweat, or any combination of the aforementioned
*** The sand getting in every crevice it can find and roughly exfoliating my already sensitive skin
*** The seagulls stalking your area anytime anyone dares to open a snack and not leaving even if you shoo them away
*** I’m also a person who generally dislikes the sensation of feeling wet. I only like water when I am either cleaning myself or drinking it. But  seawater and pool water just feel harsh on skin and, most of the time, dirty.

It’s easy to say “Oh, I’d want to know the truth” when you’re not one who’s going learn that your daughter isn’t your daughter. If someone is living in happy ignorance, why do we just automatically assume it’s the “right” thing to do to take that happiness away? 
Even people I know are always like “I want to know the truth, no matter what”, but there are instances where they would never know the truth unless you told them and telling them would only hurt them, not possibly help them. 
It’s similar to when your parents are always like “It’ll only hurt more if you lie to me.” Bullshit. Anybody who drank that Kool-Aid knows after they get beaten the first time it won’t matter either way, so why not try and avoid it to begin with.

You are depriving them opportunities they could have had if you had focused on fewer children. This is willful neglect, and therefore is abusive."

Too often to hear people talking and almost bragging about how they ""don't do politics"" and don't stay educated on issues. This should not be acceptable. Politics determines virtually everything- one poorly thought out policy can take everything that makes your life yours away. Action from the government was what started the holocaust and any one of the many atrocities- and the civilized world is not immune from this. The government when unchecked has the power to do virtually whatever it wants. 

But we don't even have to take it to the extreme. The politics that too many choose to ignore dictates what wars we fight, if some will have to go without support from the government, if you'll have a job tomorrow, etc. And some choose to actively ignore this and not take advantage of the freedoms so many around the world in the past and even to the day can't enjoy. 

Apathy is not compatible with democracy. We need to start treating being politically active as the civic duty it is. Edmund Burke once said ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"", and I quite like this quote. We must heed warnings from history and seize our political power before it's too late."

Not only that, but political parties assume opinions and actions on certain legislation, so if your opinion on a subject differs from the rest of your platform, fuck you and your chances at getting elected. It promotes politicians who lie about their intentions to get votes from their platform and rips the spine out of those who don’t agree with popular opinion."
unpopularopinion,"I was a strict believer that recognising when you’re wrong and apologising is a trait of the stronger man, however my experience does not back that all, it seems that apologising is simply showing vulnerability to someone who’s already displaying hostile attitude towards you and allowing them to belittle you. This is particularly evident with women as I feel they enjoy shaming and undermining anyone who ever disagrees with them on anything, but men are guilty of taking advantage of people apologising to them as well. 

Apologies hold no value if the person doesn’t execute some degree of revenge to you, and that’s why I feel in this modern overpopulated day, it’s better to simply brush off someone and avoid them than to allow them to traumatise you or anger you in some way or the other, there are billions of people on earth, no one’s special enough to be worth an apology."

Now, it's a cesspool. It seems like 90% of the relevant anime today is the most generic, formulaic crap to ever be created. There's barely any artistry involved anymore, the only thing that matters is how the show will appeal to horny losers with no life. There, I said it.

Don't get me wrong, good anime is still being made, even to this day. But they always aren't as recognized as the trash shows I mentioned above, and even the better shows aren't good as the things we got back in the 80's."

You stabbed me
Then pretended 
You were the one 
Who was bleeding.

That's not a fucking poem. You can literally write it like this and it'll be much better :

*You stabbed me and pretended you were the one who was bleeding.*

Because when it's written like the example I gave, I read it like this :

You stabbed me, *pause*, them pretended, *pause*,  you were the one, *another useless pause* who was bleeding.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is the highest grossing film franchise in human history.

Videogames were a completely niche interest at one point, and we're thought to be mostly for kids. Any teens or adults playing videogames were considered to be pathetic losers that were made fun of for it. Now videogames are a massive multi-billion dollar industry, with many games gaining a mainstream appeal. Being a gamer now is akin to being into music or movies, it's just another entertainment medium.

Various Geek Conventions were reserved for the most hardcore of social outcast adult virgin losers and weirdos. You know, the creepy fanatics who got together dressed up in costume to pursue their niche nerd intersets. Now you can't Google the word ""Cosplay"" without seeing numerous sexy ladies dressed up as every kind of fictional character imaginable. E3 is one of the biggest events of the year, and most people that go to conventions are just average Joes.

Kids aren't made fun of or bullied in schools or thought of for being inferior is of they merely enjoy Sci-fi Fantasy / Superhero movies, play videogames, go to conventions, etc.

There will always be the socially awkward outcasts of society who are drawn to Geek Culture as a means of escapism, but that's no longer the only crowd. Geek Culture is just it's own new version of ""cool."" Anyone who calls someone a geek or a nerd in a derogatory sense has got to be mentally stuck in a different era."

unpopularopinion,"Sir Winston Churchill once said the best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the average voter. Democracies these days are inherently flawed and we have reached a point where most are incredibly ineffective. Take the UK's situation at the moment: in 2016 they had a referendum to leave or remain in the European Union. The vote was to leave 51% and remain 49% - in which case 49 percent, an incredibly large portion of the population are held to the will of the 51, while although larger, only marginally. This was actually one of Platos main criticisms in 'the republic'. In the ensuing years, the country has found no resolute way of actually going forwards with leaving as it turns out the government is not actually capable of achieving this, with the opposition party and other smaller parties voting against the proposal to leave and the main party being unable to get anything done. Today the results of another EU election came through and the results were effectively a third want to leave the EU, a third want to stay and a third have splinters up their arses from sitting on the fence. This is a gross oversimplification of course. If a country were able to bring to power a dictator who was of for arguments sake impeccable moral quality and intelligence, it would be an infinitely better system of rule. Thing would actually get done, we could move forwards with good ideals that in a democracy the old fashioned and dead weights would oppose for religion or the fact they are more concerned with being reelected than progression."

What I hate is the implied attitude that normal, perfectly healthy kids are never just being little shits. The expectation that we should all think to ourselves ""this screaming child throwing oranges at me in the Aldi is not a problem for me because he might have Atomic ADD and I need to be sensitive to that.""

Typical kids act out for lots of reasons all the time. A 4 year old throwing a bratty tantrum at the store might be tired,bored,or hungry - and it's okay if people are annoyed by having to listen to him scream and yell or make a mess. It's okay if their first thought isn't ""does this preschooler have autism?"" 

I love kids, btw. Im not a child hater. I understand that sometimes kids are just done and it's not easy to control it and it can be unpredictable. 

My main TL;DR point is that a normal kids act out all the time and people dont need to assume that they have some hidden difficulty to excuse the bad behavior."

unpopularopinion,"Okay here me out, because I'm not justifying speeding here. 

People who drive 10km/h under the speed limit are not being safer, it's more dangerous. In reality, they're causing a lot of people around them to get frustrated and they're selfishly holding up all the traffic because they don't want to drive the speed of the road. Everyone is trying to get from A to B so what gives you the right to decide that all the traffic behind you has to drive slower just because you don't want to? I would say 99% of the vehicles on the road are not there for a casual drive, they're there because they need to get somewhere. 

People who drive slower than the speed of the road don't appear to think about how that choice affects everyone, and at times even have this self-righteous attitude that they're doing this noble thing by not driving as fast as legally possible. They also tend to argue that they're not in any way affecting the causality of people behaving more dangerously around them because ""that's their choice"". If you are ignorant to your surroundings and do not show any consideration for how your actions affect other people, you are a part of the problem whether you like it or not. Good intentions do not excuse you from  producing a negative result. 

Note: I get that there are people who don't feel confident driving that fast - maybe they're learners and that's fine. That's why we have learner plates, so everyone knows that this person is new and so other drivers can understand. 

People who don't want to drive the speed of the road should pull over and let people pass. It's okay to not feel that you should have to drive faster than you're comfortable. But that doesn't mean everyone else has to drive slowly and just deal with it because you don't want to. 

Pre-emptive counter argument:

1. A lot of people say things about studies that show weaving around traffic etc is no more effective than just driving slower - I call bullshit. If everyone on the road drove considerately, then everyone would get where they're going more efficiently. The reason it produces results that show now extra efficiency is because a LOT of people drive ignorantly. 

2. If the ""ten seconds"" that's saved by someone speeding around you is so meaningless, why don't you pull over for that amount of time and absorb it so everyone else doesn't have to? 10 seconds to one person who doesn't mind &gt; 10 seconds for ten other people who clearly do mind."

Veterans need help, they need care and support for traumas they endured. No hero should feel alone or desire to take his own life.

unpopularopinion,"So, to preface all of this, let me start by saying I have no dislike or hate for anyone in the cosplay community - especially those who cosplay appropriately. 

I personally don't like cosplay at all  because in most cases, it takes away from  my idea of that character's personality or substance in some way, shape or form. This is mostly in respect to anime/manga/cartoons, but can sometimes be the case with cosplays from video games as well. I think it usually annoys me the most when that character has a certain personality trait(s) or physical trait that isn't really portrayed well by the artist in cosplay. To be clear, this has nothing to do with skin colour at all - that's not what I mean. It's rare for me to ever like cosplay unless it is so well done that I can't see that person as anything other than that said character. This is also more of an issue with characters with backstory, development, lore, etc. The more baggage there is in making a character, the more I don't think I like the cosplay. For example, Reinhardt from Overwatch in my opinion is hearty, and German and muscular and tall and he has a clip and some comics of how he acts, and almost every cosplay I see of him, fits. That's because in comparison to most shows or cartoons or comics, there's not much substance there. Versus maybe seeing Wonder Woman, Okabe Rintaro, Green Lantern, Tom and Jerry (for obvious reasons) who have had shows and cartoons and anime, so on and so forth. 

I truly feel like I'm in the minority here, any time at a convention or a club, I'm asked about cosplay, this is usually my answer. I may be wrong though, as I saw a LOT of people complaining about the new Aladdin and Lion King because they don't reflect the characters well or portray their story well enough. Same concept here, except for me it's also with cosplay or art.

It's much much much much much worse when it comes to NSFW cosplay or art  - portraying a character that wouldn't normally be sexual  / having sex makes me feel kinda disgusting, and NSFW cosplay  in some mediums can be really messed up, sometimes portraying 14 or 15 year olds. Instantly puts me in a sour mood."

If you need to get through deep snow the lift comes in handy.

Having the hood above moose shoulder height is an important safety feature in the rural north. 

If you want to go out to dinner with 4 of your bros and they are all 6’ plus the giant cabin with tons of headroom is great.

If you need to carry a pallet of cement up a mountain road lesser vehicles will not suffice.

All these reasons are why I love owning a lifted super duty truck on big tires. Big trucks get a lot of hate because they burn a lot of fuel. I get better mileage than most vintage muscle cars, which have none of the practical benefits of a brodozer."

Anyway I relayed the story to my friend about taking the test and he said he wouldn't want to know if he had HIV. I said that I'd want to know just for my wife's sake and he countered with she probably already contracted HIV if I had it. So the more I thought about it the more he was right. There's nothing good to come from the HIV test. If it's positive you're screwed anyway, so better to live in ignorant bliss."

unpopularopinion,"First. I think both are disgusting terms that only sad people use.

My reasoning for this is that while the racial term has much history behind it and we are only recently getting to a point where reprocussions can be seen, that it doest make sense to trivialize mental handicaps in comparison.

One utterance of the racial term can easily destroy a persons career/life, even more so when one of the civil rights figureheads such as (off the top of my head) Al Sharpton intervenes. Which I understand.

However even as I'm posting this there is a /all front page meme referring to being retarded for not attending private school. While its easy to jump to the ""oh its a joke"" why is it so trivialized in comparison? Maybe due to the fact it is a term used to cut down people with mental handicaps, whom dont have as prominent figureheads and those who fall into the mental handicap spectrum may not be able to speak out as well as someone who was racially cut down.

I know its an unpopular opinion but it just is confusing why the racial term has such heavy consequences when compared to a similar term that cuts down some of the most vulnerable people."

I think the problem is not actual caring breeders who sell the puppies for high prices, like who would by a 2000 usd dog and then abuse it?.

The problem in my opinion is people who are in it for a quick buck, breed their low cost bad genetics dog and create a cycle of selling them to other ""backyard breeders"".

unpopularopinion,"The main reason why people have grown to adore Disney is due to their extensive library of animation wonder that contains a grand level of charm and magic that will pass on through infinite generations, specifically their fairytale films(Pinocchio, Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast). 

Something I start to notice recently is Disney’s trend of *not so subtle* self-awareness jokes in films like Frozen, Moana, and that Princess scene in Wreck it Ralph 2. And the more I watch those films, these jokes come off as disingenuous and try-hard mainly due to the fact that they still partake in the tropes they are making fun of in the first place, rather than do something of originality to deviate from said trope. Even worse when they’re the ones who set the bar in the first place, so they try to act like they can have their cake and eat it too. 

And let’s not beat around the bush when it comes to why they’re in this direction. Shrek, as well as it’s subsequent sequels, took the absolute golden shower at Disney and their fairytales which caused a trend in the 2000s where several other films(Hoodwinked, Happily N’ever After) would follow suit. 

However, what made Shrek work were the following factors:

1. It was made by a separate company not affiliated with Disney(Dreamworks)

2. One of the founders of Dreamworks was previously in charge of Disney’s feature animation before being let go. He still held a grudge though as shown with the movie Antz coincidentally releasing around the same time as a Bug’s Life.  Basically Shrek was his big revenge plan towards defaming Disney as a brand. 

3. No other mainstream animated film dared to try shitting on Disney before Shrek, so it was both a fresh and a risky idea. 


So with those circumstances in mind, it’s ironic that Disney would try to outdo Shrek when the whole purpose of the franchise is to shit on Disney and their fairytales(as well as a personal corporate grudge) before going into their own thing, and people laugh because of the absurdity of these fairytale characters. 

Modern Disney is the fat kid people laugh at for being fat and as soon as he’s “in” on the joke, people roll their eyes and ignore him."

Catch and release (aka the 'registry') for rapists and child molesters is inhumane because it releases predators to victimize more children (and adults.) Men in general must have a soft spot for rapists and child molesters because they have created these light penalties. There is currently a media effort to make Americans feel bad about incarceration and politicians are releasing violent criminals who should be incarcerated for life. It's true that non-violent offenders should not serve lengthy sentences. It's also true that violent offenders should serve much, much longer sentences than they currently receive. They should serve many decades to keep innocent children and adults safe. Don't let the article about Finland massaging their prisoners and whispering sweet nothings in the ears make you soft on violent crime."

unpopularopinion,"When I was growing up I got my bottom smacked and got hit by the belt when I was terrible. Parents shouldn’t beat there children to a pulp, but they should learn when something in wrong or bad. Of a kid goes and takes a marker and marks an entire wall, there bottoms should be smacked. When you give a kid a slap on the wrist, it wasn’t to bad so they might do it again. You give a kid a stern talking to, they might do it again but if you smack there butt they won’t because they don’t want to get smacked again. Children who don’t get beat are the ones who run around school and yell and break rules because they never learned that they have consequences. I know I was hit by my parents, would I ever got and them for it.  No, I thank them for teaching me what consequences are. By hitting your children(to a extent) builds character and helps them distinguish right from wrong."

Their 4 year residency and 3-4 year fellowships “counts” towards the 10 years, so they go work 2-3 years at a public hospital, and they get to wash away their debt. It’s absurd .

Even people who make less, they just make minimum payments while going on vacations and eating at fancy restaurants every week. You made a commitment, you should pay back your loans. I worked hard to pay back my loans, but tons of people are just going to get it paid off for them because they are irresponsible. My taxes should not go towards this."

I've found this to be true for shows/movies that at first I thought were ok (Breaking Bad) or rather dissapointing (I'm looking at you Vikings season 5), after re watching them I realized how many details, hints and creativity were behind said shows or how lazy, cliché and a mess they were (Vikings season 5, again).
To sum it up, you're not that smart."

In a society it’s impossible for everybody to be happy. There will always be people who are upset with the conditions of the world. It will always go on like this as long as mankind exists.

Second; the meat is juicer, more flavorful and once you cook it up and chop it up it is delicious chicken morsels.

Chicken breast may look more appetizing as raw meat, but It is prone to over cooking and becomes very dry. It it’s not as good as chicken thigh."

unpopularopinion,"I see millenials complain all of the time (righteously so more often than not) about the world at large. However, many problems that I hear millenials complain about are problems that Gen XXERS have, and problems that Gen Z are obtaining. I say this mainly because millennials often express these problems like they solely belong to them while everyone else does fine. I have seen my parents (Gen X) go through all kinds of hell trying to obtain livable wages in this harsh society while my grandparents (Boomers, and one set at least. Boomers still had their struggles coming up too) had a much easier time getting money due to the world functioning differently a long time ago. I feel like they say a lot of on point things, but the things they say are far from new problems, and those things are not their problems uniquely. Frankly, the more I look back into history, I find similar concerns in a lot of generations over different things. 

Also, I do not feel like millennials are that influential or revolutionary. I feel like the advancements of the internet give them an edge over older generations (Boomers+) in terms of certain kinds of influence and connectivity, but for the most part, I don't see millenials doing anything that just blows everyone else out of the water. Although individuals like Zuckerberg are impressive, others like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Akon, etc are not exactly millenials (closer to gen X). I don't think millenials suck, I don't think they are lazy, and I don't thinknthey are dumb. I just don't think they are particularly special as a generation."
unpopularopinion,"Before everyone here goes ape shit I want to first say two things:

1) who hurt you

2) please read what I have to say before judging.

Marketing executives on Madison Avenue have known this since the 1940s. Women are not rational thinkers and are very susceptible to group pressure. In fact, this is almost concrete law in advertising, so much so that they've actually begun to market to men THROUGH women, knowing that women dangling sex in front of men can drive sales if those women demand certain things or apparel.

This is wrong because it purely exploits a woman's instinctual nature to hold together social cohesion in a group, and also dements their status seeking mentality, making them seek out things of ""status"" that marketing teams want them to view as ""status"". Pretty simple stuff.

What does this all mean? I means that women cannot be good leaders because:

1) They're easy to trick and manipulate

2) They don't have long term vision, or the logical understanding and patience to guide a society in a positive direction

3) You can confuse their internal mechanisms to the point where they don't even know who or what they are. For example, women now think that having over 50+ sexual partners before the age of 25 is ""empowering"" since ""men do it"", and they think that sucking out their 4 month old baby with a metallic tube is ""control over their body"" because a man created a pro-abortion propaganda campaign.

Basically, women are very easy to manipulate with the most basic of trickeries, whereas men are not.

Men will do appalling things to get laid, but when it comes to leadership men are not as easy to fool since it is in man's nature to lead, whether that be his family, a small group, a state, or a country. It will be the downfall of the west."

However, I do love camping and swimming in lakes in summer, along with more freedom (student) and bloomed plants. I just think people hype up summer too much.

Sure, 6 pm would be dark in one place and light in another, but it would still be 6 pm around the globe. You wouldn’t lose or gain hours by passing through manmade lines, because the time wouldn’t change. Simplify clocks around the world by removing time zones.

What do they all have in common? They're all in horizontal mode, you put your phone in a horizontal way and it makes the game just feel better to play, because your FoV isn't full of different buttons all close together, that's really annoying to see.

Playing on horizontal is so much more comfortable because your screen isn't full of buttons all of them in the same spot and barely leaving space for the game itself, and it's also easier to control since you don't have to be ultra-precise clicking a button because otherwise you're just going to click other option. Vertical mode is just so ugly to see since everything is in top of the other thing because there is no space, that sucks."

when was the last time you spent $20,000 on a dinner? to be in the same room with a political hopefull?

this is why bush kept on with clintons policies, obama kept, actually increasing bushes policies, and again trump, increasing obama policies.

what happed to bush the war criminal? or obama ""care"" is a failure?

they know they can distract you with something else, migrants, gender, antifa, comminism, unisex bathrooms, abortion debates, iran, syria, venezuela, etc, ect, and they are right.

They will say whatever the have to in order to get elected, but afterwards, they are focused on themselves, for example obama 2 million pre elected, 44 million afterwards, how that happens is none of your buisness.

You might talk about divorce, but having half your home taken and half your assets taken isn't exactly practical and if there's kids involved it's better for the kids to see the parents together than it is to see them apart. Divorce just makes things messy for the whole family and gives them a lower living standard."
unpopularopinion,"Men and Women are not the same and are not 100% equal in every aspect, both physically and mentally. Men are stronger than women and need to lift half as much to gain the same amount of muscle as women. Men have 15-22% bigger sized brains, on average. Women are slightly smarter than men on average, but men also tend to be either way above or way below the average IQ line. Sex differences in psychology are differences in the mental functions and behaviors of the sexes, and are due to a complex interplay of biological and developmental factors. 


Men are women are not completely the same and have a ton of differentiating qualities. If you were born a man and have a penis, a Y chromosome and different bone structure, you are a goddamn man. If you have ovaries, an X and a Y chromosome and a vagina, you are a goddamn woman. Period."

Nobody my age talks to each other, communicates or interacts with each other in any way. Everyone just stares at their phone. While walking, while eating at a restaurant even at school. It’s impossible for me to even connect with my friends because they’re always on their phones or watching Netflix.

That’s very scary. Nobody goes out anymore. Nobody interacts anymore. Nobody dates or has sex anymore. At every place, people are on their phones. At every home people are watching Netflix, not talking to each other.

By not showing pain and trauma they are causing more damage than by censoring iy."
unpopularopinion,But because in the statistical majority of woman have to take on the majority of child rearing it forces the pressure and or gives more opportunity for men to pursue financial success.  This gives men a false appearance of being smarter in general then women because they typically make more money.

Most of the time its being used by some misinformed, uneducated sod that is throwing in fancy words they don't understand to make themselves sound intelligent or cultured. On top of its gross misuse, it is insanely overused. We have a vast vocabulary to choose from. But people continually just read an 'advanced' word and latch onto it without actually grasping its meaning.

Why can't people take five minutes to crack open a dictionary and confirm the true definition of a word before spewing it carelessly into the wind? It's baffling."
unpopularopinion,"This also goes for parents who refuse to let their sick kids stay home from school.

You can miss some days from school or work if you are sick. Generally, it is actually more efficient and beneficial for someone who is sick to stay home so that they can recover quicker and prevent others from getting sick.

Seriously.

Parents, keep your sick brats at home before they become even more sick or get other kids sick. They probably aren't going to miss anything that they can't make up later. So what if your 9 year old misses two story times in a row? 

Bosses, stop implementing policies that only allow a certain number of sick days / forcing people to come to work sick. It won't be good for your money since your sick employee won't function at their best, and you're basically allowing all of your other employees to become sick as well. Especially of there is food involved, don't fucking let sick employees serve customers food. That's illegal and disgusting. 

Everyone, stop congratulating and encouraging people who come to school or work when they have to blow their nose every minute or are coughing everywhere. It's not heroic. Tell them to go home and get some rest."

**Revelation 13:0-18**

Revelation 13

1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.

15 And he had power to **give life unto the image of the beas**t, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or **in their foreheads:**

17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

Same with Chris Brown, people want artists to not work with him, not listen to his music and just shun from everything.  
But no matter what he did to Rihanna, his music is a completely another subject IMO.

And after this case with MLK comitting/ participating in rapes, adultery and what not I think those same people who attack the artist will defend MLK, because your stupid actions shouldnt take anything away from your good shit in life."

It's just a bunch of cryptic bullshit that suggests a narrative. This is America got touted as this ""brilliant"" music video but the song itself is pretty vapid while the actual video relies on shock value and surface level commentary. 

His acting is always cringe worthy. This guy needs some coaching or something. For example, his small role in Spiderman Homecoming. ""How can I spice up this role??? Ooo, lemme just twitch my eye.""
