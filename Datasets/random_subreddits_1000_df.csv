So I just made some good money off of litecoin. Bought quite a bit all the way down the dump and picked up a decent amount at the bottom as well. Averaged my price to about $51 per coin. 

Looking at the LTCBTC charts it looks like litecoin is doing a lot better than bitcoin and has been consistently for a while. So I‚Äôm thinking of putting half my investment into BTC as a hedge for two reasons

1) bitcoin is more stable than altcoins, and
2) bitcoin might go on a crazy run and let the alts bleed out like we see so often after the start of a bull market

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Transactions per Block at All Time High
Bitcoin,"Opened an account with them back in 2017. Had no problems trading with them, back in those days they were the only exchange with a GBP deposit option. In April 2018 they increased their [minimum deposit and withdrawal to ¬£10,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/88lcuz/coinfloor_increases_gbp_withdrawal_minimums_666/)! Basically to kick the small-time investors (like me) out. I didn't close my account just brought BTC with my remaining fiat and withdrew them from my account. 

In Jan 2019 they started accepting Faster Payment and reduced their minimum GBP deposit back to a more affordable (for me anyway) rate of ¬£1,000. Deposited ¬£1,000 and with that deposit made a total of 21 buy/sell orders within a 2 months period‚Ä¶ not really a big trader!

Everything  was fine until yesterday, on April 2, I made 2 buy orders with all my remaining fiat, just under GBP 1K. Tried to withdraw all my BTC (0.3) but the system did not accept it, I thought there was a glitch or something on their side. A few hours later I received the email below:

*""We regret to inform you that we will be closing your Coinfloor account. Upon review, we have found that the activity on your account no longer matches our risk profile. Please withdraw your remaining balance. Your account will be closed at 17:00, 03/04/2019.""*

So basically using my ¬£1000 deposit, after making 2 buys yesterday and after failed attempts to withdraws 0.3 BTC (to my own wallet), I've suddenly become a risk to them? "

Bitcoin,"Looking for an IOS wallet, which one is more reliable?"
Bitcoin,"Hi all. I want you to read all and participate in a discussion. I think it is important for the crypto industry. 

Since 2018, I'm in involved in crypto mining. I entered in a bearish market and bought my first S9s for $1500 each. Why I did that? Because I truly believed in crypto future and potential of the market. And also I understood that mining will survive only in places with cheap electricity, good internet connection, and favorable laws. 2 out 3 has my country, laws expected to be accepted until the end of 2019. So, I saw the potential and started to mine. 

After some time I and my partner decided to expand and build own facility. We bought more equipment, rented building and invested in infrastructure. At the same time, many of our friends wanted to invest in miners and asked us to host their ASICs in our place. So that's how our hosting business launched. In the following 6 months, we received a lot of interest from Japan, Korea, China, and HK. Today we have more than 20 clients from 7 different countries. 

During this period we faced a lot of challenges and became familiar with miners' problems, risks, and needs. Most places with cheap electricity are just 3rd world countries, which automatically makes them unattractive, because of many risks. Some are even on sanctions and banned to do business with. Existing miners face the problem of finding a reliable hosting place, transporting equipment, customs clearance, safety and security issues. Nevertheless, they take high risks and relocate ASICS, because doing that saves electricity costs up to 80%. 

From our side (hosting company) we face the problem of getting cheap electricity from power plants. Because they want us to invest in switch gears, transformers, cables, and other infrastructure. Also, they request us to consume more than 5 MW to get bulk prices. That's not small money. And none of our clients want to invest in this infrastructure, neither they want to wait when the facility will be ready. They want everything to be ready now. So it's not easy at all to connect all points. 

We started to think about how to make it easy for every side. How we can guarantee ROI on our investments in infrastructure and how miners can avoid complex procedure of buying, transporting ASICS and finding reliable hosting.   
First, that came to our mind is cloud mining, which perfectly solves this problem. On one side cloud mining company that sells contracts with hash rate and on other side buyers. But when we researched the contracts, it turned out that the prices are extremely high and most of such companies fraudulent. They sell the same hash rate to many different buyers, Ponzi scheme. No trust. Moreover, if cloud miner chooses a place with relatively high electricity cost ($0.05 per KWh or more) to build a data center, then it is a bankrupt business model in the long run. Because mining crypto is a harsh competition for the cheapest electricity in the world. 

Ok, what is the next alternative? We have hosting companies in 3rd world countries, we have scammy cloud mining, we have nonprofitable mining in A grade countries. All of these either risky, or pricey, or inefficient.   
We sat and discussed what we can do and found a beautiful solution. What if there is a platform, like Airbnb, where people can buy and sell hash rate just like in cloud mining. But on seller side would be individuals or companies that have access to cheap electricity and owning mining machines. And on the other side would be buyers, who want to mine crypto with the cheapest price and simplest start. With one click anyone can buy a contract and start immediately mining. 

**Why it is good for the sellers?** Firstly, sellers sell contracts in USD, which allows avoiding crypto price volatility and guarantees ROI on infrastructure and equipment. Secondly, many places with cheap electricity have not got many believers in crypto, people want to make real fiat money. Thirdly, traditional investors will be more willing to invest in complete mining projects if they offered payouts in USD and business model with concrete payback periods. 

**Why it is good for buyers?** No need to buy equipment and face a lot of risks and problems with relocating. The fast, easy and cheap way to start mining. Also good for crypto traders and investors, an additional instrument. All contracts secured by smart contracts and buyers cannot receive money until providing a full amount of hash rate. 

Forget to mention, all mining contracts will be on smart contracts. So fraud will be impossible. Buyers pay the full amount of contract in fiat, but money held and paid every 15 days to the seller after the seller delivers hash rate for this period. 

That's a basic idea and now we already started building this platform. I will be updating you guys with progress. Please follow me and participate in the discussion. Please provide your thoughts and view. Maybe you can contribute or add value to the project with your suggestions. 

And sorry for my English in case I failed to deliver an idea or misuse of language. Peace. "

Bitcoin,"I've always been skeptical of authority. 

I've always felt that authority is exercised by those least qualified to wield it. 

During the Occupy WallStreet protests we watched on as ""authority"" used violence and despotic tactics to undermine the efforts to bring the evils of the Central Banking system to light. Police and intelligence services infiltrated non-violent protest groups ; posed as protesters ; and then would instigate violence by looting, throwing rocks, etc. Authority was caught red-handed performing false-flag attacks against the Occupy Wallstreet protesters.

The narrative quickly shifted from exposing the Banking system to fighting police corruption/brutality.

Then Edward Snowden revealed and confirmed the biggest proven conspiracy to date. That the US Government was overtaken by the ""Intelligence Services"" ; that the US as a democratic, constitutional republic, no longer exists.

The leaked documents revealed that a massive Shadow government exists and has been executing a plan to monitor and have control over every aspect of every human beings life on planet Earth.

After the failure of Occupy Wallstreet many of us were livid. We didn't want to participate in this rigged game. But there was seemingly no way out. How can you fight a system that has a monopoly on the means of exchange? That has a monopoly on the concept of ""value""?

That is where Bitcoin comes in. You can't fight the monolithic system. The Central banks have the world in a mass hallucination ; they are exercising mind-control on the greatest scale humanity has ever seen. The Central banks control the behavior of humans on the planet by having a monopoly on the ideas of ""wealth"" and ""value"".

https://youtu.be/4AC6RSau7r8

You can't fight the system. Its like the Matrix; where anybody who hasn't ""woken up"" can be an ""Agent Smith"" ; fighting the system would be fighting every person who consciously or unconsciously supports the system.

The way to win; is to create a better system.

People will happily buy products at the supermarket made or harvested by slaves. They will never be convinced to do something that is ""right"" if it negatively impacts them in any way.

So we create a system that latches on to peoples sense of greed. Bitcoin will win out not because people want to overthrow the central banks en-mass; Bitcoin will win because individuals want the profit.

Bitcoin is the biggest threat of central banks and governments that has ever existed.

The source of power is peoples beliefs surrounding wealth and authority. The people have been brainwashed into believing that wealth and authority are one and the same.

People believe that for money to have value it must be issued by a government. This belief is what gives government power to issue fiat currency. Money that has value because the government says it has value.

Fiat currency is a dastardly, criminal trick perpetrated by the highest levels of ""authority""; the FED, Central Bankers, and Treasury. They are truly Rats. Bitcoin is here to end their party. As Warren Buffet puts it ""Bitcoin is like Rat Poison"". ; Bitcoin will certainly act like rat poison to the central bankers.

https://youtu.be/6n_xCI-peq0

Bitcoin proves that the value of money comes from People; not government decree.

Bitcoin proves that Central Banks are unnecessary

Bitcoin proves that intermediaries are not necessary for value transactions

Bitcoin proves that money can be global, border-less, and permission-less

Bitcoin proves that the Pen is Mightier than the sword. A significant portion of our military power is wielded to enforce economic priorities that improve the value of the USD. The US uses force and violence to create value for the USD. The USD requires a complex legal framework to prop up its value. Large sums of money are spent combating counterfeiting ; and billions in counterfeiting is gotten away with. With a few lines of code Bitcoin is entirely self-regulating. No need to use force or violence to give it value. No need to worry about counterfeiting. The system regulates and balances itself without any central authority.

Bitcoin is Law

Bitcoin is the definition of Wealth, Value, and Money

Bitcoin is Freedom

The world is malleable. We are all part of the New World Order ; its our responsibility to guide that Order in the right direction.

Bitcoin,Are there any ongoing plans or discussions on the possibility of increasing block size? Or is that a dead topic now and we're expecting some future second (or beyond) layer solutions are most definetly the best way forward as far as scalability is concerned?
Bitcoin,"It's being reported that one or maybe two people bought 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin at a synchronized time yesterday. 

We also know that over 500 million dollars of shorts was liquidated on Bitmex yesterday because of the quick price increase.

Who placed the buy orders and does it even matter? 

Was the buyer someone involved with Bitmex? 
Did he place the orders knowing that he could manipulate the price up and consequently liquidate 500 million dollars worth of shorts? 
Does this even matter? 
Maybe, maybe not. The next week will be extremely telling.

Will the large buy orders spark retail buyers to enter the market and cause another bullrun? Will this spark institutional investors to come to the table ahead of schedule because of the recent price appreciation? 
We don't know, all we can do now is wait.

Overall the only question that matters is this,
Is bitcoin in your opinion at $5,246 currently overvalued or undervalued? 
Once you decide act accordingly.

Be safe out there."

Bitcoin,"In a nutshell, it's a basically Lightning Network faucets that rewards the running of full nodes.

Here is a simplified description:

There will be a server and a client. Both run alongside a full node. Both are in the Lightning Network. The server tests the client about its knowledge of latest blocks once in a while, e.g., every time the server receives a new block. The client answers the questions by querying the Bitcoin daemon on its side. If the answer is correct, the server send some satoshis to the client via Lightning Network.

The questions must be answerable only if the client downloads full blocks. An example would be: show me 64 bytes of data starting from the beginning of the 30th transactions. They should not be answerable by only downloading block headers.

The client and its full node daemon must be online to receive the ongoing rewards.

Will it work?

It will be awesome if it works because

1. It encourages people to run full nodes.

2. It promotes Lightning Network.

3. Although it's a lie, Lightning Network has been criticized for causing centralization. Nonetheless, we can show the naysayers the opposite."

Bitcoin,"Back in 2017, I [started drawing Bitcoin price cartoons](https://cryptopop.net/tag/price/) to commemorate each new thousand dollar milestone. They were fun and people generally liked them, but we all know how the price dropped from $20,000 and proceeded to flounder for over a year. 

It now seems like I'm going to get the chance to give this a second go.

[My very first price cartoon, from 2nd of May, 2017](https://i.redd.it/v4j8dxg7w4q21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

In many ways, the climb back upwards to $20,000 (and beyond!) has felt a lot harder than the original run-up, and it's because the market actually has an ATH to measure itself against now. The first time around, we simply couldn't believe how fast and high we were flying. There was no limit to our ambitions!  /s 

&amp;#x200B;

[When Bitcoin first hit $9000 in Nov 2017, everybody made the same joke simultaneously](https://i.redd.it/37thfvbkx4q21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

But it's 2019 now and many have found their belief in crypto shaken by the long winter. We've lost so many of the so-called ""weak hands"" of 2017, and that term portrays them as players who need to leave the table in order for serious parties to take control. In my mind though, it's equally likely that they simply didn't understand what they were getting into and just couldn't take such huge losses. 

Many people don't fully understand what they're getting into when they first try something that looks interesting; they learn through experience. That's how I got into crypto back in 2014, but I have a big advantage over the 2017 newbies because I'd already lived through one crypto winter.

I know a lot of my friends were like this, and they now simply refuse to look at any crypto market because they were so burned by 70% losses. I feel bad for them, of course, and I want them all to come back in time to see some decent gains. I'm doing that passively now though, through the art. Every time they see my work on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/helloluis), [FB](https://facebook.com/cryptopop), or [IG](https://instagram.com/cryptopop), it's a subtle reminder to reconsider their opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

When I go in and check the wallet balances there is an amount labeled ""remote"" that matches the Satoshis I've spent on games and what not on the lightning network itself so that part makes sense.  There's another column labeled ""commitment fees"" that's a number I don't quite understand.  I haven't tracked it super closely but my total showing for Satoshis is going down so looks like that ""commitment fees"" column is going up and getting bigger.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what that's about exactly?  I figured if you put money into a channel it could just sit and only would change if / when you send money to some kind of service but maybe I don't understand it properly?

So, we have been having an issue withdrawing money from Bitfinex. Our two fiat withdrawals worth 40,000 USD have been stuck there for over a month now. We have a corporate account with Bitfinex, fully verified, been a client for 1.5 years.

After trying to get the withdrawals sent to our bank for a month, we posted a series of posts on social media and soon enough, Bitfinex said they will refund the withdrawals back to our account. 

During that month they delivered 10X times worth of EUR withdrawals to the same bank account without any issue, so I assumed they are just having issues with USD again and are ""saving face"" by giving us the ""concern of your account activity"" excuse. Great! We thought we can withdraw in crypto and convert to fiat and get it to our bank via a different channel. But 24 hours later the funds have not been credited back yet, so we inquired with the support yet again and here was their reply.

Ok, we thought, since we are in Asia, it's probable that the admin is in the US somewhere and they will credit it during our night time. Buuuut 3 days have passed and the funds have not been credited back yet. So I am pretty sure that 3 days covers all the existing time zones on planet earth, so I guess either Bitfinex admin is working from another planet or they are just trying to keep our money hoping that we will let it go. Since then we have sent another 10 emails to support. So far, all have been left without any answers. Maybe the support is still hungover from celebrating Aprils Fools day or as it is known in Bitfinex ""Our Customer day"".   


Last time we started posting things on social media platforms, we got some responses. We're hoping this will have the same effect as last time by posting again. "

Bitcoin,"Hello everyone,  


I'm a highly successful trader/fund manager from Iran. and in this post I want to share some useful info with you guys about the educational courses on trading.  I'm going to explain how most educators scam the students out of their money without *technically* scamming them. so even if you are not looking for an educational course, I believe you should still read this post as it can give you a clear view of the education market in trading.   


 ok, lets get into it..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I  have taken a lot of online trading courses in my time, and while I  have learned at least one valuable lesson from each of them, a simple  vetting of their teachings showed me that their methods were more often  than not very flawed.  
The worst ones would effectively destroy your  account over the long haul and the good ones (and I‚Äôm using the term  ‚Äúgood‚Äù loosely here) could only make your account a profitable account  if you were trading with an EA and over a period longer than 5 years!

  
**There is a significant amount of hidden truths in the world of trading education.**

  
Most educators out there aren‚Äôt necessary lying when they tell you that their trading strategy *works*!

but your definition of what ‚Äúworks‚Äù, often times significantly differs from what they mean by the word ‚Äúworks‚Äù.

to  any new-comer to trading, a trading system/strategy that ‚ÄúWorks‚Äù is a  trading system/strategy that can be used in a specific time frame, and  deliver positive gain with limited risk.

so  for example, they usually expect to open any number of trading  positions in a given period, lets say a month, and at the end of the  month, close that basket of trades and overall, turn a profit.

that‚Äôs what you want to be doing as a trader, isn‚Äôt it? make money instead of losing it?

but  what most educators don‚Äôt tell you is that when they say a strategy  works, it almost always means that it has showed a positive gain when  they have put the strategy through back-testing.

now what is backtesting? here is the definition from investopedia:

&gt;***Backtesting*** is the general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post  
*Backtesting* assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If *backtesting* works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward

You  get the idea.. it basically means that they use computers to see that  if someone had been trading with this strategy since years ago till  today, would that trading account be in profit today? and if the answer  is yes, then they will count that strategy as something that works.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now this is where the waters start to get a bit murky!**

Backtesting  is a process that you define the parameters of it yourself. while there  often is a consensus over what those parameters should be set to in  order to create legitimate and trustworthy results, often times,  educators deliberately back-test a strategy in a way to mask its  inefficiencies. so for example, lets say you have a strategy that  requires you to hold trading positions for a months at a time‚Ä¶. you  back-test it properly and you will see that it wont work if used in the  market due to the swap rates or other fees that will destroy your  supposed gains from the trades themselves.. now how can you make that  useless strategy a working one? ignore those fees in your back-testing.  that doesn‚Äôt quite cut it? hell with it, lets average the spread around  to make it work.

now  you might ask yourself, ‚Äúwhy would anyone even bother mess with their  own backtesting?‚Äù and the answer is simple, because if they can get a  back-testing that is showing proper results, no matter how faulty that  backtesting process is, it still gives them legal grounds to claim they  haven‚Äôt committed fraud when saying their strategy ‚Äúworks‚Äù, it would be  just a matter of an error in calculations that could happen to anyone!

Also,  a lot of times, they don‚Äôt even need to manipulate the data that much.  they can pick one of the strategies that shows positive gains when  back-testing, and market it as something that its not.

So  lets say you have back-tested a strategy over 8 years of data and you  have jumped through all the hoops and have made sure your strategy is  sound and can be still deployed going forward.

now  what most educators do is that they hide the pieces of truth that they  deem are irrelevant to the topic. because after all, they just said that  the trading strategy works, which is technically true. but what they  chose not to tell you is that the fact that a trading strategy can show  profits in backtesting, is not enough for it to be a useful method for  retail traders.

why?  because for that strategy to show a positive gain, it had to be used on  every trading opportunity on the chart (based on the strategy‚Äôs rules)  so at the end of the test, the combined result of all those trading  positions can generate a profit.

that  means, that if you take that strategy and use it in a shorter  time-period, and miss a couple of trading opportunities here and there,  you are no longer on the same path as that back-testing, you are in a  whole new territory and chances are you won‚Äôt be able to generate  profits or the profits generated could be significantly less than what  you had imagined.

**This  is what most educators hide from you, because their livelihood depends  on you not knowing how they are manipulating the truth.**

They are not all fraudsters, but almost all of them are half-truthers!

And  the saddest part of all this is that they often manage to charge people  significant amounts of money in order to teach them something that  won‚Äôt help them in their trading. so they take a strategy and package it  in some nice flare and market it as a ‚Äúquick-fix‚Äù for anyone desperate  enough to pay for it, and they pocket the money while you end up losing  yours to the market.

often  times, they encourage students to stay the hell away from lower time  frames charts and stick to trading 8 hour or daily charts. the reason  for that is that using higher time frame charts, makes the ‚Äúrealization  process‚Äù a lot longer.   
so it will actually take the students months  or often years before they figure out that the method they have paid a  lot of money for, doesn‚Äôt work.

And  the even sadder part is that by this time, the educator often chalks up  the whole thing to the market ‚Äúevolving‚Äù which has rendered the  strategy useless now.

So  you end up back on the first square, scammed out of your hard earned  money while achieving nothing in the process and god forbid, incurring  more losses in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

[I‚Äôm a highly successful day trader](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bahman-RasoulPour-Linorth). 

  
Last  year, I broke the record of Michael Burry (the guy shoring the US  housing market in 2008) by achieving 783% of profit in 11 days of  trading, with a drawdown of only 11.51% [\[\*\]](https://linorth.com/)   
I  did that live, in front of my followers in my telegram channel.  manually entering and exiting 806 trading positions during that 11 day  period. managing to turn $2500 into $17000.  
And if you want to see my  performance during the last 3 years of running my telegram channel, you  can visit it and check it out by scrolling to the old posts. (link is  in my website)  
if I  wanted to scam people out of their money, I could have easily create a course and attach that trade explorer to it and make a boatload of money  off of it. but I didn‚Äôt.   
you know why? because I knew there is not a  quick-fix strategy for achieving that level of success in trading. 

  
I was one of the few traders insisting on shorting Bitcoins on 20 Feb 2018, here is the analysis I had on it when the market was still showing an strong upward move!

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/wlBJSNaQ-BTCUSD-Daily/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/wlBJSNaQ-BTCUSD-Daily/)

  
and here is my signal for going long again 3 months ago at 3500 price level!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really good at my job and I have the evidence to back that claim up.   
in  order to become a profitable trader (and by profitable I mean a trader that wins more trades than he loses in any given time-period  -wins&gt;losses-) you need to first understand the market itself, and  learn how it functions and then learn how to distinguish between a  high-probability trading opportunity and a low probability one, so you  can effectively become profitable in your trading, and from there, its  only a matter of calibrating your entries better to increase your  profitability beyond what those so-called educators tell you is  impossible.

  
After about 2 years of people sending me messages asking me to teach  them how to trade, I‚Äôve very recently decided to run my own [Mentorship Program](https://linorth.com/mentorship-program/).

I  believe its the best course out there, Because unlike all the other trading educators out there, I don‚Äôt like doing my education on old  charts that have already played out and everyone can see where the price  has moved to. 

Most educators offer a course that explains everything on an old chart and when it comes to live trading in real  time, all they do is basically giving two sided advice and no real  direction or a tangible process of assessing the market conditions in  real time for making trading decisions.   
but I like to do most of my  teaching live in real time in a more hands on approach so my students  can watch their mentor implement the method live in real time and learn  to do it themselves on their own.

The  registration is limited to 100 students because the mentorship program includes a private 1-1 session with each and every student so I can  personally guide them in their education process and help them in  absorbing the information of the course as well as its implementation  live in real time in the market.

I  don‚Äôt offer a quick-fix strategy to fix all your trading problems, what  I do offer is a chance to have a professional trader guide you on your  trading journey and help you get to a place where you can assess the market conditions and make trading decisions all on your own based on sound logic and nothing else.   


The program is 3 months long and costs only $499.

  
During  the 3 months of the program you will also get 3 months of free access  to my trading floor which normally costs $99 per month on top of the  course.   
That makes the price of the program itself about $200!   


The course is honestly very heavily undervalued.

I  personally spent about $2K on my education in the first year for a  mentorship program that lasted only 2 months and was overall 8 classes  lasting 3 hours each and it only covered basics plus some pattern  trading!  
and over the years I have spent over $10K on various trading  books and courses online and have absorbed all that information and  have put the best parts of each of those courses together to create my  own method and now I‚Äôm giving all of the best parts bundled up together  for an affordable fee!  
Most traders lose a lot of money with trial  and error of methods that doesn‚Äôt work, so if you are one of them or  don‚Äôt want to become one, now is your chance to have someone who is  already making money from the market teach you how its done.

I  personally have spent way more money on courses that I only hoped might  add 2% to my ROI, because even if it thought me something that could  add even a small percentage to my ROI, over the long haul it would pay  for itself.  
so think of the mentorship as an investment in your own future as a trader.

Bitcoin,"Are you a Bitcoin (or cryptocurrency)  investor/trader and worried about calculating gains for taxation? If  yes, I have very good solutions for you - Excel Calculators based on  FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out) methods.

""Bitcoin Cryptocurrency FIFO Gain Excel Calculator for Taxation"" is a very  easy-to-use, handy Excel sheet for calculating the gains in Bitcoin and  other crypto trading using FIFO method.

Spreadsheet  is ready to calculate FIFO gains up to 2000 transactions, which can  easily be extended further by dragging the formulas as per your  requirement.

Sheet automatically  highlights the rows for Buy and Sell transactions in Green and Orange  colors so user can easily identify a Buy or sell transaction.

The  tool is ready to calculate gains for 5 coins (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash,  Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple) and summary of these gains is shown in  ""Summary"" sheet. User can copy or rename these sheets for other  cryptocurrencies as well.

![img](cn1ts63397q21 ""Bitcoin Cryptocurrency FIFO Gain Excel Calculator for Taxation"")

You  will just have to put your trading details i.e. Transaction Type (buy  or sale), Date &amp; Time of Transaction, Bitcoin Quantity in columns A  to D and sheet will automatically calculate FIFO gains and other  important data for every row. You will see Gain or Loss after every  transaction on FIFO basis in column U. Besides this, spreadsheet will  also show you other important data e.g. Cumulative Cost of Bitcoin  Purchased, Cumulative Earning from Sell of Bitcoin, Total Bitcoin  Purchased, Total Bitcoin Sold, Bitcoin in Hand after every transaction.

Columns  P, Q, R and S contain formulas for calculating costs of coins sold in  parts. These formulas are complex and doing the calculation on FIFO  method. These contain intermediate results. You may show or hide them as  per your choice.

You can set exchange commission for buy or sell transaction in 2 ways:

First  method is to set a fixed percentage for all Buy and Sell transactions  in cells B1 and B2. It will be used to fill amount of commission (in $)  for each transaction in column F and remove values from column E.

In  second method you can manually fill amount of variable commission (in  $) for each transaction in column E. In that case, value in column F  will NOT be used by sheet.

Formula to  calculate Effective Price after Commission in column G will first look  for commission amount in column E. If it is blank, then commission  amount from column F will be used (which itself is derived from %age  values from cells B1 and B2).

You can adopt both the methods together, but remember that value in column E always takes precedence over column F.

You  can purchase this tool from Eloquens.com marketplace for USD $10 only.  LIFO (Last in First Out) and Google Sheet versions are also available.

Implications  for your due taxes would be significant, depending upon the choice you  make (either FIFO or LIFO methods). I hope that after comparing the  gains using the FIFO and LIFO methods, you will be in a better position  to minimize your tax implications, save time, and maximize your gains.

Bitcoin,"Just to give everyone the heads up that Coinmama is ripping people of.I have done several trades on Coinmama until 11 days ago when i went to purchase ¬£400 worth of coins.for some strange reason the order  failed even though there was plenty of funds to make the payment[. ](https://payment.Now)Now my bank shows the money as pending so i contacted Coinmama 3 times now and have been told to give my bank a code they gave me to release the pending funds hold on my money.After spending a long time on the phone to try get them to sort it out there response eventually was they dont have a clue what i am on about with this code and there is nothing they can do as they say Coinmama has my money and Coinmama say the bank that has it so the bank can not release the funds as Coinmama has them.I have now e,mailed customer support for the 4th time explaining what the bank said and guess what now they do not reply.They will try tell you the site is safe to use but believe me its far from safe as im now down ¬£400 which i can not get back so be very careful if using Coinmama as it will only be a matter of time before it happens to everyone.This seems to be quite a common problem with several bitcoin exchange sites and  they do what others call selective scams as they just do random hits on people and then do lots of genuine deals then scam someone again but because they do so many genuine deals in between scamming the odd person everyone thinks its a 100% safe to trade on so just be very cautious if trading on Coinmama."

You have received this email because you are a user of the Bitcoin exchange provided by MtGox Co., Ltd. (‚ÄúMtGox‚Äù) who did not file a proof of rehabilitation claim(s) under the civil rehabilitation proceedings for MtGox (the ‚ÄúCivil Rehabilitation Proceedings‚Äù).

On March 15, 2019, the Rehabilitation Trustee approved or disapproved rehabilitation claims regarding MtGox Bitcoin exchange users‚Äô rights to make claims against MtGox for return of cash or cryptocurrency, and submitted to the Tokyo District Court a statement of approval or disapproval.

Although you did not file a proof of rehabilitation claim(s) under the Civil Rehabilitation Proceedings, we found a remaining balance in your account on the MtGox database. This remaining balance was approved by the Rehabilitation Trustee as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s), which is a rehabilitation claim that the Rehabilitation Trustee needs to approve pursuant to the Civil Rehabilitation Act if it is aware of its existence.

However, on March 28, 2019, certain rehabilitation creditors who filed their proofs of rehabilitation claim objected to your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s). In order to preserve your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) under the Civil Rehabilitation Proceedings, you need to file a claim assessment procedure for your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) with the Tokyo District Court by no later than May 7, 2019 (Japan Time) (date of arrival). If you do not file a claim assessment procedure for your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) by May 7, 2019, you will lose your rights as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s).

If you wish to file a claim assessment procedure, please reply to this email and state the sentence below in the body of your reply. Please note that we will not accept your reply sent from an email address different from the email address that received this email.

‚ÄúI wish to file a claim assessment procedure for my rehabilitation claim(s) to which an objection was made.‚Äù

If we receive your reply containing the above sentence, the Rehabilitation Trustee will send you an email showing the amount of your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) and describing how to file a claim assessment procedure, along with a PDF form of the application.

If you do not wish to file a claim assessment procedure, you do not have to take any action. However, as mentioned above, please note that you will lose your rights as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s).

If you talk about Bitcoin in a bear market they will take one look at the chart and say they are not buying that. An asset that looks like its trending toward zero is not a compelling story.

But, When the trend reverses not only is the risk to purchase for the first time favorable, the chart can help the narrative in persuading skeptical normies. **Now is the optimal time**. Do we want as many regular people involved in Bitcoin as possible? Or are we going to let the institutions gobble up all the cheap Bitcoin? This can only be done by word of mouth. Everyday, tell a new person about Bitcoin. You job is not to convert them. Only leave an impression. Marketers say a person need 6 independent impressions before they engage with a new idea. So if you get the usual response (that's drug money, it wastes energy...) don't argue with them as your job is already done. You are not to convert everyone you speak to, only bring the topic mind to their mind.

So stop wasting time here talking to other Bitcoiners. Go out to other corners of the internet and subtlety drop Bitcoin into the conversation. Go to r/askredddit and give Bitcoin the answer to their question. Or talk about the inadequacies of the central banking system. Just do something.

During the last few days it has dropped to 238.xxx, then, a day later to 230.xxx and now it's at 227.853.

Wtf is this? I haven't set a channel fee and don't have another channel open. So, the way I understand the channel system NOTHING should be happening?

On March 15, 2019, the Rehabilitation Trustee approved or disapproved rehabilitation claims regarding MtGox Bitcoin exchange users‚Äô rights to make claims against MtGox for return of cash or cryptocurrency, and submitted to the Tokyo District Court a statement of approval or disapproval.

Although you did not file a proof of rehabilitation claim(s) under the Civil Rehabilitation Proceedings, we found a remaining balance in your account on the MtGox database. This remaining balance was approved by the Rehabilitation Trustee as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s), which is a rehabilitation claim that the Rehabilitation Trustee needs to approve pursuant to the Civil Rehabilitation Act if it is aware of its existence.

However, on March 28, 2019, certain rehabilitation creditors who filed their proofs of rehabilitation claim objected to your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s). In order to preserve your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) under the Civil Rehabilitation Proceedings, you need to file a claim assessment procedure for your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) with the Tokyo District Court by no later than May 7, 2019 (Japan Time) (date of arrival). If you do not file a claim assessment procedure for your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) by May 7, 2019, you will lose your rights as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s).

If you wish to file a claim assessment procedure, please reply to this email and state the sentence below in the body of your reply. Please note that we will not accept your reply sent from an email address different from the email address that received this email.

‚ÄúI wish to file a claim assessment procedure for my rehabilitation claim(s) to which an objection was made.‚Äù

If we receive your reply containing the above sentence, the Rehabilitation Trustee will send you an email showing the amount of your self-approved rehabilitation claim(s) and describing how to file a claim assessment procedure, along with a PDF form of the application.

If you do not wish to file a claim assessment procedure, you do not have to take any action. However, as mentioned above, please note that you will lose your rights as a self-approved rehabilitation claim(s).

He has people working round the clock and accounts for 80% of Crypto trade volume today. His programmers are all native English speakers working around the clock. A crack team of 5 key persons working in the Philippines, Singapore, Germany and Amsterdam.

He shared some of his graphs and we went back to his offices and he showed me a live trade. I must say I am very impressed with his work. Adam showed me the secret to his success.

He is a veteran trader of the Crypto Space and there is no one more qualified to speak on these matters than him.

Bitcoin,"It's time again to reiterate the importance of taking physical possession of all of your Bitcoin by controlling your own private keys ASAP. This goes for the smallest holders with mere dollars worth of bitcoin, all the way up to people with millions and more worth of bitcoin. If we continue to leave our satoshis on these exchanges which are backed by the largest Banks that have obvious conflict of interest with respect to Bitcoin's success, then we will continue to allow those entities to dictate the price of Bitcoin in dollars. They will do this through a variety of techniques they have been employing over the last couple of years. Specifically what they will continue to do is use over-the-counter markets (OTC) combined with cash-settled futures as well as rehypothecation tactics with the bitcoin currently stored on their exchanges to manipulate the price of our currency.  Remember it doesn't matter how much or little  that you have since cumulatively these Satoshis add up to billions of dollars worth of bitcoin that people simply leave on these exchanges that gives these exchanges control of the largest Bitcoin wallets in the world.  While I do believe that over time we will be victorious, it will take the education of the masses of the basic truths that supply and demand determines value, that bitcoin is the first truly finite asset, what bitcoin is and how to take possession, coupled with the willingness to move their Bitcoin off these exchanges.   Once critical mass does occurs where the faithful dollar cost average folks that also hold their own keys outweigh the currently corned markets of the exchanges, is when we will  have our peaceful revolution and let bitcoins true price discovery begin. Until then we will be at the mercy of the banks that currently control the bitcoin market.

I've grown used to crypto volatility, but seeing Tether rival Bitcoin for a bit of time... it appears that this stablecoin was severely underestimated before

&amp;#x200B;

**Mansoor**24 days ago

As Tether becomes more influential and powerful, it becomes capable of undermining Bitcoin's dominance, thus we should be prepared for unexpected market changes

&amp;#x200B;

**Amine**24 days ago

Maybe Tether is not so cool for every trader, but it doesn‚Äôt make it scam ‚Äì ordinary stablecoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Michael**24 days agothe facts speaks louder than emotions, guys, tether is in trend now, we can do nothing with that.  


**mido**24 days ago

I don‚Äôt hold negative position about USDT as it has done nothing criminal. It‚Äôs just one more stablecoin that I will proly use some day.

&amp;#x200B;

**andrei**24 days ago

It is still rather hard for me to believe that Tether was on par with Bitcoin was a period of time, this stablecoin is surely full of tricks up its sleeve

&amp;#x200B;

**Lok him**24 days agoI can understand those who grew tired of crypto with its scammery and I relate to that, this is why I chose to focus on Tether for the time being, it's not affiliated with any despicable activity

Bitcoin,"Don't hand wave. Tethers are still highly suspect (I guess some of you were convinced by image of a letter from a bank saying they have tether's money, in weird phrasing and signed by no one.)

@Bitfinexed on twitter posts about new tethers being printed, which is normal, and also frozen, which is unusual. Shenanigans = maybe something is afoot in tetherland? Recent pump couple days ago may have been big players EXITING tethers into BTC. I mean how else do you dump a lot of USDT? Tether won't redeem it, and the books for USDT/USD are rather thin.

Assuming tether implodes it may take down bitfinex with it, which is a big exchange even if they don't serve US customers anymore. This will be a market event of outsize proportions.

TLDR: Consider withdrawing everything from USDT trading exchanges, especially bitfinex. Maybe even avoid fiat withdrawals, just go with whatever coin you like for an immediate transfer."

Well, everyone, it's that season again (and yeah, I know it gets earlier and earlier with each passing 4 years).

Malls across America, Europe, and Asia are now looking for qualified candidates to play Satoshi Nakamoto from now until Halving Day. We are looking for professionals who:

\-Are good with children (and grown men whose eyes are glazed over from staring at the price on a screen)

\-Are able to put in a full 8-hour shift (increasing to as long as 11 hours in the last month before the halving).

\-Are physically well enough to sit, stand, and hold people on their knee.

Your job responsibilities will include:

\-Questioning children and adults about what they have done, over the past four years, to help dismantle the legacy financial system.

\-Answering THEIR questions about the fundamentals of Bitcoin.

\-Promising them a happy and prosperous halving.

\-Smiling for pictures taken by their parents or embarrassed wives.

A familiarity with the lore surrounding Halving Day is a bonus. You should at least be able to regurgitate the basic tenet that it is the one day every four years when Satoshi halves the inflation rate of good cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and doubles the inflation rate of naughty currencies that collude with banks.

As the season now runs longer than a year, you may be expected to double up as a Mall Santa during the November-December months.

Positions are also open for Satoshi's helpers, who will be playing early Bitcoin developers, as well as for the position of Mrs. Nakamoto, which will be a managerial position among the helpers who will direct their efforts at crowd control and queue management.

To apply, submit your resume and cover letter at the employment office of any mall. We will call you if you meet our qualifications. Pay will be in your local fiat currency.

Happy Halving!"

Bitcoin has surged again, one of very important reasons may be China's CSO. what's the CSO? Colleteralized Stock Obligation. Oh wait, does it look like that shit CDO in 2007? Yes, totally. Even though China is not going to give this financial operation a name like CSO, since CDO has been given a sign of shit, it still can not cover up that CSO is a shadow, a duplication of CDO.
Did Chinese securities company know CSO is a shit? Yes! Did Chinese highest level of department like CSRC or President Xi know CSO is a shit? No! See, there was a impeccable opportunity to manipulate this business behind the the scenes for communism.
There're very strict rules to sell stock for the majority shareholders in China, technically to say, it's not easy to sell your shares in the public stock market if you're one of the majority shareholders. Then how much does CSO help the majority shareholders make money from 2017 to 2018? About 3 trillion RMB or 447 billion US dollors in total.
China's real estate is the most expensive in the World, can I buy a house in other country? No! CSRC or president Xi may know I was playing monkey business behind their back in the pass two years, can I exchange my property into US dollor and run away? the limit of exchange is 50 grand per year for one person, 10 million? no way.
Then any way to jail break? Bitcoin or other encrypted currency are at your serivce, China's surveillance is not working here. Now let me ask you a question when China's kinda illegal rich people know they can buy Bitcoin or other encrypted currency to escape from this country, what will the value of bitcoin go? up or down?"

Bitcoin,"Hello,

this is to warn users not to deposit fiat or crypto to the the Latin Ameriacan  exchange Bitinka under any cirucumstances or you may not be able to ever withdraw it.....

Over the past month this has been my experience with using Bitinka:

1.First I get an email from Bitinka on 27th February saying that Fiat withdrawals will soon be  disabled  for the coming weeks whilst ""they implement a change to their withrawal processor"" (and still are of course)but that you can still deposit Fiat and you can deposit and withdraw crypto. I got a little bit suspicious when I note the email sent to notify me of this was about 38 mins before the suspension of fiat withdrawal due to start‚Ä¶..Hmmmm 

2. Then when  I try and buy some XRP and withdraw it, it doesn't work and I get a message saying:
‚Äúwe inform you that xrp withdrawals are disabled temporary on our platform‚Äù

3. I have no choice but to sell them back again into my Euros and I make a loss on that because of the large spreads. 

4. So I think well no problem,  I'll buy some bitcoin and I'll withdraw that. I mean out of all the crypto currencies they have on there you MUST be able to withdraw bitcoin surely.
After all in the email it said only fiat  you cannot withdraw, cryptos are fine so you must be able to withdraw BTC afterall it is the biggest, must just be  a problem with just xrp as they say, hopefully at least..

So,  I try and go through the process of withdrawing a  small amount of BTC as a tester and this time I get a message saying it is ‚Äúon hold‚Äù I cancel it several times and start again but after many hours it is always the same.
This stays this way for over 24hrs I look on their website it says if any problems with withdrawing last longer than 24 hours to contact them so I contact them.

They get back to me and say the following excuse:

‚ÄúDear user,

we inform you that your withdrawal has not been due to a problem with the node of the platform, once solved we will be informing you. Thank you for your understanding.‚Äù

Now I start getting angry and threaten to start alerting media/social media etc if they do not let me withdraw btc immediatley OR if they try and block my account.(which they have done to other users I since found out)

and....next time I log in  they have blocked my account! 
A message appears on the screen saying 
""Dear user we inform you that your account is blocked""

Since then I have contacted them via Twitter, DM on Twitter, email their facebook page and the answer is always the same ie 
""we will be in contact soon"" or something similar , or better still an reply to my email saying ""please reply to the new support ticket""which of course I cannot because I cannot log in to view said support ticket, which they know full well as they are the ones who blocked my account and is the reason why I have contacted them and so on and so on.

I have taken sreenshots along the way and have evidence of the entire process. I was thinking of putting them all in here on this post but could not figure out how to attach them, maybe if someone wants to help I can put them on here, or I can email you them if you want to see it all, let me know.

So, I have approx 2000 euros sitting in my account which I cannot access, at least at the moment unless they dramatically change their tune somehow,  And I am not the only one apparently. (I can provide more links os other users similar experiences)

So please DO NOT deposit any money or crypto with this exhange or you will not be able to withdraw it if you do.

Strange thing is how legitimate they  make themselves look, I mean the exchange itself works fine, you can buy and sell on there, they have great fiat pairings, which is what attracted me in 1st place, and they send you informative emails about all things crypto etc. So why on earth on they even bothering to scam people when they could just go ahead and...you know run a successful exchange and make loads of money/be successful.

And  here is the cherry on the cake, get this,
Roger Benites CEO and co founder of Bitinka exchange is this weekend Saturday 6th April and Sunday 7th April  appearing as a speaker at the Teamz  Blockchain Summit in Tokyo and guess what is the title of his talk?
You are not going to believe this it is called:

""Fighting Hackers: How to Protect Users Funds""
see the following link and in the ""overview"" if you scroll down you will see Roger Benites featuring as a speaker with said talk
[urhttps://summit.teamz.co.jp]

Oh the irony!

Well if anyone has some creative ideas of how I might get this sorted out somehow please reply, 

I know one thing for sure, I will never give up till I die on getting my funds back, this for me is alot of money, I am unable to work as I have a chronic medial condtion so it's not like I can just forget about it and move on.

Bitcoin,"Let's call Bullshit on Binance for not supporting SegWit in the only way that they will notice.

**Boycott Binance until SegWit.**

The anti-SegWit decision by the world‚Äôs biggest exchange **contributes** unnecessarily to enormous mempool spikes and fees such as what happened a few days ago.

Here are reasons that Binance are anti-SegWit:

* a preference for crypto to remain on exchange rather than be withdrawn. Small transaction adjustments have large effects on behaviour.
* to create value for their Binance BNB token relative to other tokens like Bitcoin.
* more reasons to support the Token Launch Platform / Binance Launchpad to solve problems by first generation currencies like Bitcoin.
* people much smarter than me will add to this list no doubt.

Let‚Äôs relentlessly start posting and liking and generally getting pissed at Binance about lack of SegWit support!

Bitcoin,"Following the recent success of BitTorrent and MultiVAC's IEO, it seems that there is a huge interest in IEOs as they seem to be extremely profitable. MultiVAC's IEO finished today where they raised $3.6m in less than 7 seconds and is currently trading OTC at 8x ROI of the purchase price already.

The main issue with IEOs at the moment is the fact that bots have a monopoly on them. Within those 7 seconds, the vast majority of the participants were bot accounts thus not allowing real humans to have a chance of entering.

Other than that, the caps tend to be incredibly low with upcoming IEO Matic Network having a cap of only $350 per participant.

The only way to tackle these issues and still profit greatly off IEOs are getting access to private sales where your allocation is secured (meaning that you don't have to fight against bots to get your allocation in) and be given a significantly larger cap than the crowdsale investor.

Bitcoin," After a not-so brief discussion on twitter with blockstream developer Christian Decker, he blocked me without fully mitigating my concerns. So I'm here on reddit to try and figure out where I am wrong.

Here is the scenario:

3 people, Alice, Bob and Charlie are going to create a multi-party channel, and Alice and Bob are going to collude to defraud Charlie.

\-After creating the multi-party channel, Alice and Bob create a p2p lightning channel with most of their bitcoins. Charlie, trusting Alice and Bob as they are all old friends, signs off on this state. Either Bob or Alice stores this state as a backup.

\-In a future state Alice and Bob close that p2p lightning channel and both open channels with Charlie.

\-Both users buy some physical goods from Charlie (he sells cookies).

Now:

\- Either Alice or Bob rolls back their node and tries to submit the saved state with their bitcoins in a channel with each other.

As I understand it, if Alice submits the state and Charlie disputes it, she will have to wait 1000-blocks, and Charlie has the signatures to claim his original bitcoin, and attempt to steal alice's bitcoin, because she was naughty.

However, in the commited state, her funds are locked in a new multisig wallet with Bob. Therefore Charlie has no option to steal Alice's bitcoin, and as Bob has not signed an old state, Charlie cannot touch his bitcoin either.

It seems to me that this resolves in Alice and Bob sharing all of their bitcoin and Charlie's cookies, and Charlies walks away cookieless with only his opening bitcoin balance.

OK, started Bitcoin-core client, with an already synced data folder. Empty bitcoin.conf (none of guides says how to configure the conf file).  
Wait until the client is full synced. And then launched the windows-node-launcher (from a subfolder inside Bitcoin folder).  
All good, started slowly and a small popup appeared in systray saying Bitcoin node is syncing.  
Reviewed the config of Bitcoin and LND through that little app in systray and saw that bitcoin.conf was already filled with some settings. Didn't change anything.  
After 1 day (with the bitcoin blockchain already synced), the systray popup still says that is syncing and have a red dot.  
In the tutorial says that we have to leave it to sync until is blue and then green.

Bitcoin,"The recent mempool spike reminds us it can be expensive to spend dusty BTC when fees rise. Today could be a good opportunity to do some defragmenting at 1 sat/byte - ideally into a segwit address. The bottom one of [JoHoe's three excellent charts](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2h) shows if the mempool is emptying and if 1 s/b transactions are getting mined. Be wary of wallets auto-setting unnecessarily high fees.

It's worth remembering that even if all your BTC is in one single address it could still be very fragmented: if you receive 100 payments into an address you've got 100 fragments. Make one transaction to send the whole contents of that address to a new address in your wallet and the new address will contain just one lump of BTC. 

Consistently low fees up until the last couple of weeks have perhaps lulled us into thinking fees would never rise again so why bother defragging: the [UTXO has reached an all-time high](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/utxo-count?timespan=2years).
So if your stash is a bit dusty, now could be the time to defrag just in case fees are high when you come to make that spend or want to move some BTC into Lightning.

***ATTENTION THERE IS NO SATOSHI***

&gt;I created ""The Vision of Satoshi"" &amp; Blockchain concept in 2008 when I was 17. I was brought into the ""Bitcoin Project"" &amp; secured the network with my Paper-Chain concept.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Where there is NO Satoshi that is a point of view not a person! The persons name for bringing me into the project is ""Chuck"" or ""Tim""   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Myself being ""Lucas"" &amp; ""Tim"" created the vision of the network within two hours during a conversation!   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;For example we created the point of 21 Million coins, how Bitcoin Mining works, &amp; what I call the ""Paper-Chain"" that became Blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin without the Blockchain is that of another data transfer service even if the data represents money . The project would have just been another PayPal Or transfer service as an intermediate for goods and services meaning virtual security for Money.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin &amp; Blockchain are not the same, there was a day when Bitcoin was going to be released without the Blockchain as I created this vision through my own thoughts. I have never wrote a single line of Bitcoin or Blockchain code!

&amp;#x200B;

1. I tried to login to my account this last year around the 10 year mark for myself, April 5th is my real birthday. I was adopted &amp; all i really know about myself is that of my birthday. For this reason all you really know about ""Satoshi"" is his birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***My vision of Blockchain 2.0 &amp; Unlimited Energy by way of a mechanical machine is ready. Also the Blockchain 2.0 is based on a ""SuperNode"" concept where instant transfers &amp; new markets will be created without ""Forking"" any code.***

***My name is Lucas I created ""Satoshi""***

&amp;#x200B;

*""Anyone who can prove they created ""Bitcoin"" not ""Satoshi"" or ""Blockchain"" will have the login information and source files along with project files like ""draft"" version of ""Vision of Satoshi"". I was given a 12 word key in 2008 for my work towards the ""Bitcoin Project' I waited about 10 years to login to my account. For the reason ""Natural Market Progression"" I stayed clear of Bitcoin, CryptoCurrency. I have watched many try and take credit for ""Blockchain"" because my I.P. changed the world many years later!*

&amp;#x200B;

* **My story is titled ""The Real Story Of Satoshi"" by Lucas. &amp; is not current public!**
* This will include my Blockchain 2.0 concept, how the Bitcoin was secured with my Paper-Chain concept. Why you should not trust a unknown person ""Satoshi""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!For the reason of greed I am bringing my story into the public as the trust created on the day in question I was told anytime I want my ""Coins"" I can ask for them. I tried to login to my account with no luck because the code was changed by Blockchain.com in 2012 making the wallet ""NULL"" or gone!!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

***Follow me on*** [***Twitter.com/BitDigiNet***](https://twitter.com/BitDigiNet) ***where I will be posting ""The Real Story Of Satoshi""***

&amp;#x200B;

\#Share this &amp; stop the evil, limited access to technology creates a ""elite"" market limiting the sucess of people &amp; the quality of life! My vision of a CryptoCurrency world with the Blockchain was invented for Open Market &amp; Freedom!

* My story will show how I put my life on the line for everyone else when I was 17, while watching major companies, banks &amp; organizations either support a lie, cover up truth. Leaving myself with nothing after asking for help!

&amp;#x200B;

***If ""everyone"" being people do not know the truth then the point of creating the Blockchain is worthless! All Bitcoin Project Founders, Creators &amp; Supports before 2008 ""Please Support the TRUTH!""***

Working together, supporting people, &amp; creating goods with services was my goal!

* ***""My vision of Blockchan 2.0 includes: Unlimited Energy, Instant Transfers, &amp; the worlds fastest super computer!""***

&amp;#x200B;

# Working together we can create, progress, &amp; make all lives great!

# Remember Satoshi is a vision Not a Person.

* ***The blockchain is not bitcoin and has potential to secure everything!***

*Donations welcomed. I never was paid for my work!*

Bitcoin,Hey guys so I'm slowly getting better acquainted with Bitcoin.  I've actually made a purchase and sent money from an exchange to electrum wallets but I'm curious if anyone could recommend a video or website that explains some of this stuff  a bit better as I am still somewhat of a newb who doesn't feel very comfortable about anything just yet.  Or if anyone has a prior post they could link in the comments that would be great.  Thanks. 
Bitcoin,"This just crossed my mind. Imagine massive adoption of crypto, including people from generations before the millennials who are not so tech-savvy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Bitcoin becomes primary big store of value - like gold - with altcoins maybe becoming an easier/faster way to pay. Your bitcoin cold wallet is now your most valuable asset, like an offline savings account.

\- Not everyone has a safe, not everyone can afford secure lockup services of cold wallets.

\- Bitcoin cold wallets may be lying somewhere hidden in a lot of households at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't this result in a massive increase of violent home burglaries, knowing that small and large amounts of the world's digital gold can simply lie around for the taking?

In this I see the possibility of banks still having a role in the safekeeping of common people's wealth, with their own secure (hot and cold) wallets and investment possibilities, made simple especially for older generations. On the long run, this may make banks too powerful again, when most of the crypto is still technically in their hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe this gives rise to replacements of banks, like really cheap vault services? Does this exist already? Thoughts please!"
Bitcoin,"There is one big problem I see with Bitcoin. It can never replace our current financial system because: a) you cannot charge interest on loans in BTC; b) it is constantly a deflationary asset which discourages actually spending btc; c) you cannot guarantee your heirs will receive your btc upon your death because doing so would force you to share your private key with someone else prior to you dying; d) you cannot enforce taxes on bitcoin; and e) you cannot make loans in btc because you must have 100% of the btc you are loaning (no fractional-reserve methodology).

&amp;#x200B;

I know this will get downvoted because bitcoin is not designed to do a, b, or d. Bitcoin is designed to uproot our system, not fulfill its needs. And I'm sure the answer to c will be ""just put it in a safe deposit box."" I'm not trusting my entire estate to a safe deposit box. 

&amp;#x200B;

But someone, please, explain how my above assumptions are false. Or, better, explain how we will permanently support a global financial system with no reliable system of creating loans. As I see it, right now, bitcoin is a good speculation tool and a passable store of value."

Bitcoin,"The title is a little too big indeed, but our world seems to be getting worse and worse, we are being told about ecology, pollution, waste, and so many problems, that there will be more and more !

I introduce myself, I'm just a simple Frenchman, for a salary of less than 1500 dollars a month, I live happily with a woman who doesn't eat meat, fortunately also....because yes, meat is expensive, since I stopped eating meat from beef, chicken, pork and others, I've saved money over the past 3 years...but not enough to buy a house especially here in France with the minimum wage.

I have known Bitcoin for 3 years thanks to the sports betting found on blogs... I could only acquire one, following the tweet of CHARLIE LEE. Since then, I have been thinking that there are a lot of things to do with Bitcoin like a certain multi-million dollar donor PINEAPPLE did, which he did was great on his part !

And then I get a stupid but doable idea.

Everyone loves burgers !

And almost everyone wants to save our planet, I mean it....but many think about the future of our children !

More and more people have been eating less meat in recent years for various reasons. Mine were to save money, some of whom have the most financial means for their health !

In America, UNITED STATES, you can find  the IMPOSSIBLE BURGER a brilliant idea guaranteed meat-free and 100% BURGER !

Problem, only available in some restaurants and not available on the market....

I've been following their youtube channel for almost two years now, the link:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R\_1VRJAuTy4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1VRJAuTy4)

and their facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/ImpossibleFoods](https://www.facebook.com/ImpossibleFoods)

Yes I am stupid, but it seems to me that, surely we all want to eat better for our health and live longer, but also leave a slightly greener planet for our children no ?

DOGECOIN achieved a feat a few years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/6eihmq/dogecoin\_nascar\_a\_reminder\_that\_this\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/6eihmq/dogecoin_nascar_a_reminder_that_this_happened/)...be present on a NASCAR car cool ?!

In France we have nothing like that, as in Europe, maybe i'm wrong......

I think the mentality will change when a large multinational group offers something without meat.

The IMPOSSIBLE BURGER is undoubtedly one of the best accessible "" low-cost burgers "", just look on youtube for the number of people who have tested it !

That's why today I'm launching a Bitcoin jackpot, all the funds collected will be used to buy a license from them to offer Europeans, with the help of a partnership with a major fast food chain, the Impossible Burger.

Everyone can benefit ! We as consumers, an alternative to meat, to animal suffering, a good for the ecology and others to review their diet. Because today, our way of consuming will not allow our children to live better than us unfortunately....

&amp;#x200B;

GOAL IS 1000 BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

If this fails, the donations will go to UNICEF.

There can be no diversion, because EVERYTHING is public and traceable with Bitcoin !

ONLY idiots don't know that !

&amp;#x200B;

Yes i am stupid with a stupid dream, but i like humans and I want to do something for my future children, if my project fails, at least I've tried !

&amp;#x200B;

Even just 10 satoshis is a gift  !

The main issue with IEOs at the moment is the fact that bots have a monopoly on them. Within those 7 seconds, the vast majority of the participants were bot accounts thus not allowing real humans to have a chance of entering.

Other than that, the caps tend to be incredibly low with upcoming IEO Matic Network having a cap of only $350 per participant.

The only way to tackle these issues and still profit greatly off IEOs are getting access to private sales where your allocation is secured (meaning that you don't have to fight against bots to get your allocation in) and be given a significantly larger cap than the crowdsale investor.

so no, i dont accept bitcoin.

Bitcoin,Hello fellow Bitcoiners!  I wanted to write down some observations I've had over the past month or so running my Bitcoin Core node.  I should start off by saying that I've been running this node since December through the same ISP and hardware and haven't changed any configuration options since my initial installation. That being said over the last month or so I've seen a substantial increase in how much data my node has been sending. Prior to the past month on average I was sending probably a maybe 10-20 gigs a week whereas I'm now almost at 10 gigs a day!  I've also notice that my inbound connections have jumped up substantially as well. Currently I'm at almost 100 whereas prior to the last few days I would typically have no more than 40.  Has anyone out there noticed this uptick as well? Are there any theories as to why the sudden increase in traffic?  Has anyone noticed this on alternate node builds as well?  Thanks in advance!
Bitcoin,"Following the recent success of BitTorrent and MultiVAC's IEO, it seems that there is a huge interest in IEOs as they seem to be extremely profitable.

MultiVAC's IEO finished a few days ago where they raised $3.6m in less than 7 seconds and is currently trading OTC at 8x ROI of the purchase price already.

The main issue with IEOs at the moment is the fact that bots have a monopoly on them.

Within those 7 seconds, the vast majority of the participants were bot accounts thus not allowing real humans to have a chance of entering. Other than that, the caps tend to be incredibly low with upcoming IEO Matic Network having a cap of only $350 per participant.

The only way to tackle these issues and still profit greatly off IEOs are getting access to private sales where your allocation is secured (meaning that you don't have to fight against bots to get your allocation in) and be given a significantly larger cap than the crowdsale investor.

My friend has created a small community of fellow IEO investors. If anyone wants to join us, feel free to join our telegram group by searching ""**CyCloudNetwork**"" or private message me for more information.

I'm looking forward to meeting new people!"

Bitcoin,"I see prominent Bitcoin speakers suggesting you store your seed phrase on paper.  Very popular and famous ones who this sub goes crazy over, who are indeed great speakers and influential in my knowledge of Bitcoin, but who to me seem completely ignorant in their suggestions to store your seed phrase on paper

They say to store the paper in a safety deposit box at a bank, in a drawer, or in a safe in your house.  Ever been robbed?  When it happens it happens fast.  Ever heard of banks being robbed?  Most likely they won't insure your entire wallet balance if the robber posts a picture of the paper on his darkweb bank robbing discussion forums or wherever the fuck he posts, and asks what it is, only to have the funds stolen

In my view the ONLY place to safely store a wallet seed phrase is in your brain in the form of a decryption key of a securely encrypted VeraCrypt container (if you want to store multiple cryptos) or by memorizing your entire wallet seed phrase thoroughly (for a few months before you ever start using that phrase)

Change my view please because I'm not convinced it's EVER safe to write it down on paper in any situation ever"

Hello everyone, let me start by saying this:

Manual trading, any trading, be it forex, stocks, cryptos.. is 100% destined to fail. Millions of retail traders get punished everyday, and the only winners are wallstreet &amp; bank traders.. why? because they don't trade manually.

Educate yourself on how whales, banks &amp; wallstreet traders actually trade, they are not glued to their screens looking for ridiculous shapes to form on charts.. analytical analysis and manual trading is a BIG HOAX.

They use auto-trading tools like this one

Actually, that's why Auto trading has a bad reputation and for a good reason to be honest.

Wallstreet sharks and bank traders only trade with HFT algorithms, computers that make decisions, not humans. That's why all manual traders lose in the end, they can't keep up with robots' computing powers!

I personally, had a good strategy that made me lose -$30K on MT4 brokers! and with the same strategy tweaked into a robot I am now making +$17K profits a month on autopilot.

Here's the HFT robot maker I use

Wake up and stop being naive! Just quit looking for pin-bars on charts.. wallstreet knows better my friend./

&amp;#x200B;

I like the idea of LN but it seems that it's not ready yet. What worries me is that I am reading a lot of articles in the ""other camp"" about how important it is for LN to have blocks that can handle the traffic. I believe that this is also written down officially by the LN team.

&amp;#x200B;

Since we can see that people are becoming enthusiastic again about Bitcoin, discussing this thing is of utmost importance. I think last time in 2017 we collectively as the community of this open source experiment failed to deliver. It was a combination of war and stubbornness from both sides while it's evidently obvious that a small increase in block sizes would solve a lot of problems including the separation of the community.

&amp;#x200B;

Since when is it taboo to speak about technology? Am I at fault if I urge people to think about making a small block size increase (contrary to  the luney decrease that Luke is proposing) so that we can be confident that LN will work as intended?

&amp;#x200B;

What is the input from the LN team?

&amp;#x200B;

Btw I am a bit worried that all our hopes now are a concentrated bet on well LN will be working in the future. In a sense everybody is betting on its existence as the only way to achieve scalability."

Bitcoin,"We've had this debate for years, and it's cropping up again. I think we need to nip this in the bud now.

If you increase the blocksize then you will decrease fees, thus making it easier for Veriblock and Coinbase to spam the network and never bother to optimise their platforms. When VeriBlock temporarily paused their system, confirmed on-chain transactions dropped from [\~325,000/day to \~225,000/day.](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions) That should give you a sense as to just how much spam is being caused by low fees.

If we go to 2MB, those companies will fill blocks up again. Fees will rise to the exact same level in a short period. Now you've got the same situation as before, except a whole lot of full node operators can't keep up with the bandwidth so turn their nodes off. Blocks will propagate through the network slower, centralising mining and providing an unfair advantage to the previous block winner.

The final point, which really should shut this whole discussion down, is that **we've already been through this. Bcash exists.** It had the same code base as bitcoin at the time of the split. If that's how you think Bitcoin should operate, then just use bcash and be done with it. LN can be built on top of bcash, it's just barely anyone wants to develop for it because overwhelmingly technical people understand why raising the blocksize is a bad idea.

If you're right, bcash will overtake Bitcoin and you can tell everyone I told you so. But you're not going to convince us to change the block size.

And for the love of Christ, if you're a non-technical investor, maybe consider a little humility before insulting the Core devs and demanding a solution you know nothing about to a problem which doesn't exist."

""Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a Sh\_tcoin and here's why"". Now lets get to the topic of this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start with my own story. I was aware of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork coming in 2017 and I had my Bitcoin ready for the fork. After the fork for about a week of patiently waiting and researching how to safely transfer my Bitcoin before claiming my Bitcoin Cash, I did so. Not too long after that, I was amazed at how or even why I instantly had additional value in my crypto portfolio because of this Bitcoin Cash. But I thought to myself. ""I'm not gonna use this thing, I'm still using and saving my Bitcoin. F\_ck it, I'm going to sell it for more Bitcoin"".  And I did just that. I got X% more Bitcoin and I was like ""thanks for that"". Then about December of 2017 when the bull rally was peaking, I can honestly say that I did have a little regret or remorse for selling my Bitcoin Cash. I thought ""Aww man. If I had kept my 1:1 BTC+BCH then my portfolio would be even bigger right now"". But I didn't let it bother me I accepted my decision at the time and I moved on with my life. Fast forward to the past few weeks up to today of me writing this thread, I take back that regret and I am 100% accepting of my decision to sell my Bitcoin Cash and I am actually very happy that I did. Honestly I am 100% happy with my selling of BCH after the hard fork and getting more BTC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let explain why. Most of the reason why comes down to data and a few fundamentals. On 1 August 2017 at Block number 478,558 Bitcoin had its first ever hard fork and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) started its own blockchain with its own rules and a code similar to Bitcoin, but still different and non-compatible. At that block, Bitcoin's supply was approximately 16,484,738 and all of a sudden Bitcoin Cash had a supply of 16,484,738 also. All BCH did was basically ""copy + paste"" the blockchain prior to the hard fork block. Its a copy, a phony, a fake, a rip off, a knock off. There was no actual work or especially any Proof Of Work (POW) for BCH's coin supply of 1 up to 16,484,738. Think about it for a minute. There is NO REAL genesis block for BCH! No, STOP reading for a moment and think about what I just said. The supply of BCH from 1 to 16,484,738 has a true and honest value of Sh\_t. Really it does. Where is the worth for that coin supply range? Where is the VALUE? There is none! Now in all fairness with BCH, the only actual value that I can honestly see is from the coin supply of 16,484,738 to today of approximately 17,717,100 (time of my writing, plus or minus a few blocks) which is only a coin supply of approximately 1,232,362. That is the only real value that I see with BCH and its blockchain and there miners doing work. I think its funny that Traders today think that BCH should be trading at about $300 or 0.0585xxxx BTC? Really? Wow! Given the stats I just gave you then the fair market cap of Bitcoin Cash that has any actual value should only really be worth about $369,708,600. That puts BCH back to about # 26 on coinmarketcap. And My same logic and theory goes for BTG, BSV, LCC and any of these hard forked coins. Just copy + pasted blockchains. OK, so why didn't some of the value of BTC get subtracted to fulfill the value gap between BTC and BCH? Sit on that thought for a moment too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might be thinking or saying ""3Lb4ZRGPAq6Xfo doesn't know what he is talking and he doesn't understand the technology and blockchains and he doesn't understand what Satoshi really wanted for Bitcoin. And he doesn't understand that BCH blocks handle more and there's practically no fees for sending BCH. And, and, and BCH is the 'real bitcoin', not BTC"". Yea, yea, yea, bla bla bla. STFU. Listen... No one needs to be a Techie to understand everything I mentioned above. Satoshi wrote the code for Bitcoin and he/she/they executed it at block 1, a REAL Genesis Block! So you're trying to me... that back in the day when I could mine BTC on my home PC computer that I was also mining BCH at the same time also? And I didn't even know it?! Neither did Satoshi? WOW! AMAZING!!! (as I roll my eyes and shake my head). You can't fool me. I'm not stupid, I'm not an idiot and I'm not a dumb\_ss.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding Bitcoin, sure there's been updates and bugs taken care and a few second layer solutions and SegWit and Lightning and all that authentic and original and ""organically"" performed work done for Bitcoin. I applaud Satoshi and any/all developers for Bitcoin. I believe in POW. I believe in Bitcoin. I believe in Litecoin which also had its own genesis block. I believe in Zcash which again, also had its own genesis block. I also believe in Gold and Silver. I don't believe in BCH, BTG, BSV, LCC, USD, EUR, YEN, USDT or Gov Central Banks. I don't believe in anything that can not prove value like any of those things. Hence why we love ""Proof Of Work"" (POW). At this point, I can only think that BCH only has a specific use case. Which means that I need to trade some BTC or LTC for BCH and then send it. Why? because I need to send crypto super fast or because I'm a cheapskate and I can't afford a small 0.0x% fee for sending a transaction? Well I'm not a cheapskate. Lightning project is also coming along. I admit its a bit technical at the moment, but let it organically mature and grow, its going to be fine. Segwit has been working just fine for me. If I really need crypto sent and confirmed right freaking now within milliseconds, then I can use lightning, or LTC, or DASH's InstantSend.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you get it now? Do you see BCH's real value? No, you still don't? OK. Give me your hand while I walk you across the street. Lets use one more example that most of us should be familiar with. Although the mechanics of this example are different to BCH vs. crypto, its value comparison is right on. Where does most of today's fiat currency come from? Lets use the US dollar for this example. In basic terms, the Government creates a bond and sells that bond to the Federal Reserve (that doesn't have anything on their balance sheet) and poof! USD currency magically springs into existence. Wow! Where is the worth for that magic poof fiat currency? Where is the value? Do you get it now? We all know there are other factors regarding debt attached to that fiat and fractional reserve banking, but that is beyond the topic of this thread and everyone should already know about that by now and if not, please educate a friend or family member.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion to this thread, I feel that Bitcoin Cash will go down in the crypto history books along with Mt.Gox and Bitconnect and QuadrigaCX. Or maybe I'm completely wrong... But I doubt it. Only you and the free market will decide in the end. I believe in and I am invested in the other above mentioned crypto and I will trade some other altcoins, but I have no desire to even trade BCH. I did not write this thread as a stunt or market mover or for donations. I just want to share it with you and with the world. Although if one has a good point to be made or good idea, then I believe that one can also be rewarded or accept donations if you found this topic worth while or... if it... ""HAS VALUE""! This whole concept has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I needed to share it with the world. If you agree with me or disagree is irrelevant. You can reply all you want to this thread or be angry with me or tell me off all you want. It can't and won't bother me, so I am saving you typing energy ha ha.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello there, OnTheStreetsIRan. Are you still considering bitcoin trading, instead of hodling and hoping for the best? my advice is to stay away from manual trading and go automated route. No headaches, everything is automated, and excruciatingly profitable. Manual trading, any trading, be it forex, stocks, cryptos.. is **100% destined to fail**. Millions of retail traders get punished everyday, and the only winners are wallstreet &amp; bank traders.. why? because they don't trade manually.

Educate yourself on how whales, banks &amp; wallstreet traders actually trade, they are not glued to their screens looking for ridiculous shapes to form on charts.. **analytical analysis and manual trading is a BIG HOAX**.

They use auto-trading tools like [**this one**](https://autoprofits.netlify.com/)

Actually, that's why Auto trading has a bad reputation and for a good reason to be honest.

Wallstreet sharks and bank traders only trade with HFT algorithms, computers that make decisions, not humans. That's why all manual traders lose in the end, they can't keep up with robots' computing powers!

I personally, had a good strategy that made me lose **-$30K** on MT4 brokers! and with the same strategy tweaked into a robot I am now making **+$17K** profits a month on autopilot.

Here's the [**HFT robot maker**](https://autoprofits.netlify.com/) I use

Wake up and stop being naive! Just quit looking for pin-bars on charts.. **wallstreet knows better my friend./**

There is a LOT of room between not expanding the block size at all and indefinitely expanding it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are the specific variables and constraints affecting cost and availability of storage, memory, processing power, network bandwidth and latency. Where is the model with actual numbers? Technology has evolved and has gotten cheaper in the past 10 years, and will continue to do so in the future. We need concrete numbers in a mathematical model, not just ideological poop fights. What we don't need is more posts about this subject that come here defending a conclusion without a single reference to a scientific model that can explain exactly how and why the conclusion of 2MB limit has been reached.

Excessively coveting wealth has a name in medical psychology: money disorder, the obsessive desire to accrue money and wealth. This pathology, like most disorders, is hard and complicated to approach, especially nowadays given how frequently people worship money and all it represents.

Many of us have watched Martin Scorsese‚Äôs The Wolf of Wall Street, where Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of a bold New York [br√≥ker](http://brokersconfiables.com/tag/2mercados) obsessed with money and the hue of all it offers. Nothing was enough for him despite swimming in wealth and having all he ever wished for, to the point of rampant corruption and unpunished crimes as his values were consumed by his boundless and uncontrollable greed. For him nothing was enough. Everything was too little, and he always needed more.

This is why when we work in the world of [trading,](http://brokersconfiables.com/) it‚Äôs crucial to have control over our own emotions and cast our impulses aside.

Bitcoin,"I was aware of bitcoin in early 2017, thought about investing in farms, then decided not to and just paid off my student loan debt over the next year. In 2018 everyone was talking about bitcoin, but with the price so high I didn't trust it yet. Felt it was booming because of people jumping in and that it would soon crash, which it did. About a month ago I started looking at bitcoin as an investment again, and everything seemed solid. I looked into wallets, how to purchase bitcoin, articles, everything, and I liked what I saw. For whatever reason that escapes me I forgot about it/neglected to follow up. This morning I randomly decided to check the price and it broke the threshold all of the articles I had seen were talking about. I decide I should buy now instead of waiting as just one month cost me about $1,000. Better to buy and forget then wait and wish I'd bought sooner. 

Just purchased a ledger S, says 2 day shipping. I will be leaving Wednesday night for out of town, so I may miss the package. My question was should I buy bitcoin now through something like coinbase then transfer it to my wallet when I get it, or should I wait until I get my wallet to purchase any bitcoin for security? Asking because I'd hate to miss the package wednesday, then come back next monday and the price tests the waters at $6,000 and I'm out another $7-800. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Also should I be buying through coinbase? Seems like the % fee is a bit steep but it seems like the way to go."

Bitcoin,"I understand people bad mouth MyCelium as untrustworthy because of an incident whereby the team spent investment money to vacation in Europe, or something like that. But when I saw them later came out with a segwit upgrade, I decided they were trying to move forward with a new good faith effort. So, I chose to keep using MyCelium on Android. 

I recently conducted the following transaction:
7dfed65b111977c8408b9f1b65ca1275e700c8315771a49e3ac8984bc564e1ac

It shows not one but two outputs and the 2nd is not a change address back to my wallet. MyCelium sent most of my money to the intended recipient but sent some more somewhere else. 

What's more suspicious is that all my other wallet providers are recognizing both outputs as having happened and they all agree what my new (lower) balance is. But MyCelium is not acknowledging the 2nd output and it's reporting a higher balance as if the 2nd output (it conducted!) didn't happen. 

If somehow I'm confused and I was not just robbed, someone please explain it to me. But looking at my transaction history on the blockchain through multiple resources, they all seem to be telling me I leaked hundreds of dollars of bitcoin.

I've written to info@mycelium.com, asking for their help to resolve this. If they do reply, I'll update this post with that outcome. Until then, I recommend nobody trust MyCelium with another transaction."

Bitcoin,When analyzing certain blockchains you can find many transactions in which users give a high transaction fee that exceeds the actual transfer amount. This case happens in cryptocurrency networks with proof of work and in many cases is an initial signal that an entity is attempted to hide the source of funds or launder funds through miners/mining pools.

A little side project myself &amp; the crew have been working on, designed to cut through all the bulls#\*% you may have read or heard about Bitcoin‚Ä¶(there‚Äôs lots of it). It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, nor is it about ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù. It‚Äôs about what matters: Bitcoin.

As a concept, as a monetary phenomenon &amp; as a new form of global, digital collaboration that is fair and robust in nature.  


I believe we've done a good job distilling a broadly complex concept into something digestible, so that more people know what the real innovation in this space is. 

&amp;#x200B;

We‚Äôll be publishing 2 of these per year. It‚Äôs 100% free. 

No ulterior motive except helping spread the right narrative via great content.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you enjoy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS - if you did enjoy the read &amp; agree that more people should hear about it; we‚Äôd love it if you upvoted us on Product Hunt and on Reddit + share it around with more people.

Bitcoin,"Here is the message for curious:  


Hello there, mzzntn. Are you still considering bitcoin trading,xxxxxxxxxxxxxx instead of hodling and hoping for the best? my advice is to stay away from manual trading and go automated route. No headaches, everything is automated, and excruciatingly profitable. Manual trading, any trading, be it forex, stocks, cryptos.. is **100% destined to fail**. Millions of retail traders get punished everyday, and the only winners are wallstreet &amp; bank traders.. why? because they don't trade manually.

Educate yourself on how whales, banks &amp; wallstreet traders actually trade, they are not glued to their screens looking for ridiculous shapes to form on charts.. **analytical analysis and manual trading is a BIG HOAX**.

They use auto-trading tools like [**this one**](https://autoprofits.netlify.com/)

Actually, that's why Auto trading has a bad reputation and for a good reason to be honest.

Wallstreet sharks and bank traders only trade with HFT algorithms, computers that make decisions, not humans. That's why all manual traders lose in the end, they can't keep up with robots' computing powers!

I personally, had a good strategy that made me lose **-$30K** on MT4 brokers! and with the same strategy tweaked into a robot I am now making **+$17K** profits a month on autopilot.

Here's the  [**HFT robot maker**](https://autoprofits.netlify.com/) I use

Wake up and stop being naive! Just quit looking for pin-bars on charts.. **wallstreet knows better./**

First time solo travelling here, got 15 full days to enjoy my first time visit to Vietnam! I leave in under 10 days, so I would like to know what your thoughts are about my rough draft itinerary.

Hanoi: 3 days...

Hue: 2 days... 
Hoi An: 3 days...
Ho Chi Minh: 3 days...

Thanks - I look forward to hearing from you."
travel,"Hey travelers!  My two best friends and I will be in Antwerp this August for a wedding, before heading to London a week later for a second ceremony, and we're trying to figure out where best to pass the days between events.

We'd like to be somewhere where there is plenty to do, but where we can also enjoy a little nature, and I'd love to get your feedback on the following ideas:

* Amsterdam: beautiful, fun city (I've been once), only an hour's train ride from  Hoge Veluwe National Park (which I haven't seen)
* Bournemouth/ Portsmouth: coastal towns in southern England, which look reasonably picturesque, though there may not be too much to do there?
* Munich: again, I've visited once and really enjoyed it, though not sure there's much nature nearby?
* Strasbourg: looks like a beautiful old town, and is close enough to the Black Forest for some day hikes
* Zurich: sits on a lake, and has mountains nearby for day hikes

Lastly, we could opt to stay in Antwerp, and do some day trips around Belgium.  Ghent and Bruges come highly recommended, plus we could spend a day in Brussels.

Would greatly appreciate any thoughts/ feedback from anyone who's visited these places before, or who might have some other suggestions.  Thanks in advance!"

Anyway I have a flight that lands in Osaka ITM Airport, and I'm staying in an Airbnb in Kyoto that appears to be a few miles south of Kyoto's central train station. I am planning on getting a 7 day JR Pass while I'm there.

Does the JR Pass cover local trains around Kyoto? If not, how do I go about getting a train ticket / train pass? There's a station that's about a block from my Airbnb so I want to just take various trains from ITM Airport to my Airbnb.

Any general tips about taking the train around Japan?? I love to travel but I've never been more nervous and apprehensive about a trip as this one :/"

As we're also planning on visiting Crete during our trip we're wondering whether or not it would make sense to travel to Crete first instead if transportation there makes more sense. Any suggestions?"

Last day since my flight is at 12pm, drive from wherever I‚Äôm staying to the airport and fly back home.

We will be looking to visit most places that have history, great views, excursions, exploring, delving into the local atmosphere and living and of course the food and drink.

It seems like bus and train tickets, even for relatively short distances, are insanely expensive. I've heard that getting a foreigner bus pass or train pass is a good way to save money overall, however:


1) Those are often only good for a few consecutive days, and

2) I'm having a really hard time finding a pass that matches my route.

My route is as follows:

* Currently in Kumamoto for one more day.

* After tomorrow, I travel to Miyazaki for 2 nights, then

* 1 night in Beppu.

* 3 nights in Hiroshima

* 1 night in Fukuyama (to see the rabbit island)

* 4 nights in Osaka

* 4 nights in Kyoto

* 4 nights in Tokyo


I've spent hours looking at bus options, but it's hard to find sites that give good, up to date info in English, and I think I'm getting in over my head. I can't really see any solution that doesn't involve spending hundreds of dollars in bus passes, but I'm not sure what else to do. Anyone have any good suggestions for the cheapest ways to get between each stop on my list?"

I have an upcoming ""Around the World"" trip coming up where I'll be traveling to Seoul, Phuket, Istanbul, Vienna, Stockholm, and Dublin. My question is - anyone have any advice for exchanging currency? Would it be best to go to a domestic bank before my trip and ""order"" said currencies, or should I just exchange whatever I have left over from one place to the next? The currency exchanges within the airports would obviously be the most convenient, but also not the best rates. I will not be in each place for very long (less than a week each), so I imagine that credit cards payment would be available for most places as well (obviously not for tipping or street market type activities).

travel,"Howdy guys,

I plan on flying out to Larnaca from the States. To save some money, I plan on flying out to Manchester then fly to Larnaca. It was cheaper for me to fly from Manchester to Larnaca, but I was concerned about UK's Air Passenger Tax. I would be on my connecting flight within 24 hours of my arrival to Manchester. When I was looking at flights, (Thomas Cook) flights from Manchester to Larncaca applied the duty in their breakdown of fees and charges. The flight (Delta) from the States to Manchester doesn't breakdown their fees and charge, so I'm unsure if the duty is applied already.


To my understanding, the duty does not apply if ""stops-over"" for less than 24 hours. My self-connecting flights fit underneath it, but I'm not sure if self-connecting flights applies. I also want to not be charge with the duty. I tried speaking with a Delta representative, but they had no idea what I was talking about. I going to try and talk with a different Delta representative and a Thomas Cook representative later. 

So do I have to pay for Air Passenger Tax? Thanks!"

So far I've counted on my friends who are much more experienced in travelling to help me sort out what I need to do but... since I'm going solo on this one, I can't really rely on anyone. Which is why I'm here ...

Could you guys help me figure out what I need? There's honestly a bit of information overload going on right now and I can't quite parse it all. 

I know I need a valid **Passport**, which I obviously got. I made it just for this trip actually.

I also know I will be required to have an **eTA**, which I don't really know how to get or what it is...

I've heard of other stuff such as ""visiting visas"" and such which I have no idea if I need to get one or how to get it...

Any help clearing up my doubts will be greatly appreciated!!"

travel,"Hey

First post on this sub reddit - i have just got back from a wonderful break in Athens with a long distance partner, and came across / was victim to a street scam. Although only for the loss of a couple of euros, its still embarassing and infuriating. I wondered if anybody here has been victim to a similar scam in Athens / other European cities? 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the scam goes.

A gypsy / roma kid sits down on a bench and starts playing an instrument.

They put a tiny clear plastic cup filled with pennies in the middle of the pavement, meters from them. So people have no idea its there 

Unsuspecting people accidently kick it as they cant see it

The kid screams and shouts at them

Poeople get down on their hands and knee's to look for the coins, and eventually feel bad and give thema  few euros.

Repeat in a different location. 

&amp;#x200B;

This happened to me on my first day there, and I immediately felt awful for it. And gave them 5 euros.

However I then noticed this happen another SEVEN times to other people, in the 3 days that I was there. All on the SAME STREET , in the Monastiraki shopping district. By the end I was telling people the poor tourists it was a scam and I've seen it happen many times in  just a few days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have similar experiances happened to you guys?"

We have family south of the city that we'll be visiting occasionally, but also doing touristy stuff like the Japanese Gardens, walking along the river, eating way too many Voodoo Donuts, spending too much time in Powell's, and so on.  It would be great if there were things for kids to do nearby that maybe we haven't heard of or tried yet.

Anyway, this will be the first time we'll be staying in the city proper, and there are a TON of hotel choices. Too many, so I'm looking for some personal experience.

We have gold status with Hilton Honors, and silver elite with Marriott Bonvoy, but that isn't going to be a huge factor in our decision.  A plus would be free breakfast and free wi-fi.

Thank you all for your suggestions."

Good morning guys. I wanted to write my frustration with American Airlines. I live down in Miami, but I always drive up to Fort Lauderdale to fly with Southwest. this time,  I, along with my family, flew out of Miami to Chicago. Although I had to pay for bag fees, and dumb seat fees in order for us to sit together, the flight from Miami to Chicago was great.

¬†On our way back to Miami, we had a connecting flight at Charlotte. First, I paid again the crazy seat fees and bag fee, our flight from Chicago got delayed and lost the connecting flight. Then, they switches us to a flight that was going to Fort Lauderdale. That flight was getting delayed every 30 minutes since 9 p.m. They cancelled it at midnight with the same bad weather excuse, and told us to go to customer service to change it. They delayed and cancelled a bunch of flights that night with the same bad weather excuse. What i found weird was that on the airport screen, I had noticed that Delta, United, and Southwest flights were on time. Only American flights were getting delayed and gate changed every now and then. In conclusion guys, I had to call work to tell them that I couldn't make it to work the next day, buy food, and sleep at the airport with my family. There were pregnant women, little kids, very old people, and American Airlines didn't even give food or place to sleep. I just wanted to share my experience, as I might not fly with them again."

travel,"Hey folks. 

My partner and I have been travelling in Bolivia for the past week, landing in La Paz on 3rd April and squeezing in both an Amazon jungle tour and a Salar dr Uyuni tour in since then. (Amazing, but I'll leave that to another post). 

Unfortunately on the night we arrived, my card was swallowed by a Banco Union ATM in the street. The next morning, my partner's card was swallowed by a Banco Bisa ATM!!!

That left us one card left for our travels that we nervously used over the tours mentioned above. We got some help from friendly hotel staff and tour booking staff who called the banks in question for us and let us know we'd have a window to reclaim the cards within when we returned from the tours. That window was today. 

Unfortunately Banco Bisa had already destroyed my girlfriend's card (apparently), even though their communications had implied we'd have that window. 

My card was there at Banco Union and able to be reclaimed! However, herein lies my question/concern. To retrieve the card, they took a photocopy of my passport, and a photocopy of BOTH sides of my Visa debit card - then asked me to sign both. 

What happens to these copies? I'm well aware I've literally handed over enough information for identity fraud here, but I didn't really have much choice. Should I be worried? Or is our Banco Union customer service staff member going to do the right thing and file these documents in the right place? Anyone else had this before?

TL;DR - bankcard swallowed by ATM in La Paz, lots of crucial identity information photocopied by bank staff in order to retrieve. Should I be worried?"

South America would include Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile.

Where can I slip in some nice sunrises/sunsets?  Can I plan hikes to avoid peak traffic hours? Are my days too full/full enough?

Thank you in advance for any/all feedback!  This is the first time I've taken responsibility for the planning and I'd like to try and get it right."

I'm going to Greece for two weeks in mid-May and have about a week (at most two) to spare after that. I'm looking for recommendations for places to see that I could fit in that time, ideally a place that has things to see and not just a relaxation spot. I've already seen Turkey, and I feel like Italy justifies its own trip.

Any advice is appreciated!"

travel,"Hi everyone,

My wife, Dad, Sister, her Partner and I are planning a short winter European trip from November. Currently our itinerary looks like the following:

**23rd November - 24 November:** Wife and I depart SYD Australia for Stockholm Sweden (I have family here we will be staying with for free).

**24 November -  30th November:** Do things in Sweden, not sure what yet. Probably a lot of skiing, exploring the town, spending time with Family and trying to hopefully see the Northern Lights.

**30th November - 1st December:** Travel to Berlin, Germany. Meet with rest of family (travelling up later than us)

**1st December - 4th December:** Berlin, Germany. Mostly want to explore the city, do the Berlin wall and any other major important places to go for a first time group. Christmas Markets are a must.

**4th December:** Berlin, Germany --&gt; Prague, Czech Republic (train)

**5th - 8th December:** Prague things. See old town, etc. Unsure really.

**8th December:** Prague --&gt; Krakow, Poland

**9th - 12th December:** Auschwitz tour is a must for us. Other than that, Krakow is a beautiful city and exploring it will be the rest of our time here.

**12th December:** Krakow, Poland --&gt; (either) Vienna, Austria / Budapest, Turkey: Can't decide between the two here. Really Budapest seems closer by map to Krakow but I here so many conflicting opinions about these two destinations that it's hard to decide.

**12th - 15th December:** Spend time in final location

**15th December:** Fly home.

I'd love some help from more experienced travelers on the following:

**1)** Is this too packed? Is 4 destinations feasible in two weeks? If it is feasible, does anybody have any winter recommendations between Vienna or Budapest?

**2)** I am struggling to find any nature walks / hikes that lead to really beautiful views in winter. I really enjoy nature photography (though I am an absolute novice) and I would love opportunities to experience some breathtaking nature.

**3)** As a selfish aside, I really really wanted to see the neuschwanstein castle while we were in Europe but it doesn't seem like there would be any logical way to do this with the path outlined above. Is this correct?

Thanks so much in advance."

The schedule is roughly as follows: Berchtesgaden -&gt; Salzburg -&gt; Sbahn to Halstatt -&gt; Linz -&gt; Liezen -&gt; Passau

For context, I bike often but never done anything like this before.

\+Is there any notable spot along this path/ the Alpen area that I should stop by? I like scenic views so no touristy spots for me

\+Can you take bikes on the S-Bahn?

\+Any notable cheap lodging options?

\+How should I take care of food? I don't know if eateries open on Ostern and German supermarkets (where I'm based) seems to not have good dried foods for instant eating along the way

\+Any recommended apps for navigating here?

\+Any regional ticket I should consider? I'm using the Bayern Ticket for my departure and arrival

travel,"This advice doesn‚Äôt really apply to people just doing a day trip to C√≥rdoba as it requires you he here very early in the morning, and sacrifice your valuable sleeping time. 

If you want to visit the mosque turned cathedral in C√≥rdoba it is free for one hour everyday between 8:30-9:30 AM. Otherwise it‚Äôs 22‚Ç¨ if google isn‚Äôt lying to me, regardless of price, it‚Äôs not cheap so it‚Äôs best to go when free if possible and waking up for 8:30 isn‚Äôt that bad. It‚Äôs a beautiful place of worship and I was just there and if you go in low seasons it‚Äôs not even that busy for a place that‚Äôs free for an hour. An hour is also enough time to get around the entire inside (the outside is free all the time so take as much time outside as you want). 

Also I booked three nights in C√≥rdoba and most people do it as a day trip, in my opinion everything in C√≥rdoba can be seen comfortably in 2 full days, so I believe my 3 nights was too much, on the other hand one day is not enough in my opinion to really experience C√≥rdoba, so I would recommend two full days for C√≥rdoba to see everything comfortably.

I booked a coach flight through Orbitz and it is 6 hour domestic flight. I'm not a frequent flyer at all, and the last time we flew was 2017 and we could see our seats when we booked, and we were automatically seated together since we bought or tickets in the same transaction. JetBlue seems to not reveal the seating until you get to the airport (?) unless you buy the ""more space"" seats for $95 each (no thanks). What is your experience in ensuring you sit with your spouse/partner/friend on a JetBlue coach flight without having to pay fees? Did they end up automatically sitting you together since your ticket numbers were consecutive?

In a couple weeks I'll be heading off to several countries. I'm trying to make sure my budget is realistic before I leave and would love if anyone could confirm or deny where I'm at or share their experience. These numbers are ONLY for food each day; other things are already locked down or have very set prices. I'm not really a picky eater and think a main attraction of all these places will be street food, but occasionally being in mid tier restaurants will be nice.   


Daily Food Cost Estimated...

Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai) = $10 or 310 baht

India (New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra) = $10 or 710 rupees

Nepal (Kathmandu) = $15 or 1,700 rupee

Myanmar (Mandalay, Bagan, Yangon) = $10 or 15,123 kyatt

Laos (Luang Prabang) = $10 or 85,220 kip

Vietnam (Hanoi, Cat Ba) = $15 or 340,000 dong

Cambodia (Siem Reap) = $15 or 60,000 riel

travel,"Hi r/travel! I will be going to Italy (Milan, Florence, Venice) in early May with my husband and my mom. We will be renting a car. All 3 of us enjoy traveling so we know some basic tips and things to look for. I know some Italian, not fluent but enough to get by I think. I've been to Italy twice before but a long time ago before I got sick.

Unfortunately I seem to be in an awful flare up of fibromyalgia and ulcerative colitis symptoms. Pain is a big symptom of course, or more specifically muscle spasms. On my honeymoon I ended up in the ER unable to move my neck because of it. I do not have a script for muscle relaxers, as I am an idiot and haven't seen a doctor for it in a while (felt better), and now can't be seen until after. I saw my primary and explained, she said basically that ""us women get nervous before traveling"" and to ask my psychiatrist for xanax (no go for me, recovering addict). 

The other, probably more nerve wracking symptom is urgency to use the bathroom. I get awful cramps, for which I have medication but it doesn't always work. But when this feeling hits me, it's intense and I have to find a bathroom NOW. I am very lucky in that I have never ""not made it"" to the bathroom but it is a very real concern. That and the longer I do manage to wait, the worse the pain gets. 

Both of these also result in a lot of fatigue. I have traveled with these conditions before, but never anywhere where it was much of an issue. Resorts, Canada, that kind of thing. 

What I am doing to prepare: making a list of meds, dosages, doctors, medical info to have in case I need to see someone there. Bringing every otc med and remedy I use regularly, including electrolytes. Will be sure to carry coins and tissues for bathrooms. Packing as light as possible. My next infusion for the ulcerative colitis med I take is a week or so before which helps. We have extra leg room on the plane and I will bring my own travel pillow. I feel like there's more but that's all I can think of now. Also I have a medical bracelet but don't usually wear it because I just haven't seen a need for it I suppose.

Anyway, sorry for the novel, I'm just scared. I don't want my adventurous husband and mom to feel burdened. They are fun travelers, and I don't want to be a stick in the mud. And of course, I want to be as comfortable as possible. 

Thanks so much!"

This is our first real vacation in 6 years, and our 2 toddlers will be staying with their grandparents.

We are planning to split it up pretty even, 4-5 in Paris, 5-6 is the Lauterbrennen region, looking at Murren or Wengen.  We are looking at Airbnb's and we need to make a decision on the number of days.

A couple questions...

- does the split seem good to you all?
- travelling to Switzerland and doing hiking within Switzerland, would it make sense to get a Swissrail pass of some sort?
- we fly out of Geneva at 3pm, it looks like we can catch early trains our of Murren or Wengen and get there with a few hours to spare but has anyone done this?  Trying to determine if we should head closer to Geneva a day early rather than the morning of.


Lastly, we booked Iceland Air, like 900 roundtrip out of Dulles for each of us.  Reasonable I think....but then I read there carry on baggage policy which has measurements slightly small than what we have and what other airlines require.  Any insight here based on your experiences?

travel,"I will be traveling from Hamburg to Copenhagen this summer and from [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Hamburg.htm#Hamburg-Copenhagen), I can take a train that boards a ferry in the middle of the trip. This sounds like an amazing experience and after seeing some of the pictures, I am interested in traveling this way. It says that I can get a ticket for this trip through the German Railways [website](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml) and once I enter the date and time I want (June 30th at 9:00) along with my destination, I can see that there is a train that leaves Hamburg at 9:28, but I'm not sure if this trip is the one with the ferry. What confuses me is that it says there is a change at Roedby to a bus that will take me to my final destination. The time matches what it says on seat61, but like I said, the change to a bus is what's confusing me. I'm not sure if the trip with the ferry is no longer available, if I'm missing something, or if this is the correct trip. I was hoping someone here can help me out or provide me with some clarification. This is my first time traveling to Copenhagen and I just want to be able to experience as much as I can.

I will be traveling to South Africa at the end of the year and need help! I have 1.5 blank pages left in my passport... I am aware that South Africa requires 2 consecutive blank pages, but as I am traveling from the US I will not need a visa or anything. I am wondering, have any of you had a similar experience when visiting SA? I will be flying on Qatar Airways so in particular if you have had experience with this airline I would love to know!

travel,"39 year-old Canadian man, have back packed around South America, Nepal, and lived in Japan and England.  Will be traveling for about 4 weeks starting in late May.  Will be visiting Tokyo and Hong Kong to visit family and would like to hit a beachy destination for a little R and R for about 2 weeks.

Last time, about 5 years ago, the kind folks of Reddit recommended Palawan, PH, which I had never heard about and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I'd like to visit a similar kind of destination, just somewhere I haven't been:   A beach type place, but one with a relaxing atmosphere where I can go snorkelling, go island hopping, hang out at a bar/restaurant and meet some friendly locals and some tourists.  I do want to do some reflecting during this time, which is why I don't want to party 24/7 or do drugs and kind of want to avoid a big tourist trap.  Is there any place like this in Thailand, Vietnam, or any other nearby countries?  

I visited Bangkok, Thailand 15 years ago but it was with a Japanese tour so I stayed at a hotel and didn't get to meet anyone.  Didn't visit any good beaches or islands.  I feel like I didn't really get to experience the country other than the popular sight seeing destinations, which I'm not really into.  What I enjoy most is chilling out near the beach, making a connection with another traveler or local and having a laugh over beer.  And then maybe go island hopping with them.  Is there a part of Thailand that isn't like film ""The Beach"" but more low-key and closer to what I'm looking for?  

One of the things I really liked about Palawan was that I could stay at a place for 2-3 days before moving on to another part of the island so I didn't feel stuck at one place.  I really enjoy the freedom of moving around and traveling even for such a short duration of 2 weeks. 

Could you please recommend a place or an itinerary that you think I might enjoy?  

Thank you very much."

We are a relatively active family that is interested in historical sights and plenty of natural beauty. My son is a teenager in high school that takes German. As a result, he's politicked for a trip heavy in German sights. Being German in ethnicity, I didn't push back much. As such, I'm looking for recommendations on tentative stops. My original plan was flying into Luxembourg City (per recommendation from my best friend) due to it's proximity to Germany but moreover, due to the size and ease of which that airport is to use. From there I had all too many stops planned (Freiburg, Triburg, Munich, Prague, Dresden, Berlin, Amsterdam, Trier, Luxembourg) but most importantly, had Prague as a spot for Christmas and Amsterdam as our New Years stop.   


I'm looking for some advice on tentative stops.

Hi everyone!

I started a video series on determinism, free will, causation, consciousness and I guess on the nature of reality in general. I mainly critique the views of Sam Harris and physicist Sean Carroll. In the series I present an alternative view on the before mentioned themes based on the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, the founder of pragmatism.

One of my main points is to show how determinism is **not** the only possible interpretation of scientific knowledge and observations. In other words deterministic world view is not a synonym for a scientific world view. Actually there are a lot of phenomena where determinism is not satisfactory (for example growth of complexity, growth in variation).

So if you are interested, please check out the series. And if you are interested in pragmatism in general, I have more videos on my channel."

philosophy,[removed]
philosophy,"First of all this is nowhere near my area of expertise but recently I‚Äôve been fascinated by it. 

So in my view moral truths may or may not exist. I‚Äôm not religious and therefore I don‚Äôt have any idea where a basis for morality stems from. There are no hard and fast rules for saying something is always right or wrong. In this scenario I‚Äôd consider myself a moral nihilist. However something in my gut tells me that morals must exist because it‚Äôs obvious when someone commits an atrocity like a terrorist attack or the like. Surely this act is wrong from a rational standpoint. It causes physical harm and emotional harm. 

So then if I can admit that there are absolute moral truths in some circumstances then that takes me to a point of objective morality mainly because subjective morality does not make sense to me. If morality was subjective then what is the point of holding moral beliefs at all? If every cultures moral norms are ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù then they contradict each other. I could hold any moral view that I wanted to and it would be permissible. Surely then if moral truths exist then they must be objective? I‚Äôm curious for any reading recommendations you all have for me as well as your opinions."

philosophy,The Problem of Boredom: A Philosophical Perspective
philosophy,"Q: If aggression is what is preferred in most situations, where then is the place Anger?

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of backstory: Throughout my life I¬¥ve suppressed anger and aggression equally. In short: it's given me problems. I now see aggression as a good thing as it is a goal driven motivator while anger I have set categorized as bad since I think of the experience of anger as one where one loses sight of the goal and oneself where anger takes hold and the desire to destroy whatever comes to mind. I now think of aggressions as distinct opposites eventhough they are fueled by the same force. You cannot be aggressive without a clear goal, and cannot be angry with one. What¬¥s your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Question number 2: Is anger a mad feeling in that one looses oneself while under its influence?

&amp;#x200B;

We have some value from anger right? After all we have developed in through evolution. On the other, Senecus seems to have had the thought it is nothing, but insanity. If I'm wrong please say so.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading."

 anyway, we're living a civil war between Hafter's army and people who don't want Hafter to enter Tripoli like what happened to Yemen, the problem is that the main affected from this war are civilians who have nothing to do with this war and just forced to live their home and or maybe get killed for nothing just war about rule the country, the other problem is that people are divided into two groups one with Hafter's army and the other one against Hafter's and just watching the war moving and  forgetting what will leaves behind it not to forget to mention its consequences, so I'm just afraid that will stay for a long time and seeing a lot of people die.  


so what you can recommend me to convince people to stop this war and unify ourselves, just any story or book that I can learn to make a lot of people convinced that is wars is not always the right solution to solve our issues"

I‚Äôve taken about 4 classes through college but have spent a lot of time learning independently; I‚Äôd say I know more about philosophy than economics. 

I had a great professor I could talk to about my independent studies with for a while, but communications have withered over the past couple years. So what I‚Äôm looking for here is someone who really knows his/her shit lol that would also be kind enough to help me move closer to the truth.

philosophy,"First things first, human values are worthless, it is something created by man trying to play god and instill value upon things they're comfortable with. 

The only real values are the laws of physics and reality itself, as it is absolute and not a man-made concept. Now, this subject will be talked about in the later parts but I'm going to put it aside for now.

I will now discuss about the main topic, the concept that is existence and life. 'Living' is merely another state of matter. The difference between 'living' and 'nonliving' is that a living thing is dynamic, and nonliving things are static. Living things tend to have more advanced/complex structure than nonliving tings and change constantly because of numerous mechanical/chemical reactions. 

Though I'm not saying that living things are inferior or equal to nonliving things, in fact, it's superior in numerous ways. It's just that they tend to be more smaller and insignificant to nonliving things like celestial objects. The plus side however is that they have a more obvious 'will' and drive to survive to the furthest they can. Matter tends to want to be more 'whole' or bigger. It is why stars are born, matter has this force that forces them to become more powerful and bigger. An example of this is compatible molecules sticking to each other and making the 'object' more bigger (Like a water droplet falling and being forced to combine with an ocean) 

Life is the same. Unicellular organisms evolved to multi-cellular organisms because they wanted to be more powerful and bigger, similar to how matter works, because they're fundamentally the same thing. We have also been doing this as a society, becoming more advanced and thus more powerful and bigger. However, we are becoming too distracted by unnecessary things and therefore having corrupt and selfish people in power, which is toxic to society and leads to degradation as a whole. To continue the absolute meaning of existing, to reach the perfect state of existence, we must disregard our human values such as greed, bias, irrationality, and corruption, as all of these unnecessary things are man-made concepts that just declines humanity's advancement. 

To exist, and to live, is to try and reach the nonexistent limit that is perfection.

Eventually, every social platform is starting to look and feel similar.

Last November, social media code hacker [Jane Manchun Wong](https://twitter.com/wongmjane) spotted LinkedIn's first tests of its own variation of Reactions, the Facebook emoji response tool which provides a quick and easy way to express more than just a Like on a post.

üì∑

Now LinkedIn has [officially announced](https://blog.linkedin.com/2019/april-/11/introducing-linkedin-reactions-more-ways-to-express-yourself) the arrival of the tool, which looks slightly different to the test version, but is exactly like Facebook's response option.

üì∑

As explained by [LinkedIn](https://blog.linkedin.com/2019/april-/11/introducing-linkedin-reactions-more-ways-to-express-yourself):

*""One of the things we regularly hear from all of you is that you want more expressive ways than a ‚ÄúLike‚Äù to respond to the* *variety* *posts you see in your feed. At the same time, you‚Äôve also told us that when you post on LinkedIn, you want more ways to feel heard and understand why someone liked what you said. That‚Äôs why today we‚Äôre starting to roll out a set of Reactions on LinkedIn, giving you more ways to quickly and constructively communicate with one another.""*

I mean, they haven't even given it another name - it seems like as soon as Facebook stole the Stories idea from Snapchat, it opened the floodgates for functional replication. Now, whenever a platform sees a tool that's gaining some level of popularity on another site, and could also suit their needs, they just copy it straight out. You could argue that this began when everyone copied the News Feed from Facebook, but it seems more overt these days, more up front.

That's not necessarily a criticism, it's more an observation. Once Facebook stopped even trying to present some alternate narrative as to how it came up with Stories, it seemed to flag to everyone else that it was okay to blatantly duplicate cool features you like from other platforms. And now, here we are.

The actual, live version of LinkedIn's Reactions varies slightly from the test iteration initially spotted in November, with the heart emoji replacing the image of two people side by side. LinkedIn has also provided [a full overview](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designing-linkedin-reactions-ricardo-rivera/)of its process for choosing its Reactions, which essentially came down to providing responses that corresponded with the most common 1-2 word comments being used on the platform, and what types of posts members were sharing most.

üì∑

You'll note that 'Love' was not one of these main options (thought the emoji is listed under 'Gratitude or Appreciation'). According to LinkedIn:

*""We analyzed our feedback channels including comments on LinkedIn and social media. We regularly heard members saying ‚ÄúI need a Love reaction.‚Äù*

Eventually, through various trials, they settled on the five you see now.

üì∑

So, now you can quickly respond to LinkedIn posts, the same as you can on Facebook. Given the majority of LinkedIn users [now log-in via the mobile app](https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/linkedin-now-has-414-million-members-with-57-of-traffic-coming-from-mobile/), providing a simple response option makes sense. It just feels like everything's becoming the same on each, that all the platforms are merging into one.

Is that a good thing? I guess it means that learned, habitual behavior can be utilized across each platform, which may make it easier to adapt to each. But it also feels like maybe we're losing something in the mix.¬†¬†

Regardless, the truth will be in the usage - if it helps increase LinkedIn engagement, then it's a good move for the platform.¬†

*LinkedIn Reactions are rolling out from today.*

philosophy,"I believe we are being played. Collectively, and individually. Even the idea of freedom, as we see it in America, is part of the game. The most insidious part of the game. When you ask yourself, what does it mean to be free? One might think, to be able to move around. To not be imprisoned. To not be controlled against one‚Äôs own will. But that raises another question, what is will? It is this question that inevitably leads you to realize the limits of your freedom, even in a place like America. It is this question, that will make you realize the failings of modern existentialists to realize the beauty in an idea like the great refusal,  √† la Herbert Marcuse. Or perhaps more correctly point out how they are failing to refuse, that they do not understand what it is to truly deconstruct. It is this idea of refusal that is essential to understand if one truly wants to consider themselves an existentialist, and that the logical full extent of existentialism is individual sovereignty. Today in America we see groups of people who wish to tear down the tyrannical structure of the west. They see this as the refusal, they believe in the idea of revolution through force, without understanding that through the use of force, their new idealism is not a symbol of refusal, but the next iteration of oppression. It does not symbolize willpower overcoming institutionalized power, rather the sublimation of will into institutional power. Refusal dose not seek approval from the critic. Are you free if you need your thoughts and ideas sanctioned by the government? Are you free if you need benefits from the government? Or are you a child, sucking at their mother‚Äôs teat? What does it mean if we look down on the poor and displaced, and say that they are mere children, destined to suck on teats? How do we inspire will to individual sovereignty, true freedom, rather than define each other as victims of a cruel world with no way out, destined to grow thin on the milk of our overextended mother? The shells are group identity, and the ball, our individual sovereignty, is lost. Constantly shuffled between group identities to avoid exercising willpower. To avoid the fact that if we choose to find it, we are left with duty and responsibility."

philosophy,"Im curious if anyone has come across this site before www.actualfreedom.com.au
The author's underlying message is that we have a feeling of being at our core(self), and overlaying that is a social identity.
 The self is instinctual in nature, and is rained in by social conditioning, forming an ego, a social identity.
 Because of an instinctual fear of death the  self can, through the mammalian brain, invent afterlives (ego death for the east or heaven for the west), but a death of the self can also happen.
 When that occurs the resulting awareness is that one underlying it all one is actually the sences, quoted as ""i am the physical universe experiencing itself as a body"".
 It's a large, user unfriendly site, and too hard to compress meaniningfully here, but i wonder what anyone who has the time (and patience to dig through enough to understand the premise) thinks of it."

**Preface**

There is believed to be a being- an Idea- a structure with which all has been born that may very well manifest itself atop the highest echelon of Occam‚Äôs Razor. This entity, which will hereafter be named the ‚ÄúKing of Kings‚Äù, is, or contains, the ultimate truth\- That which produces action. Although it manifests itself within everything- it strangely has yet to be discovered in clarity; but with our newly wedded introspection we may be able to gasp it- if it allows our hands so. Its complexities arise as consciousness arrived forcing dismemberment into endless and uneven portions: gods. And so it seems we must piece the King of Kings back together by extracting truths from its latter.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems we know of the King of Kings but not of where he lay. How may it be that we make able ourselves to find him? Only but clues are derived from our inherited gods‚Äì but alas it seems a slope too slick to navigate as it leads to many downward spirals of our own makings. While it seems as though the King of Kings rests just out of our eyesight, could it be that the crowned king of introspection put forth a trial through a cross-examination of our inherited gods and introspection itself? And if we were to find the King of Kings what would then become of us? Or is it that the strong are bound to search for an eternity while the weak are left to kill him?

&amp;#x200B;

*^(Introspection- Self awareness)*

*^(Proper adaptation- That which aligns your own or other‚Äôs behaviors closer to the King of Kings)*

*^(Push to prevail- a need for change within parameters of our natural law spawned from introspection)*

*^(Good-that which either promotes or is ‚Äúproper adaptation‚Äù)*

*^(Evil- that which aligns your own or other‚Äôs behavior further from the king of kings)*

*^(King of Kings: That which manifests itself into the highest echelon of Occam‚Äôs Razor: God of Gods)*

*^(Gods- beings ideas or structures that which we allow to govern our actions; that which contains fragments of the King of Kings)*

*^(King of introspection- Any person abled to discover the King of Kings through introspection)*

*^(Strong: People who seeks the King of Kings for fear of hell, people who understand the necessity of a true god)*

*^(Weak: People who dismiss anything outside of their leisure: fools)*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*It seems many of this world have killed god and seized the throne and their new gods are but demons dressed in white. They worship themselves and they see that it is good. And how may the thinker interject if they claim his beard a trophy kill? The more extinct the religious grow the closer the townsmen move towards winter masked in the scent of blooming flowers. Soon enough the town will be split with what one can not decipher be wine or blood--but it will remain the best of times until the truth unfolds. If no action is taken, Spring will no longer exist and all that creeps and crawls will swallow the man including himself.*"

philosophy,A statement that I have found rather truthful in my experiences with various people groups.
philosophy,"I'm hoping for somebody to help me elaborate and research some thoughts that I've had recently. I'm sure I'm not the first person to think about any of this so I'd like to know what has been said about these ideas before.

This started off as a simple idea years ago that sounds like a kind of fake deep revelation but it's interesting the closer you examine the idea. I thought was originally: what if you were to die, mentally, inside your head, your consciousness and your soul (if you'll allow) just clock out one second and you're replaced by another person inhabiting your body; another consciousness -- another soul. That new person is not you and only came into existence in that moment; believes it has existed your whole life and is you because it has your memories a sense of selfhood and a sense of existing at a point in time in its life. I thought, what if this happens every time you fall asleep and wake up again. I found this terrifying.

The kind of obvious next thoughts are: what if this happens continually and doesn't that just describe our experience of existing?  are we not dying in a sense every time our mind drifts off and are we not also continually coming into existence with each new established thought. In this understanding our memory is the one thing that allows us to have a sense of self, without memory each thought and each perception is a self terminating ambition. 

If you think about things this way our experience of time in an immediate sense, moment to moment, is extremely important and the foundation of how we should think about the nature of being and consciousness. 

To me it makes sense to think of this in comparison to Solipsism. Solipsism is a particular way of an individual understanding their sense of being and self along the theoretical continuum of selfhood: The self vs. (the) other(s). The idea I described above is an individual understanding their sense of self and being in relationship to the experience of time which we might see as a continuum as we would self vs. other. The term that came to mind for this is ""Temporal Solipsism"" which according to a google search appears to have been used to describe related ideas.

In instances when I've had too much weed, I've gone into panic because of even very minor changes in my sense of time and memory. I become more aware of how thoughts and ideas fade into obscurity as time passes and because of this my sense of being is really damaged. When thoughts go nowhere and are forgotten immediately then in the subsequent moment were aware that we just lost time. In a sense we died for a moment. I have a particular fear around stuff like this. As a side note I wonder if it has to do with having ADD or a particular neurodivergence, since it's fair to say that the manner in which one of processes information and forms thoughts and memory is functionally slightly different with ADD) 

 The more I think about it now the more it makes sense to think of our sense of self-awareness, of consciously being in the current moment and of being aware of our sentience is, as an experience of juggling the memory of a moment before and the emergence of new thoughts to form a construct that we interpret as being. This construct is a vehicle that moves the sense of self through time. This construct is constantly taking on new experiences, new created ideas, and new logical discoveries and at the same time  it is constantly losing information as the vividness of each new perception immediately fades in memory. The machinery of this machine connects thoughts and forms supporting structures to organize and compartmentalize our perceptions into an understanding that can enter our long term memory and interface with future moments of being.

Sorry for all that rambling but what theories/philosophers should I be reading. Heidegger and Prior seem like people I should maybe look into."

philosophy,"Alright people of Reddit, so my girlfriend recently got into an argument with me about the merits of the justice system and the whole""innocent until proven guilty"" thing and how it makes getting a conviction when it comes to rape charges nearly impossible. Her belief was that when it came to rape cases (specifically marital or between partners) was that the system should work on probability rather than innocent until proven guilty, and that they should simply convict people based on the probability the woman was telling the truth (or rather the percentage of women statistics deems tell the truth in any given rape case would be the percentage of convictions) at random. I obviously disagreed and we got into a huge fight about it and I'd like to hear everyone's opinion on this.

philosophy," 

Bethany Hamilton said it well when she said ‚ÄúCourage doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get afraid. Courage means you don‚Äôt let fear stop you‚Äù.

Fear, one of the most powerful word that has made many people tip toed in life, the word has rendered others powerless and living below their capabilities.

‚ÄúEverything you want is on the other side of fear.‚Äù Jack Canfield. Most people live in the context of the opinion of others; Family, Friends, Spouse etc.

A philosopher once said the people you look up to sometimes look down on you. They devalue your capabilities, Aspiration and Dreams, sometimes unintentionally or unknowingly.

Whatever you need to create a better life for yourself is within you. A cub does not force itself to be something else in the jungle. It already has the character of a lion, the king of the jungle. The lion is not the smartest animal, nor the biggest animal in the jungle but the character and the mindset of the lion to prey on other animals makes it the king in the jungle.

philosophy,"The beginning of modern philosophy has suffered a fate of misunderstanding. Several generations of the brightest of minds from the soil of the Germans have been led astray in their misunderstanding of the co-constitutive program of modern philosophy. These Germans, these brightest of minds, have been confused and thereby unable to penetrate into the program of modern philosophy that has only had a fledgling beginning. This program being what we can read for ourselves in Descartes‚Äô Discourse on Method. Let‚Äôs cut to the chase. What was missing in the brightest of German minds? In their Christianity, whether for or against? Kabbalah. The brightest of the Germans were unable to make any progress into the program of modern philosophy because the program is co constituted through Aristotle and Kabbalah, as equals, upon a new foundation for human knowledge. The program, still unfinished, and even worse forgotten to the world, is to found out of Greek and Hebrew thinking a foundation for science and a foundation for ethics. This dual founding our German minds were unable to perceive thereby constituting in the words of one of them an actual forgetfulness. All so called philosophy after those Germans are no longer with bright minds but dullards in their shadows, shadows that are of a forgetfulness of an original program! Thus, the beginning of modern thinking is with kabbalah and Greek together. Anyone who wishes to think on the true path of philosophy must take off from here, from the belonging of Kabbalah and Aristotle. Let this be then a critical remark but more so an advertisement for philosophy to return again into our world, our modern world.  True philosophy is to begin not with the misunderstandings of the Germans, those great bright minds, and far from any of those dullards in their shadows, but to begin again with Kabbalah and Aristotle. In short, to recommence the original program and only program of modern philosophy. The Greek and Hebrew word as equals."

The world of politeness, distraction, pleasure consumption, and social conformity seems harmless, but that's where the terror lies. This seemingly benign go with the flow attitude subtly rips out the soul of the person. Since most people are the similar (simple/lacking introspection) and typical social interactions are superficial, no one can really tell that someone's sense of self/spirit/intuition has been replaced by a fake ego/personality. Even when the victim/soulless one start to realize something is terribly wrong, it provides extra motivation to become even more fake, manipulative, to really reinforce that their fake/ego self is indeed real/powerful.

**HOW?**

Politeness acting in accordance with social etiquete taught by schools, businesses, family, media etc. Something that we lemmingly accept as civilized. Yet, how many hours of the day are we required to be polite and how many people are treating us politely? Over time, the polite behavior is going to be considered the natural self, and the natural self is going to become so distant as it will actually feel uncomfortable to be oneself. In addition, if people are constantly being polite, it's polite to be polite back to them, and if you're not it could be considered potentially offensive that the fake behavior is not reciprocated.

Distractions abound in this world. One can endlessly talk about sports teams, moving up the corporate ladder, have frivolous friendships to talk about sports teams and moving up the corporate ladder, hobbies, home improvement, etc. The distractions allow a person never to not introspect, to analyze their purpose, or why they do the things they do. All we have to do is keep busy and look like everyone else and be polite with a quirky phrase here or there from a television show.

Pleasure consumption deadens the conscious. Alcohol, sex, cigarettes, massages, eating, shopping, energy protein vitamin drinks and anything else to temporarily feel good and to busy the mind away with a sense of accomplishment through a steady stream of dopamine kicks. The only thought that needs to occur is another dopamine kick.

There can't be a problem if everyone else is doing it? Human's take cue from the people around. This is a perfectly normal and healthy thing to do except when there are potentially very little mentally independent functioning human beings. Eventually, healthy people become the dangerous ones as they being themselves will throw the monotone happiness systems for a loop.

Taking all these factors into consideration along with my personal life experience. I find it almost guaranteed with all these factors that people will naturally erode down into this one dimensional monotone happiness soul. All the external incentives are to be happy go along to get along person and then the consciousness is fed a consistent stream of stimulus and worthless information to process to keep the mind off any deeper matters.

**WHY?**

As far as I can tell it's a natural evolution of single minded convenient thought and the competitive driven nature of the economy.

**SOLUTIONS**

1. Over time new generations realize the absurdity of previous generations assumptions and their unavoidable stupidity, and we start to organize naturally and evolve out of this mess with new dynamic doctrines that depend on self-governing aware people that understand that creating an environment for sustaining the human spirit as the most important prerogative rather then big economic numbers that motivate people to take as much as they can to attain a sense of accomplishment which actually screws them.
2. We all learn to be higher functioning happy slaves and it's really not so bad after all. Teamwork baby.
3. Population morale slowly degrades as the propaganda and enticements become less and less effective as the quality of relationships/friendships continually produce weaker and more disconnected people and we enter into some type of lame or horrifying Mad Max environment.
4. And whatever else people can be imagined.

philosophy,"Yesterday I've finally published a monumental musical work which I've been working on for two years and I had to write a short essay to explain it, as the piece is also an answer to a modern cultural-philosophical problematic.

I. PHILOSOPHY


**Preface**

In considering the overall length of this musical trilogy which goes under the title of ‚ÄúGeo Cycle‚Äù, a trilogy of about 6 hours, surely one will be suspicious about its artistic meaning and will start wondering what‚Äôs behind such huge musical material and such devotion.
This written acts as an introduction to a work which is really the product of a very long philosophical transition and activity, during the which came up a defined and complex structure which at the end has been translated into music. Without an introduction, without a written comment about the ‚ÄúGeometrica‚Äù, these thousands of notes won‚Äôt be able to be properly enlightened. Also they won‚Äôt be ‚Äúfeel‚Äù, but this is a miracle that this written certainly with a lot of doubts will be able to accomplish. Certainly not today, not with us post-moderns.


**Nietzsche and modernity**

At the age of 17 I started working on a peculiar kind of book, one where I would write anything about what surrounds me and what my reasonings are on any object in particular. I also started getting into philosophy and this was going in step with my new project. My musical activity began earlier, as I was studying music and then started writing some modest pieces on a musical software; but it‚Äôs in this period that I began listening to classical music and discovering a richness of sound that I couldn‚Äôt find before in any other genre. Here‚Äôs then how these two worlds initially had begun to cohabit and develop together. And in answering ‚ÄúWhat is the Geometrica?‚Äù we‚Äôll need to take in account the link between these two subject, because music and philosophy here are practically inseparable.
And they were two inseparable subject also for Nietzsche. My first encounter with Nietzsche occurred many years before I started writing and composing, and became very serious when I curiously found a book of his complete works in a dilapidated cottage on the outskirts of the small town where I grew up. I later became one of those rare connoisseurs that have read his diaries, the epistolary, the posthumous fragments, Carl Paul Janz‚Äôs tomes and Massimo Fini‚Äôs biography. I always sensed a really ambiguous condition among the social environments since I was in school, where I started wondering about the phenomenon that secretly were occurring behind the interpersonal relationships. There‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve read that talked about the issues I was wondering about: until I read Nietzsche. After I found the words ‚Äútiredness‚Äù, ‚Äúgravity‚Äù, ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù and especially ‚Äúd√©cadence‚Äù, and especially after I read the Zarathustra, I finally realised that Nietzsche was the only one who could‚Äôve helped me get on the top of this ‚Äúmodern problematic‚Äù, as I needed, rather than a philosopher, the help of a great psychologist.
To be fair one has to ask himself if anyone has ever seriously observed the XX century through Nietzsche‚Äôs lenses, him that has barely been able to see the first months of the new century. Because if his century has been a great turning point or great arrival point of nihilism, the XXth century has been the great field on which the social-cultural phenomenon described in his written have developed, matured, rotted, manured the ground of the new modern civilisation. The issue that concerns us the most is that nobody seems to have realised that such issue even exists. We have numerous academics that compare Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy with the present events, that demonstrate in which way Nietzsche had already placed a critical background for the issue of modernity ‚Äì but did we really go to the bottom? Have we really understood all what happened in the past thirty years and all what is happening today?
Part of the issue for which is difficult to understand the XXth century and its implications for contemporary history following Nietzsche‚Äôs footsteps, is the fact that it still appears that we don‚Äôt understand what is the key of his thought, what is the main concern of this great psychologist. His lack of faith towards the philosophic-academic field redeems itself through the fact for which at today philosophers and academics talk about topics that barely scratch the core of his message: for instance, I‚Äôve noticed that the most popular topic is the so called ‚Äúmaster-slave morality‚Äù, which is found in a book that more than the Zarathustra deserves to be considered an ‚Äúalchemical trick‚Äù. It‚Äôs verily this so disregarded topic the only one that can be use as a key to understand modernity and its implications. Many today sense a problem in the XXth century, sense the attitude, decline, lowness, but they seem not to have the adequate tools in order to observe with transparency through the fog of the historical pollution caused by the great machinery of the t√©chnƒì.
‚ÄúGod is dead!‚Äù: we always question the meaning and implications of this famous sentence, yet there‚Äôs still a lot of intimate material behind it which yet seems being moved aside. The question that has to be our main concern is: at which level stands the importance of this concept in Nietzsche‚Äôs life? And we can find out that it stands at the top one, at the level on which all the dynamics of the personal events of his life has been decided. Nietzsche, with such brisk, vernal, clean, playful, unwavering and especially honest writing: such personality couldn‚Äôt have resented of an environment always more heavy, foggy, mournful, rhetoric, dishonest. In few words a modern environment ‚Äì in one word d√©cadent. Nietzsche, the only one that has ever dived to the bottom and came back to the surface without getting weakened.
‚ÄúGod is dead!‚Äù: and this is just the beginning. Any philosopher could lose himself among the phenomenal chain of sophisticated events that have shaped the past century. First of all, to respect the nihilist path that culture was crossing, the man of the last century had to make a step ‚Äúavant‚Äù thus arriving to the comforting arms of the avant-garde movements. Art now was refolding on itself, observing its own creating, contorting, wriggling and gaggling. Today culture meets a general repudiation, to make space to the constant rising of ‚Äúliquid entertainment‚Äù (as Bauman would call it), but it‚Äôs here, at the beginning of the XXth century, that art initially became twisted and shaped into this new foggy and martyrial process of disinterested creation, where the artist wants to express nothing but void, and nothing has changed for the past 150 years. The two world wars sure have not helped at all, but intensified the sense of ‚Äúvoid‚Äù characteristic of modernity. At the same time the fatal event of the technical explosion: the ground and every certainty fall, the machinery saves us, gives us hope, overcomes us. We can see that here, necessarily, next to the great tiredness of modern man, an extreme reaction has to occur like a ball that bounces and reaches the other extremity of the height that is produced. As the great product of the nihilism, the uncertainty, the non-sense, we have the exaltation: this generation, more than any other in the history, feels over-excited, exalts itself obsessively, exaggerates as a reaction to the unbearable sensation of ‚Äúvoid‚Äù. God is dead, technology has arisen and sugar.. ‚Äì ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too much sugar in our diet‚Äù. As a dietician, Nietzsche would‚Äôve surely been enthusiast in observing mankind today had he lived 100 years longer, besides having the possibility of showing sociologists and psychologists of today the answer to their question ‚ÄúWhat leads todays‚Äô generation to this complex situation?‚Äù.
Among these great and sophisticated events and also inventions the last century has seen being developed, the internet is probably the one that rises above the others for being the most crucial ‚Äì as it‚Äôs the final completion of the path of the great fall. First, the internet can be seen as a compendium of the technological struggles of the modern era that all aim to the fundamental need of ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. The information, knowledge and experience provided by the internet completely twisted and carved the social architecture and individual psychological framework. Now the information is not to be sought, it comes from everywhere at anytime; now knowledge doesn‚Äôt meet the understanding of the individual, rather it forces him to itself; now the experience is not acquired by growing, rather by watching the others experiencing. What we have, then, is a generation which grew up by learning an exaggerate amount of information, an unnecessary amount of it and especially at the wrong time. In this perspective internet can‚Äôt be certainly regarded as a tool that helped the amelioration of humanity. But then the technical dogmatism doesn‚Äôt even require ‚Äúbecoming better‚Äù, no one is interested in any amelioration and probably Zarathustra is still the ‚Äúfirst and only‚Äù today to have wondered:

&gt;The most careful ask to-day: ‚ÄúHow is man to be maintained?‚Äù Zarathustra however asketh, as the first and only one: ‚ÄúHow is man to be surpassed?‚Äù

Having observed these aspects of internet‚Äôs technology and watching around us at our most recent generations, maybe one will be finally put into a more stable perspective and clearer notice how powerful and sophisticated are the consequences of such technology. One can then find a terrific precision in the prediction of Zarathustra, where he notices how our generation has became gloomy after having spent some time in the forest of knowledge which internet is:

&gt;Gloomy did this hunter return from the forest of knowledge

And so the issue here strikes us in all its transparency: while all the academics are still discussing over the √úbermensch, the eternal return and the master-slave morality, it appears that the problem of the *d√©cadence* ‚Äì which all Nietzsche‚Äôs works after the Zarathustra are about ‚Äì is the most crucial and actual topic of modern history. After realizing how a whole century that has screamed *‚Äúd√©cadence!‚Äù* in the most terrifying way has passed unnoticed by the philosophical world, we can‚Äôt find ourselves anymore to disagree with Nietzsche‚Äôs reserves for philosophers and academics. If philosophy hasn‚Äôt noticed the greatest issue of the century, then what art could‚Äôve possibly done? With Nietzsche today we could say, unlikely being subject to mistake, that all our culture today is a culture of *d√©cadence*.


**Genealogy of the d√©cadence**

We will dedicate here just an introduction of a genealogy of d√©cadence that we can retrace back to the great events of the last century; because one could really go deeper into the comprehension and disentangling of such epochal phenomenon as no one has done before ‚Äì because no matter how much do I search, we still don‚Äôt have articles, bools, essays, people that clearly demonstrate being knowledgeable about a contemporary problem that already Nietzsche has brought to light.
Although we‚Äôre going to trace back a genealogy of d√©cadence starting from the arising of internet, we aren‚Äôt saying anything that Nietzsche hasn‚Äôt already told us yet one century ago:

&gt;And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of their works. A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: 'All is empty, all is alike, all hath been!'
[‚Ä¶] All our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. All the ground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow!
Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?'
 
This is one of the most intense and passionate passages of the Zarathustra, a monumental pearl that represents the summa of the struggles of modernity: and at the end it seems that the ‚Äúspirit of gravity‚Äù has won the battle. It‚Äôs alarming how much philosophers today resemble to the populace: for both, this passage is simply beautiful and profound. And I don‚Äôt think it will be totally understood in our time: it doesn‚Äôt matter how well do we acknowledge the concept, says Nietzsche ‚Äì to feel it one has to be an abyss of profundity. To feel these words it means to keep encountering it in any place you could go to, on the streets, in the shops, in school, in television ‚Äì every place is a new occasion to demonstrate that nothing today is exempt from the trend of nihilism.
Notwithstanding the fact that the generation born in the 90s or in the new millennium didn‚Äôt experience at all the gloomy cultural years of the second after-war, it maintains a peculiar suffered reverence for that ‚Äúhumanitarian cause of rebellion‚Äù against tradition that our generation thinks has been something completely new and innovative in the last century, forgetting about the forefather Dadaist movement at the cultural base of said century. And I define those years ‚Äúgloomy‚Äù because of the way in which the artistic expression became increasingly characterised by a mournful, dark, foggy, romantic song. The explosion between the 70s and the 90s of the ‚Äúmusical bands‚Äù had hugely influenced the cultural developed of the most recent years, thus producing an incredible effect that probably has passed right under the nose of all our contemporary sociologists, philosophers and psychologists: the phenomenon of this gloomy culture and its encounter with internet and the turning point of the metaphysical experience ‚Äì there you go, the new millennium is ready to be served! I can‚Äôt think of a proper comprehension of contemporaneity without having realised these huge phenomena and the cultural plots of the past fifty years. 
To honour these tragic years which the generation of this millennium hasn‚Äôt even experienced, the youngest cultural-artistic environments had taken a path for which they imitate the stylistic practices and features of their terribly worshipped idols: the microphone closer to the mouth, more intimately, covered by the hand, to hide, a more inhibited voice, words are more confused, timid, the texts is more twisted, the effects cover the vocal sound, to mystify, letters are weakly marked as to make space for verses of sorrow. A good psychologist, after having read these analyses and having observed which words here come to light, would have already clearly realised the complete picture of the situation: inhibition, concealment, darkness, confusion, contortion, retreat, surrender. And I‚Äôm here the first to come up with a final diagnosis: that music today is at the end a great funeral canticle dedicated to God‚Äôs dead. Apparently no one has had ears good enough to hear what kind of music is played today, probably because deafened by the noise that music emanates today, as a shriek caused by the brutal blow received.
But to go even deeper, to understand completely the modern western civilisation, one has to deal with what has been probably the most important event of the last century.

&gt;Between 1900 and 2000, the increase in world population was three times greater than during the entire previous history of humanity‚Äîan increase from 1.5 to 6.1 billion in just 100 years.

This is the situation presented by the researchers Roser e Ortiz-Ospina in an article about the increasing of the world‚Äôs population a couple of years ago. Such terrifyingly rapid expansion had such complex, powerful and sophisticate impact that I suspect we still are far for the comprehension of the whole phenomenon itself and its implications. We can analyse the event following an organised path: increasing of the population, less possibility of self-affirmation, increasing of the possibility of our imperfections of being spotted, increasing of the possibility of being judged, increasing of the possibility of being loved as well as being hated (but we know that the negative is for a person source of higher concern), and similar phenomena. As a consequence of these we have just the features that we listed in the paragraph above on the musical hierarchy of the past century: ‚Äúinhibition, concealment, darkness, confusion, contortion, retreat, surrender‚Äù. Furthermore, as a reaction to such danger of being denied our self-affirmation, the individual today has came to defend himself by transforming into a subject with much more hard edges: at least regarding the west and its cities, the individual that arises today shows the very common and increasing features of irritability, nervousness, restlessness, irascibility, presumptuousness, obsessive suspicion towards the others. An individual today, to be ahead of the others and diminishing the risk of being blindsided, has to be aware of the possible criticism, and thus has to criticise himself ‚Äì then demonstrating to the others that he‚Äôs criticising himself, before starting demonstrating, again, of criticising his criticising himself, so to step ahead of the game! And this is what is commonly happening in the mind of the most contemporary individual, at an incredible speed and almost constantly during the day. For instance, we can think of one case in particular, PewDiePie, one of the most popular current individuals that are talked around, and we can take a look to his uploads on YouTube: the video opens, he screams, fakes and changes mood repeatedly, the video stops, restarts, becomes grey, zooms in, the audio stops, restarts, the picture twists, the colour changes, his expression, voice and gestures keep changing. We took him as an example just because he‚Äôs the most popular current trend and he suits best to represent a certain majority. So here we realise what‚Äôs coming up on the surface: the absurdity is in vogue, the continuous demonstration of not being apprehensible, the continuous changing direction because what‚Äôs static is more vulnerable. The current comicality, again, is based on these images that at the end represent but the void, the absurdity, the contortion ‚Äì and all these signals show us in which psychological condition the west currently stands. The ‚Äúmemes‚Äù are structured following a precise finality: distortion, mocking seriousness, hysterically screaming ‚ÄúOh pain! See how strong I am!‚Äù. Nietzsche thought he saw the worst in his century: he has seen the tiredness, what do we see today are the pathologic consequences of the exhaustion.
To conclude, now we can come to a definition of d√©cadent, helping ourselves with the analyses made above. I use the term d√©cadent in the way Nietzsche does, but including the hierarchy of the XXth century and especially the era of internet. D√©cadent is someone that has a sluggish and tired gait, half-closed eyes, harsh and bland voice. And we understand a d√©cadent better from his attitude: this individual necessarily puts up determined attitudes, demonstrates a certain type of hard condition, of distressed mood. Ironically he tries to show and think himself detached as much as possible from the eyes of the public, from the interest in the others, and in his attempt of detachment he demonstrates to the others is act of independency, thus maintaining this relationship. The d√©cadent, that is the most common type of individual in the west, twists whatever he has, from the body, to the words, to the interpersonal relationships, to his posts on the social networks. Everything bothers and tires him, because due to the television and internet he has already lived 5 times. And he‚Äôs the most common and increasing type of individual because his disinterestedness towards life is gets mistaken for confidence, assuring himself the others‚Äô respect. But here again Zarathustra already clearly described us the situation: the more you spit on life, the more ovation you receive. 
With the increment of million of people and the possibility, thanks to the media, of being seen by these people, our generation, as I already explained, put up a defensive mechanism already from the beginning: if you act tired and disinterested you have nothing to lose. The d√©cadent is already a winner, life can‚Äôt sneak up on him anymore ‚Äì at the same time life has lost most of its value, it has nothing valuable to offer anymore, and this is the price the d√©cadent has to pay for his cheat.


**The ontological models**

It is in London that, after a long philosophical process and development through the last years, the idea of the ‚Äúontological models‚Äù struck me, among the millions of people that inhabit the city and which gave me the fundamental intuition and final validation of my theses: that the ‚Äúontological models‚Äù are the actual anthropological Hyperuranion that shape the history and the world. The equation was that we know about the models and we see ourselves ‚Äì then we recognize our features and try to find the model which is compatible with them, finally identifying ourselves with that particular model. The world is a huge library of ontological models, one identifies himself in the one that presents his features and everything is tidied up, ready for the next individuals to come. After the realization of such phenomenon, it became clear that the history of the d√©cadence is necessarily linked to the history of the ontological models ‚Äì history which I myself tried to draw and define. ‚ÄúCan it be? That all the ontological models are alike? That everything is d√©cadent?‚Äù ‚Äì this is what I used to ask myself, being concern that I couldn‚Äôt find anything substantially confident against the ‚Äúspirit of gravity‚Äù.
For the decision of the nickname to use as an artist for my musical activity, I based myself on something merely aesthetical: I focused on the shape and aesthetics of the letters and it came up that ‚ÄúDeci‚Äù was the closer thing to the traits I was looking for, like naivety, lightness, liveliness, ultimately something elementary. Except for a musicologist I met long time ago, as well interested in philosophy, since I created Deci I never encountered a type of person that stood up differently from all the other types, or models ‚Äì to my perspective everything was just already too contaminated. Deci represents my efforts to create a model that summarily did not present the typical characters of the other models. Put it otherwise, we can say that Deci is an ‚Äúartificially created ontological model‚Äù, something our ontological tradition has met only once in its history with Nietzsche.
One day Geo arrives, hopping, smiling, completely radiating the entire venue. And not a sign of d√©cadence. I then created what became the ‚ÄúGeorema‚Äù or ‚ÄúTheorem of the three applications‚Äù, this absurd scientific adventure which later became a small biography of Geo. As she became so important to me, I decided to start working on something equally important that could‚Äôve represented her and be a dedication to this unique ontological model that affected me so much. And so I started working on the ‚ÄúGeorema‚Äù, a musical piece which takes the name from the little essay that narrates the story of my ‚Äúscientific adventure‚Äù. Subsequently, I decided to create a big musical work as a dedication to her and a continuation of this small initial piece. The coincidence between the name of Geo and my developed musical compositional methods and formal ideas is a fatality which, if not ""deep"", at least helps in getting a better picture.

If you're interested in the second part of the essay, mostly about ""music's today"", [here's the link](https://redd.it/bhccw4).
I'm not going to share the link of my musical work because it will seem I'm just here to promote, but if anyone's interested I'd be happy to share it.

### Culture, Ideas, and Laws

After  much deliberation and discussion when an idea is accepted by most  people and it becomes dominant it attains a coercive capacity. Here we  have to understand the difference between coercion and violence.  Consider a family. The elders control the behaviour of children, guiding  them to act in a socially conducive way. They stop children from  fighting, bullying, stealing from each other. Similarly, in the adult  world other people and society coerce us to act in certain ways ‚Äì these  range from traffic rules, etiquette in various settings to the clothing  and adornments we use. This is a universal human feature and is what  constitutes 'culture'. This is why the same biological animal ‚Äì homo  sapiens ‚Äì is found in a myriad of different behaviours, value systems  and so on in various places around the Earth. It is not the biological  differences among, let us say, the San bushman in Southern Africa, the  cattle rearing peoples in Tiber or agricultural peoples in ancient  Middle East but the cultural differences that distinguish them.

Culture  is but a set of dominant ideas that a society chooses to follow. In  every culture and sub-culture ranging from norms of conduct and  behaviour at the highest international gatherings or business meetings  to a high-school clique of friends, there is coercion and encouragement  to act in a certain way. Is this violence?

Among  the Hadza in Central-East Africa certain parts of an animal are eaten  only by 'epeme' men, men who undergo a certain ritual after adulthood,  and only with other 'epeme' men. This rule is scrupulously followed by  them. A piece of meat is allowed to rot rather than being eaten alone.  Is this violence?This means that in human society we can only take  decisions and act together regarding many aspects of our life and  interaction with others. The decisions do not pertain only to laws or  rules but also norms, customs, and traditions.

Not  only the actions we do but the very frame of thought, the set of  values, morals, and ideals are shaped by others and those of others are  in turn shaped by us. Ayn Rand seems to (maybe) agree that every act of  coercion or influence is not an act of violence. Particularly when it  comes to the workplace where all the main focus of human activity lies,  this question becomes important. Although it is through an agreement  that the employer and employed get into the arrangement of working  together, the question arises as to how this is enforced. Here again, we  come to the concept of power ‚Äì the force which can move and direct  people and production. In every relationship, agreement and social  behaviour the concept of power is important. This not only means  forcible or coercive behaviour as many think of but also the capacity to  influence, motivate and even propagandize and so on.

In  many cases we see employees not working properly and causing doom to  the organisation. In many other cases, we see the employer trying to  wriggle out of giving the proper benefits to the employees making their  lives miserable. Thus there is a constant struggle. This dichotomy of  cooperation and conflict is present in all human relationships and is  resolved through the application of power. This also includes the social  norms, culture and how dominant ideas influence people. Where power is  hijacked by some or is applied to further hate and violence it leads to  conflict. Where it is applied to further peace and love it leads to  cooperation.

### State, rule-making, and war nature

Earlier  we talked about Paramatma or super-soul, the conscious, decision making  part of human society including all the ideas influencing the people  and production and directing them. Power is the force or agency of the  'Paramatma' which compels us to act. The state is the actively  regulating and law enforcing part of society and as such one major  applier of power. In the most primitive hunter-gatherer societies, there  was no state. Similarly, in the far future, there may be no need for a  military, policy, bureaucracy or judiciary. But in all stages, humans  made and will make rules about their society and implemented/implement  them. At present we have an actively present state. While monopoly over  violence may be a feature of the state, it is not the primary function  or attribute of it. The main function of the state is making and  implementation of laws. This aspect of humanity ‚Äì making and  implementing laws is our most distinctive feature.  
We do not deny the  existence of war, violence, and domination in human relationships.  In-fact we place much more emphasis on this than Rand. Whereas Rand sees  violence as only physical and initiated by weapons ‚Äì we recognise that  war and enslavement have taken a softer form with the same  ramifications. In every relationship ‚Äì from that between wife and  husband, employer and employee, buyer and seller to that between  different governments ‚Äì there is constant cooperation and conflict. If  one party lets their guard down the other may immediately subjugate them  entirely. We observe couples where one partner completely dominates and  bullies the other. We observe how some countries completely dominate  and bully another country. Here the concept of dominant ideas comes into  play.

Here we need to distinguish  between the violence done to 'others' and peace and love enforced among  the group. In contrast to primate cousins like Chimpanzees hominids  evolved in an egalitarian and harmonious direction with the group  cooperating and self-regulating members NOT to dominate and steal from  those within the group. This ranged from monogamy in reproductive  partnerships to sharing of food gathered or hunted with all members  equally to the avoidance of domination and resolution of conflicts  peacefully ‚Äì distinct features in hominids including all hunter-gatherer  societies, in contrast to Chimpanzees and so on.

In  modern human societies these two aspects of human nature ‚Äì being good  to those within the group and being evil against 'others' ‚Äì are mixed.  So some decisions and rules and dominant ideas are good and some come  from violence and hatred. When the decision making process is hijacked  by vested interests or hate dominates society then wrong ideas become  dominant and also becomes laws. Even if we do not make any laws, the  making and propagating of dominant ideas keeps going on ‚Äì people  constantly influence and encourage and impose on others to behave in  certain ways. Here the influence of social movements and politics and  cultural trends becomes important. How to ensure good ones become  prevalent?

Not by abandoning making  rules and dominant ideas as Rand suggests. It is by democratic decision  making, by not letting the decision-making process getting hijacked by  some and by not succumbing to fundamentalism and always staying open to  new discussion and points of view.

  
Let us see how in the next part."

Why is this happening and to who benefits?Answer is simple: hive-mind  mentality and social constructs are easy to implement and to populate  for any kind of institutions. Add to the mix poor and unaffordable for  the majority of the population and available to the ‚Äúchosen few‚Äù  education system and you have an army of perfect modern day  ‚Äúwage-slaves‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

Consumer-based society with a single subconscious mindset is easier to  manipulate, than to work with individual mindsets separately. Those of  us who are smart, maintain integrity and are not willing to participate  in the social experiment called ‚Äúconsumer-based post-industrial society‚Äù  or have already tasted its bitterness are usually proclaimed as  ‚Äúoutcasts‚Äù by the majority with a huge subconscious sign: ‚ÄúYou shall not  enter outsider!‚Äù.  

&amp;#x200B;

A good reminder of thriller and horror flicks about isolated  communities in the woods who live by their own sets of rules and that  kind of mentality has unfortunately took over every major organization  worldwide.

That is today‚Äôs game for all. What will be the game changer for you individually? Simple:

**1.**¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Listen to yourself to understand and answer four questions:

* **Who do you want to be?**
* ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†**What do you want to do?**
* ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†**What do you want from life?**
* ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†**How do you want to get there?**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](f9fmqebii2v21)

 

**2.**¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Start to educate yourself, yes my friends,  internet is not only for trolling, videos of cute cats and dogs, with  updating statuses and pics on Facebook with Instagram. Internet is also a  great educational tool starting from Wikipedia and ending with  Guttenberg library, all in open access.

**3.**¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Be who you have always wanted to be and  don‚Äôt leave that for ‚Äúafter I finish that awful job‚Äù, university, get  divorced, buy a new car. Because that ‚Äúafter‚Äù may never come. Every day  you spend on this planet is your day and nobody else‚Äôs, use it wisely.

**4.**¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Focus on the activities and things that make  you feel passionate, driven and you actually want to do, even if they  don‚Äôt pay your bills just yet. Never give up on yourself and your  dreams.

Once you listen to yourself and understand yourself, you will find  other people who share the same or different beliefs and interests that  you do, but you will be united not by consumer-based hive-mind  mentality, but by your individuality. There is no ‚ÄúI‚Äù in ‚ÄúWe‚Äù, but there  is a ‚ÄúWe‚Äù in ‚ÄúI‚Äù.

One thing that's been bothering me lately is this general fascination with artificial ""intelligence"" and technological progress in general, and how machines (hardware and software) are supposed to have organic life like characteristics sometime in the future. As an engineer, I can't really see the continuity between, let's say, convolutional neural networks or self-driving cars or Boston dynamics robots, and organic intelligence and motor capabilities as seen in animals (and other life forms?). Since adding more sensors, more processing power and more motors seem to be limited by quantum mechanics if not just pure space constrictions. Are we maybe just railroaded into this thinking by futuristic ideas? Are we just ""sure"" that certain breakthroughs will happen? Or is there something to this prediction? Any authors touching this subject?

Please consider the following as a bias lens by I through us by the e in we and me.


How to trust in Kind;

Whoever you are,
Where ever you be,
I can trust you, 
You could trust me.

In all there seems love,
In all may be fear,
In some there is anger
To protect what is dear.

In Order are rules,
In Chaos but one,
In those who seem fools,
One may reach just fun

Surrounded by Trolls
In fear of the wicked
The only way; Drolls
Those that say
Feck it.

Can we ask life a joke?
How do you trick yourself into smiling.

One wants to look up
To find the auteur
Of that one finds good
And who'll beat despair.

One ought to look in
To find where each are
Those things that one is
But loves from afar.

The hunt for the knowing
That core of your soul
May be found in throwing
Away ones old shoes.

In most there is War
That breaking of Peaces
In some one finds floor,
Foundation that teaches.

By the Way,
You can Reason Backwards,
And in Circles.

By I in deed by my creed found by us.

Well,

philosophy,Publicly-Funded Superstition
philosophy,"Everyone here is likely familiar with the Trolley Problem and its Surgeon's Dilemma variant. A quick recap for those who are not in the following two paragraphs

In the trolley problem, one is presented with a situation wherein he or she must either pull or not pull a switcher for a train track. As it currently lies, the switcher will send the train down a track where five people are tied down, killing all five of them. If the switcher is pulled, it will send the trolley down an alternate track where a single person is tied, who will be killed.

In the Surgeon's Dilemma variant, one is present with a situation in which he or she is a surgeon with five patients, each of whom needs a different replacement organ without which they will soon die. He or she also has an appendicitis patient who is a donor match for all of the five (by strange coincidence). The surgeon can botch the appendectomy in such a way that it seems like an accident and harvest the five organs to save the five patients. What should the surgeon do?

In general (ignoring those who try to think up clever escapes from the thought experiments), people who are presented first with the trolley problem agree that pulling the switch is the morally superior course of action. However, they go back and question their original decision when they are subsequently presented with the Surgeon's Dilemma variant. They could not imagine that such action by the surgeon could be moral.

In Natural Law Theory, there are three kinds of actions from a moral perspective. There are intrinsically good, neutral, and evil actions. The doctrine of double effect states that someone may take an intrinsically good or neutral action, but not an intrinsically evil one, with the end goal of a net good, even if there is an evil side effect. Intrinsically evil actions are never permitted for any reason.

In the case of the Trolley Problem, the action taken is a neutral one. Flipping a switch is neither intrinsically evil nor intrinsically good. What matters, therefore, is the intention and the outcome. If the switcher switches the track because he wants the one to die, rather than because he wants to save the five, or vice versa, if he does not flip the switch because he wants one or more of the five to die, rather than to save the one, he acts wrongly. However, if he acts out of an intention to save lives, both actions, pulling the switch and not pulling the switch are morally permissible. And pulling the switch seems heroic, since it ultimately saves more lives.

On the other hand, under Natural Law Theory, killing an innocent person is intrinsically evil. It is *always* morally wrong to kill an innocent person (and even then, killing a person guilty of grave evils is only permissible in very specific circumstances by most natural law theorists), such as our appendectomy patient. Therefore, our surgeon acts wrongly if he does so, *even if* he intends to use that death to save a net of four people.

And so an appeal to the doctrine of double effect solves the Trolley Problem in such a way as to trample on the moral intuitions of as few people as possible, without inventing exceptions to existing ethical frameworks (eg rule utilitarianism to solve the Surgeon's Dilemma), which suggests that there is a strong correlation between Natural Law Theory and typical human moral intuitions. That this correlation exists implies that Natural Law Theory is likely the truest ethical theory (at least it is more likely true than Deontology or Consequentialism, which are typically used to evaluate the dilemmas), if moral intuitions count for anything at all."

philosophy,A short piece about how humans reason much better in familiar settings
philosophy,"I would argue that the real power and therefore direction in which we go, or in which our societies are heading, is dictated by the logic of profit and capital (of course this is highly simplified, there are of course other factors that influence our capitalist society or which help to sustain it). Power isn't in the hand of a few people at the stock market, I argue. But some people claim exactly this, that with the manipulation of the stock market of a few players, they have the ability to destroy a nation financially, therefore they have the power. The slovene philosopher Slavoj Zizek demonstrated this false view excellently in his book ""Violence"" 

Quote:

  ""Here we encounter the Lacanian differ¬≠ence between reality and the Real: ""reality"" is the so¬≠cial reality of the actual people involved in interaction and in the productive processes, while the Real is the inexorable ""abstract,"" spectral logic of capital that de¬≠termines what goes on in social reality. One can expe¬≠rience this gap in a  palpable way when one visits a country where life is obviously in shambles. We  see a lot of  ecological decay and human misery. However, the  economist's  report that  one reads afterwards in¬≠forms us that the country's economic situation is ""fi¬≠nancially sound"" -reality doesn't matter, what matters is the situation of capital ... Is this not truer than ever today? Do phenomena usually designated as those of virtual capitalism (the futures trade and  similar abstract  financial specula¬≠tions) not point towards the reign of the ""real abstrac¬≠tion""  at  its purest, far  more radical than in Marx's time? ""

If the power would be in the hand of a few people, like in feudalistic times, then, it would be easy to just replace them with better characters, with ""liberal communists"", so to give capitalism a social face, this as seen with Bill Gates, when his humanitarian charity, is only a way to over paint where his success hails from. Namely the same misery he is trying to fight, and his way of  operating is causing.  

Do you agree or disagree? Lets have a discussion on what power in today society is."

After which I had a funeral service for my dog. I gave a eulogy after which I didn't feel guilty about my decisions leading up to his death. It was cathartic. I got his bark inked on my chest, I gave away almost all his belongings, made an urn for him, decorated my house with his pictures and finally started grieving him. I missed him everyday. Everything around me reminded me of him. I cried, but they were small tears and stopped quite easily. My mom got him in her dreams. My brother and dad seemed to move on very quickly. But, I was stuck in this void. I wasn't sad or happy, I was numb. I started punched the punching bag in my gym and became quite good at, in fact last night I was so filled with anger I went to gym just to punch it and I didn't stop. Just didn't stop. I bought a bottle of port wine and a packet of cigarettes. I played lovely by billie ellish and love of my life by queen on repeat. Drank away the alcohol and smoked around 8 cigarettes. I made a few calls of help.My friends picked up and gave me advice and tried to calm me. It didn't matter.No one was there for me in that moment other than myself. I puked a couple of times, came to my bed and slept. And it was good sleep. I woke up feeling refreshed. I didn't get the experience I wanted at all. I wanted to connect with my dog, tell him I am sorry and just have people all around me taking care of me. I wanted the attention,love and care so bad. So fucking bad.  I didn't get it. Not one bit. Instead I made quite a fool of myself. People in the gym think I have serious rage issues. My friends think I am nut case. Worst of all I didn't get the connect with my dog at all. The one I thought I was doing all of this for. Which isn't true. Not one bit. I did it for myself, I wanted to feel pain and suffer , I felt it and I suffered.  I really did however I got something more of out of it. I think I got closure. That sometimes death just means death. And nothing more. That he just isn't coming back no matter I do or say. I have to accept the situation and create a new world. A world that does not include him. And I know for a fact that I can do it. Cause last night I realized I was enough. I didn't need people to help me. I mean support it great. But worthless if you don't feel like you are enough. I think I am ready to start this chapter of my life, on my own."

They betrayed me, stabbed me in the back. None of this was fitting with the image I had of the world and when it happened I was so disappointed I chose to separate myself from others because of disgust, a sense of betrayal and because of fear. 

It‚Äôs been about 6 years since my last real human interaction. It‚Äôs more safe. But it‚Äôs driving me crazy. I began to understand I need other people in my life so I'm wondering how I could deal with what happened.

I‚Äôm wondering if there is any book (or anything) that talks about the disappointment one may have with humankind in general  and how to go past that to keep on living normally, amongst other people even though they may be horrible human beings.

philosophy,"Empathy is a choice.

Sociopathy is a choice. I don't mean that people can suddenly choose not to have the cards stacked against them, but that empathy itself is a choice in the first place.

Let's say that someone has something physically wrong with their brain that they can't ""feel"" empathy. Actually, let's resort to the common fear of saying they have no emotions, which is absolutely not true and serves to justify calling them less than human. So we as people wanting control say that this person is incapable of feeling anything, but that is because these feelings can't be explained, an individual must choose to feel them in the first place. Say our person has an MRI. ""Oh, it looks like they weren't feeling empathetic, that means they are incapable."" Well, IANAD, but I'm sure if I was completely enraged and or afraid then the ""empathetic part of my brain"" wouldn't exactly jump for joy.

But it's genetic, they say. Maybe some people are born angry. I've met one. It's still a choice how they deal with it. Okay, maybe they are born feeling NOTHING. Then how are they still alive? Emotions are the basis for everything we do. A very wise man told me pain is largely an emotional reaction. If that's true, then anything done to lessen the pain if hunger was done via an emotional MOTIVATION. We all share this because we are all alive.

My intent is not to justify anything, just to put it into perspective. Consistent and intense feelings of despair, loneliness, sadness, anger, and fear could easily convert any ""normal"" person into someone who looks like a sociopath, and it all depends on how they handle those emotions.

One popular conception is that these people find release in harming others, which makes sense for someone who is constantly afraid.

What I base this on is the idea of free choice. If a sociopath is someone who is incapable of feeling empathy, then I should be incapable of NOT feeling empathy. Empathy is not even a feeling, it's what naturally needs to happen if two intelligent beings are to work together. Nothing says, ""don't work with anybody"" like constantly feeling an unexplainable feeling all the time that only gets lessened when others aren't around. Empathy is a behavior, not an emotion.

Any ideas?"

I'm in pain because he says things like hold people who think differently in higher esteem and envy as good, but are we supposed to do this because it's a command even if it feels difficult or is it supposed to be believed in or something else. Also people who agree with most of what he says do they then act out his philosophy. And how if it just hurts your head to ""fight against oneself"" How do you fight against oneself. What if you find it difficult to believe or agree with Nietzsche but want to. Like if fighting against oneself made him think envy is good what if it hurts your head to believe or think this because of your ego or something. Like how can I just agree with it like others do because for me it's fucking my brain because I don't know why I should believe it because he tells us when wouldn't it be better for you to find more yourself through thinking because then you will naturally feel it because now he seems too right and that I'm just a weak pathetic person to not believe in his stuff because that's how opposing it is to  people because of their psyche. And isn't it supposed to be like life philosophy and that if you believe his philosophy you have to actually be true and have transfiguration or something. What i mean is that if you were a person who self deceived and he reveals in his philosophy that you deceive yourself and that it's bad it's hard to do anything but hurt off you don't just change instantly as a person and agree. I mean I think that's it's hard to swallow. Impossible so it causes so much mental pain. Because again the ego or something that like pushes back. This is fucking hard for me to articulate.

philosophy,"I consider this to be the right subreddit to leave this post under. 

I consider myself highly anti-pc, not because I am asshole, but because I believe that everyone who follows that ideology does not allow for intellectual discourse. I support every liberal cause: abortion, marijuana(even psychedelic drugs) and I even support the regularization of big business. I also don't believe that corporations should look into your private life when hiring you; I see this as a way for the corporations to control you and keep you producing for them. I hate every government branch that tells you what to do in your own private time, which now seems to me is every branch. You cannot even post what you want on instagram because someone felt offended. Just because you are offended does not mean that you are right. 

I digress. 

I decided to take a women and gender studies class this semester and everyone in that class just seemed to hate men that did not agree with them. They thought of babies as parasites, which angers me. I support abortion because it is up you what do you with your life. In the end, you are the one who has to deal with the guilt and sorrow that comes along with killing a baby. The fetus has a life, and so when we talked about this in my class I tried to explain to them that, in order to describe the sperm and the egg as being ""alive or dead"" we would first need to define what life is. This is a ""louder with crowder"" technique. Very effective nonetheless. I do not believe that anyone has the right to take away a life, but again, you are the one who has to deal with the guilt. My professor dismissed this thought as ""food for thought."" This angered me because she did not even have the common courtesy, as a professor, to even consider the fetus as a living being. It is a completely valid question and because, in my personal experience, feminists look at fetuses as ""parasites,"" leads me to believe that they just do not want to deal with the guilt. Treat the baby as an object and everything will be fine. Feminists were fetuses at some point. 

Men are not trying to tell you what to do with your bodies. This is a fallacy. We just don't think it's ok for you to dehumanize a baby for the sake of having peace of mind. We are telling you what to do with the baby's life, which is a body completely divorced from yours. 

""Pro-lifers only care about the baby until it is out of the womb."" Not true. No one is forcing you to take care of it. Take responsibility for your actions and put it up for abortion, just because your little boyfriend decided to not use a condom now you think you are right in killing babies. Give it up for adoption or something else. 

My point is the following: Women and gender studies class teach people to hate men, treat babies as objects, and teach students to not discuss ideas. This is scary because they are being fed this narrative that everyone is against them. It is even more scary because they are being taught this. 

I do not consider myself a conservative, but it angers me when these liberals and leftists want to tell people what to think, what to believe, and what to say. I am for freedom of speech. 

Just like Rousseau stated in his book, ""A discourse on Inequality,"" 
""People need to be fit to be free."" 

It seems to me no one in this country is fit to be free, which is why they want socialism so that the government helps them stay in this state of perpetual adolescence.

I always wondered (mostly in cases when I cannot force things and change anything) about what is destiny, is it really exists or its just another excuse for thing that happened in life like ‚Äûwhatever seems like it is supposed to happen‚Äú convincing yourself that you had no will and choice to change outcome. ‚ÄûDestiny‚Äú. By the other hand ‚Äûwe are there, where we are and it is best for us‚Äú, I dont mean that human are not able to change anything in his life, human can change his life in micro circumstances like go to buy stuff, travel etc. but in macro aspects human probably cannot do anything. All situations and events in life looks like randomized but if you think in reverse way like the result which you have now, how many events and circumstances happened which led you there where you are now? At least approximate possibility of that to happen.  Where you will be tomorrow? In year? In ten years?.

TL;dr  gonna be happy to hear you opinions about life events. Freedom of choice is it illusion and all things are already predetermined or you will be the one how way you think. Universal flow? God?."

With the growing conflict between the US and Iran, I feel that this needs to be understood. It feels surreal that we have a threat of war at this point in time. I feel that it is impossible that those in charge of either nation or army, can possibly understand the finality of death."

philosophy,"There are a few different theories of consciousness and they deal with qualitative experiences in different ways. Integrate Information Theory would peg conscious experience to be the causal geometry of an information system, making it a sort of first class ontologically object within the world. By contrast, most simulationist theories would peg ""qualitative experiences"" to be more of a seeming, an illusion caused by the way information is processed on the brain.

Then of course there are theories like panpsychism that literally treat consciousness like a first class **physical** object. I don't have much of an opinion on that.

stocks,"So, to my knowledge short interest is just the percentage of shares outstanding in which are being shorted. 

Doesn‚Äôt this mean that stocks with a high short interest have a higher upwards potential since there‚Äôs the possibility of a short squeeze?

For example a stock with 0% short interest simply moves up and down based on buying and selling, but short interest seems to essentially be the equivalent of selling too. 

So if you purchase a stock with 50% short interest (just an example) and it goes up say 5%, and the shorters get scared and exit their positions, doesn‚Äôt that mean it would go up even more (if that‚Äôs what a short squeeze is anyway)?

I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if it may be better to look at companies with good fundamentals and high short interest as it is, since I‚Äôm thinking that might mean there‚Äôs even more room to go up. I could be completely wrong, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking! Thanks."

Overall, quite happy with this scalp. To be honest, I got incredibly lucky in timing it right around the time the Trump news came out today. I originally entered in with +4 /ES, when the market over reacted initially around [here](https://i.imgur.com/wN4gwo0.png) (it was impossible to get filled at my initial order so I left it open) then added +2 when it dropped a bit after the initial green moment. I sat around with a few alerts set up to keep me alert on the position. I set a trailing stop once it broke past \~2850 and let it ride from there. I ended up getting kicked from my position around 2856.5 for a grand total of $6000. All in around an hour and a half or so.

Can it do it again?](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fkenkam%2F2019%2F05%2F15%2Famd-ready-to-run-again-as-zombieload-attacks-intel%2F&amp;text=AMD%20ran%20up%2069%25%20last%20year.%20Can%20it%20do%20it%20again%3F) Tony Mitchell, who has outperformed all U.S. equity mutual funds for the last 10 and 15 years, first told us to buy AMD in January 2018 and made it his top pick for 2019. History may be repeating itself as Intel CPUs have recently been revealed to be vulnerable to a new attack called Zombieload, that does not appear to affect AMD CPUs.

**Why AMD Ran Up 69% Last Year**

In January 2018, When Intel revealed announced their CPUs were vulnerable to attacks called Spectre and Meltdown, they released software patches to address the problem. However, early reports surfaced that the patches reduced Intel's CPU performance between 5% and 25%. Intel said that the performance degradation was work-load dependent and since most people don't fully utilize their CPU they would not notice it.

While true about most users, there are customers who do fully utilize their CPUs -- corporate datacenters. For these customers, installing a patch that reduces CPU performance by 25% is like a 25% price increase because they now have to buy 5 CPUs to do the same work that 4 used to do.

This did not immediately benefit AMD because Intel said that Spectre and Meltdown were industry-wide problems meaning that AMD CPUs were equally affected. This turned out to be only partially true.

AMD CPUs are significantly less vulnerable to Spectre and Meltdown because AMD CPUs do not use the feature that these attacks exploit. While not immune from these attacks, AMD's software patches do not exact the same performance penalty as Intel's. The advantage AMD gained in the datacenter market is largely why the stock ran up 69% in 2018.

**It's Happening Again**

The researchers who discovered Spectre and Meltdown have discovered a new vulnerability they call Zombieload which affects all Intel CPUs since 2011. Importantly, they say AMD CPUs do not appear to be affected.

Apple just announced that enabling the software patches to fully mitigate Zombieload, which they call Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS), caused as much as a 40% performance reduction in their testing. I want to see what kind of performance degradation occurs on Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux, but this is looking good for AMD.

**My Take**: While Intel will no doubt have a way to spin this news that is more favorable to them, I'd rather depend on Tony Mitchell's views when it comes to the investment implications.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Tony first bought AMD in October 2014 at $3.45. He recommended AMD in January 2018 and made it his [top pick for 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/01/21/amd-is-top-internet-fund-managers-top-pick-for-2019) when it was at $19. At today‚Äôs price of $27, he has already made a lot of money on his original investment and he sees a lot more upside in 2019.

Tony's Internet Fund has an 18+ year track record that extends through 2 market crashes, numerous corrections, and sector rotations. Over that period, Tony averaged 17.50% a year which compares well to the S&amp;P 500's 5.83% return for the same period. He is up 31% year-to-date vs. 18% for the S&amp;P 500.

stocks,"I am very new to investing and just started this December. I invested in Disney at the time because I saw potential in Disney+, upcoming movies and revenues from parks. I bought the share at $108 and didn't have a selling price in mind for it when I bought it and was thinking long term.

After following this subreddit over the past few months, one of the strategies that I have come across is that people sell stocks when they reach a certain peak and then wait for it to fall down to buy it again. I think this is a good strategy.

At this point, I am not sure what I want to do with Disney. Do I sell it now when it hits $140 (~30% profit) and then wait for it to fall down or just hold it hoping for it to keep climbing up.

I haven't been in the market long enough to understand  the strategy and the trends. I would very much appreciate perspectives."

WKHS is in the middle of a Death Spiral Financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of [Karl-Heinz Kipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa [department store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store) chain.

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it?

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) S-3 12/26/18

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g)

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 5 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal don't you think?

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [‚Äúbust out‚Äù ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon).

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [Surefly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential.

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by.

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF)

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly..

[https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4](https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4)

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing????!!! This is insanity! He is supposed to be the president of the United States, supposedly the greatest military strength in world history, the Commander-In-Chief, and he is pumping this POS.....

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is explicitly for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, and in 2018 sales were $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though. If you do the math, 2018 expenses were 3000% of net sales!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!!

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy. [Also, the founder recently left, someone who had been with the company for almost a decade!](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/05/1711059/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Promotes-President-and-Chief-Operating-Officer-Duane-Hughes-to-Chief-Executive-Officer.html)

I must excuse myself for all the expletives and caps, and I know it may seem like I'm engaging in hyperbole, but look at this! This is a disgrace. An insult to not just our intelligence, but to our capital markets. The supposed Commander-In-Chief of the Free World pumping penny stocks in the middle of death spiral financing, facing bankruptcy, with almost 20 million registered warrants owned by de facto royalty.....All you can do is just take a deep breath and shake your head in stunned exasperation at this point. I don't recommend buying this, that's for sure, not now anyways. You let me down with this one Trump. I love the guy, but this is just not acceptable by any measure"
stocks,Why do stocks not split as much as they used to?
stocks,"I want to diversify towards TECH stocks and maybe BANKS. I'm currently in my 20s and only invested into WEEDSTOCKS, so I am pro-risk, but since I want to diversify towards TECH/BANK, which is not diversifying that much but it's adding into my portfolio. I am wondering if I should pick out my stocks or just buy into ETFs that involved TECH and BANK ? I feel I know the answer for myself but maybe would like second opinions since I am not the most experienced.

I am loving MSFT and DIS so far. Long term they'll be great. As for Amazon, I have never used their services, never used SHOP, BABA, JD, not much knowledge on the e-commerce side of business. Therefore, I would like less exposure on that side (some but less than MSFT/DIS) But if I had play around money probably hit some SHOP/JD. As far as banks, I'm with BMO, family with TD so some BMO/TD, loving BMO/TD. -- from Canada.

With the weed market down, was thinking of average down my positions (LHS, APHA, IAN, TRST, MPXI) but thought instead of switching sectors in my portfolio. So adding: MSFT, DIS, BMO, TD and some JD, SHOP.

Therefore, knowing which stocks I like, would I be better off investing directly into them or just take ETFs that involves them all? I've never invested into ETFs. (with Questrade)"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

If there comes a recession, isnt the only reason gold increase in price is because less is being digged up? And thereby increasing the price of gold? (simple supply and demand?)  
And wouldnt goldmines have to lay down people because of the lesser demand of gold? And thereby goldmine stocks would drop?"

And please do not start explaining to me about automation until we see any proof that they are anywhere near it. I want to understand why they should be valued at anything different than a taxi company as of right now.

I buy stocks at let's say 0.50 and as soon as the stock hits .51 or higher I sell it right away .
I usually buy same penny dtock for worth $4000 or 5000 a d depending on the increase i make quick 40 or 50 bucks .
Generally theses stock patterns repeat throughout the day.  Fluctuating  between 0.50 and. 0.51 or so.

Is buying penny stocks worth $4000 to make 40 or 50 bucks per stock increase a good idea .?

I'm trying to buy that back once (if) the price drops below mid-70s.

Any thoughts on whether this is likely to continue to go up in the short term?  Long term?  What's likely to happen when they release their first earnings on June 6?  I'd assume the price would go up if net income is over 1/4 the yearly net in their S-1, but expectations may be so high that that's not the case."

# **Fed speakers could steal focus from trade war in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/fed-speakers-could-steal-focus-from-trade-war-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; A flurry of Fed speakers and any new trade developments could shake up what normally might be a slow week of trading ahead of the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.
*****
&gt; Stocks ended the past week with losses, as trade-related headlines caused big swings in the market. The Dow ended the week with a 0.7% loss to 25,764 in its fourth negative week. The S&amp;P 500 fell for a second week, losing 0.8% to 2,859. The Nasdaq lost even more, 1.2% for the week, after U.S. action against China‚Äôs Huawei depressed U.S. tech names that do business in China.
*****
&gt; Friday ended with losses in the final hour, after CNBC‚Äôs Kayla Tausche reported that talks between the U.S. and China appear to have stalled, and there have been no discussions on scheduling a new round.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWith the trade stuff, this is brass knuckles time. When you institute tariffs...when you go to 25% like we just did, all of a sudden there‚Äôs no room for error,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúThe stakes are so much greater at 25%, and if we did the other $300 billion dollars, then we start damaging the consumer and you can guarantee a global recession.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The U.S. raised tariffs last week from 10% to 25% on $200 billion in goods, and China responded by raising tariffs on $60 billion in goods.
*****
&gt; Boockvar, like others, had been looking for a trade deal earlier in the month, but there has been no sign of positive movements, and the crackdown on Huawei raised concerns about China retaliating against U.S. companies.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúChina is not bending and with Trump taunting them, they‚Äôre pissed. It still remains the case that everyone wants a deal , It‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest. It‚Äôs tough to negotiate when you get hit in the head with a baseball bat,‚Äù said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks Monday night at the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs annual conference on Amelia Island, Fla. and there are about a dozen Fed speakers appearing at various conferences and events. There are also minutes Wednesday afternoon from the last Fed meeting, where Powell re-emphasized that the Fed was on hold and it did not see low inflation as a big enough reason to cut rates.
*****
&gt; The market this week began pricing in more than one Fed rate cut for this year, as traders in fed funds futures reacted to some weaker economic data.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhatever message the Fed feels like it needs to get across, they‚Äôll use the minutes to do it. I think they‚Äôre really going to pound the table that they‚Äôre doing nothing for now. They don‚Äôt want to give in to what the market is pricing in, and that‚Äôs a rate cut,‚Äù said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Both retail sales and industrial production were weaker than expected in the past week. The coming week is light on data though there are PMI manufacturing data Thursday and durable goods data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Existing home sales Tuesday and new home sales on Thursday could also be an important read on the spring housing market.
*****
&gt; There are a few final earnings reports for the quarter, including major retailers like Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and Lowe‚Äôs.

# Stocks Stand Tall Against Headwinds

&gt; Renewed trade tensions have led to this latest bout of volatility. The recent drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index felt worse because of how quickly it happened‚Äîfrom new highs to down nearly 5% in less than two weeks. Keep in mind stocks have come pretty far pretty fast, beginning with the strong rally at the first of the year that put the S&amp;P 500 back at record highs.

&gt; Swift rallies like this have also tended to lead to drawdowns as stocks typically have lost some steam midyear‚Äîhence sparking the well-known market adage ‚ÄúSell in May.‚Äù The stock market was probably due for some volatility. The S&amp;P 500 has averaged more than three pullbacks of 5% or more each year since 1990, and we‚Äôre still waiting for our first one this year. ‚ÄúEven though volatility has picked up, and may be with us for a while as risk of a bigger trade war lingers, a pullback or two in the coming months would be totally normal, even with fundamentals still in solid shape,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace, it‚Äôs steadily creating jobs, wages are broadly rising, and some benefits of tax reform and other fiscal spending are still flowing through. We expect a pickup in business investment to help extend this economic cycle. Key risks beyond a full-blown trade war include lackluster growth in Europe, a messy U.K. divorce from the Europe Union, and rising geopolitical risk in the Mideast.

&gt; According to the U.S. Treasury, China has cut its holding of U.S. Treasury securities to a 22-month low, potentially in retaliation as the trade dispute lingers. ‚ÄúWhat isn‚Äôt discussed as much, though, is that global demand remains strong, with foreign ownership of U.S. debt hitting a record high last month,‚Äù added Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, China has been decreasing how much U.S. debt it holds, while Japan has silently increased its holdings for five consecutive months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/China-Is-Selling-But-Japan-Is-Buying.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we remain hopeful that the United States and China will reach some kind of a trade agreement‚Äîor at least a trade truce‚Äîin the next few months. President Trump cares about the stock market and the economy, and considers both part of his path to re-election. Both sides have a lot to lose from further escalation. And the two sides already came very close to a deal, which suggests the remaining sticking points can be worked out.

# Pullbacks Happen

&gt; As we noted yesterday, the recent bout of volatility has caught many investors off guard. However, we‚Äôve been saying since late March that some type of normal correction could happen, and we‚Äôve taken a more cautious stance.

&gt; This was one of the best starts to a year ever for equities, which historically has led to modest returns the next six months, with an above average chance of a large correction.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Big-Starts-to-a-Year-Can-Produce-Weak-Results-Going-Forward.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell nearly 5% before bouncing back yesterday. Here‚Äôs the catch: 5% pullbacks are actually perfectly normal parts of investing. ‚ÄúAfter a 25% bounce since the lows of December and a near 5% decline, it might feel scary and uncomfortable to investors, but it is important to remember that pullbacks are part of investing,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúTrees don‚Äôt grow forever, and neither do bull runs. A break is usually needed before the eventual resumption of higher returns.‚Äù

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, there has been an average of more than three separate 5% declines for the S&amp;P 500 per year going back to 1990. Given there hasn‚Äôt been a 5% pullback yet this year, we think the odds are quite strong that we see multiple 5% drops the rest of this year as the economic cycle ages and volatility picks up.

# On Again/Off Again Tariffs &amp; It‚Äôs a Pre-Election Year

&gt; Even though it has only been a handful of weeks since these charts were last updated and presented, they do put the last few weeks of trading into a broader view. As of today‚Äôs close, DJIA is up 9.9% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 13.7% while NASDAQ is still best at 17.9%. Yes, this is down from late-April/early-May highs, but still solid numbers when compared to this point in past pre-election years and especially all years. The recent pullback and the nascent recovery rally could gather further steam and run until early-July (and perhaps challenge old highs again), but from around mid-July until October seasonality becomes a headwind and more backing and filling is likely again.

# Fed &amp; Tariffs Kick Off ‚ÄúSell(ing) in May‚Äù

&gt; Compared to typical May trading over the recent 21-year period, this May has veered off course earlier than usual. On the first trading day of the month, the Fed harshly squashed budding hopes of an interest rate cut and the viewed was confirmed on the second trading day leading to DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ losses on the first and second instead of typical mild average gains. The market did enjoy a brief rally on the third, but it came to a crashing halt as attentions shifted back to trade negations with China. The implementation of 25% tariffs last Friday was initially overlooked, but the realities of the increasing probability of an extended and tumultuous negation process with China (not to mention another flare-up in the Mideast tensions) are hitting the market today. Should the S&amp;P 500 finish the day down more than 1.9%, it will be the second worst day of the year. Only January 3, 2019 was worse, off 2.5%. If mid-May strength fails to materialize, the second half of May could be worse than the first half.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/17/19

&gt; Similar to equity price action, the first half of the week was a bit rough but things finished on much more solid ground for economic data. Small business optimism kicked things off on Monday stronger than both expectations and March‚Äôs reading, coming in at 103.5. Other Monday releases weren‚Äôt as lucky as they broadly came in weaker. Export and import price inflation worsened in April and mortgage delinquencies rose. Fortunately, foreclosures fell 3 basis points down to 0.92%. Empire Manufacturing started Wednesday with a bang coming in at 17.8, more than double estimates of 8.0. But it wasn‚Äôt all good as retail figures for the month of April were weaker across the board and Industrial and Manufacturing Production fell 0.5% alongside weaker Capacity Utilization. Things turned much more positive on Thursday, though, as every release beat expectations. Claims were stronger, the Philly Fed crushed estimates, and Housing Starts and Permits both rose while also beating forecasts. On Friday, Michigan Confidence rose to 102.4 versus expectations of staying at 97.2, ending the week on a very high note.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/051719-Eco.png))**

&gt; Turning to next week, it will be a light data slate with only 14 releases all week. The Chicago Fed releases their National Activity Index Monday morning; the only release that day. Similarly, Existing Home Sales is the sole release Tuesday. Meeting Minutes for the May 1st FOMC meeting will be out Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the standard weekly releases, we will get preliminary Markit PMIs, New Home Sales, and the Kansas City Fed‚Äôs Manufacturing Activity Index on Thursday. Preliminary Durable goods for April rounds things off on Friday with weaker data anticipated.

I have made a huge mistake against my gut and my stock investing rules and went ahead and invested a day before the earnings release (cuz I thought they‚Äôre going to beat the earnings) and now my position is down 18%-. My thoughts now that I have to buy more of the stock to average out the cost, however, I am not totally sure of the business fundamentals they seem to have competition everywhere they go;

1. Search engine is primarily the main business: the Goliath, Google, is planning to renter to Chinese market soon. 

2. Cloud computing: all of the big Chinese companies are competing in the segment such as Alibaba. 

3. AI; such as the Apollo project, I don‚Äôt see how they can monetise this as they have worldwide competition from .....

I know I am missing opportunities, and using a phone without any scanners or more time to properly research makes it difficult to progress my understanding on trends and patterns along with good moving stock.

So my question is, what is some way I could potentially aid myself in finding potential trades given my circumstances, whether it be for learning or financial gain or both? Are there trades I can watch more often than others that can provide guidence? Anything can help.

As some of you may remember, the President announced that Workhorse was in talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown complex. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that this is, in my opinion(opinion), impossible, and I‚Äôll show you why.

WKHS is in the middle of a Death Spiral Financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of [Karl-Heinz Kipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa [department store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store) chain. [His sisters wedding was attended by the likes of Prince Harry, Prince William, and numerous other prominent royals.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9904867/Duke-and-Duchess-celebrate-friends-wedding-in-Swiss-Alps.html) 

[https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A](https://imgur.com/MhCJJ1A)

At first, it wasn‚Äôt readily apparent who Till Bechtolsheimer was. When he participated in the GP of Monaco racing event, there was an article written about him that pretended he was [some mystery man.](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/03/16/cjwrs-renaissance-man-till-bechtolsheimer-reflects-on-first-ctsc-year/) 

[https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C](https://imgur.com/2FJKH5C)

   
 

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find out who he was because in 2014, his girlfriend (I‚Äôm guessing ex girlfriend now) was party to an altercation where it is claimed she[ smashed a beer bottle over the back of a mans head](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509010704/https:/www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-defend-friend-of-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-accused-of-beer-bottle-attack-in-club-9138649.html) for daring to bump into her royal boyfriend at a nightclub.

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it? 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j](https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j) 3/27/19, S-3 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) S-3 12/26/18 

   
 

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶ 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g) 

   
 

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 4 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal don't you think? 

   
 

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [‚Äúbust out‚Äù ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon). 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/U49I51k](https://imgur.com/U49I51k) 

   
 

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [Surefly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential. 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/LFngngO](https://imgur.com/LFngngO)

   
 

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by. 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF)

   
 

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly.. 

   
 

[https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4](https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4)

   
 

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing????!!! This is insanity! He is supposed to be the president of the United States, supposedly the greatest military strength in world history, the Commander-In-Chief, and he is pumping this POS.....

   
 

[https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX](https://imgur.com/9JMFGMX)

   
 

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is explicitly for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

[https://imgur.com/IokM41c](https://imgur.com/IokM41c) 10k

   
 

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, and in 2018 sales were $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though. If you do the math, 2018 expenses were 3000% of net sales!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!! 

   
 

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy.

stocks,I work for Amazon and get free company stock. By August I'll have 3 stocks I can choose to sell or keep. Im wondering what the tax rate will be if I choose to sell and if I should sell all of them or only 1. This is the only stock I own so I don't have any knowledge of investing at all. I'm in the 12% tax bracket if that helps answer my question.
stocks,"Hello everyone! 

So I am not the most knowledgeable regarding stocks, so I figured that maybe someone would be able to give me some advice.

I stumbled across a few old stock certificates from ~2005, and they are they old Pixar certificates with the Pixar characters and the infamous Steve Jobs signature back when he was chairman. I have 2 certificates each for 2 shares. 

I did a bit of research and it seems like the certificates themselves are selling pretty well online, but I have no clue how to go about this process or if that is the best move to make. 

Is it better to just cash out the stocks? If so, what is the best way to do so? I have never done anything like that before. If I decide to just sell the certificate, is there a specific way I should go about that besides just listing it on eBay? 

Thank you SO much i‚Äôm advance and I apologize for my lack of knowledge in this area."

stocks,"VFF is a license producer of cannabis in Canada.  Current market cap is \~650m.  There peers are CGC, APHA, TLRY, etc.  The exception is that they are one of the rare profitable companies in this sector.  They've been a grower of produce (tomatoes, cucumber, etc.) for the last 30yrs operating on razor thin margins and have already established relationships with big box retailers like walmart, wholefoods, krogers, etc.  With the recent nationwide legalization of cannabis in Canada and Hemp in the US, they've pivoted.  They own a 5msqft greenhouse in Canada and is in a Joint Venture (50% )with Emerald Health Therapeutics under a company called Pure Sun Farms (psf).  They're currently cultivating 1.1M sqft (D3) this year and will be converting another 1.1M sqft (D2) to be completed Q2 next year (yet another 2.7m sqft is waiting in the wings -- D1).   In the states, they have a JV (65%) with Natures Crisp based in GA and are currently cultivating 800acres of Hemp. They have access to another 5000acres as part of this agreement. Planting is expected to be completed by Mid June and a rolling harvest will commence about 1-2mo later.

There are 2 major catalysts for this week.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Last Friday, They were just granted a processing license by Health Care Canada.  This enables them to sell their cannabis directly to the provinces.  Up until now, they've been strictly wholesale.

2) Texas is on the verge (this week) to legalizing Hemp.  VFF owns a 5.7m sqft greenhouse in Hemp and will move to quickly convert their operations to the much more lucrative business of Hemp and CBD.

Oppenheimer gives Outlooks Therapeutics $12.00 price target(...wtf)

[https://imgur.com/Vt4DyJB](https://imgur.com/Vt4DyJB)

Oppenheimer commits to buying 26 400 000 shares and warrants from Outlook.

[https://imgur.com/fvfjnEU](https://imgur.com/fvfjnEU) 424b4 April.10th.

[https://imgur.com/zon2Qwh](https://imgur.com/zon2Qwh) Chart. Price fell to under $1.00 after this offering. The price per share in the offering was $2.75. Before this recent uptick on May.15, the price was still under $1.00. Underwritten in ""bought deal"".

[https://imgur.com/J8FunXu](https://imgur.com/J8FunXu) Outlook receives 26 million

You can see here [https://imgur.com/yCXHV0f](https://imgur.com/yCXHV0f) that the deal closed with Outlook receiving $26.2 million from the underwriters on April.12.

Are we really to trust Oppenheimer? They were down more then 50% at the time of that buy rating. If it moved from $1.00 to $12.00, that would be a 1200% increase! Charlie Munger is famous for saying, ‚Äúshow me the incentive, and I‚Äôll show you the outcome‚Äù, and with the warrants exercisable at $2.90, this could make a good short term trade, but $12.00? Absolutely not!! Think about it, lets say the price did in fact go to $12.00, Oppenheimer would theoretically be making $160 160 000! They would obviously exercise the warrants well before then because their job is to underwrite the offering, not invest, but it still puts into perspective how ridiculous this buy rating is. Just look at their most recent quarterly report. They only had $100 000 in cash!!???!! WTF!!! How many more offerings will they do between the run up to $12?!!

[https://imgur.com/a/JGL8U1v](https://imgur.com/a/JGL8U1v)

stocks,"Just wanted to share some opinions on HUYA, which is my favourite pick (together with IQ) when it comes to China Stocks. 

Disclaimer: I currently hold a position in HUYA


**HUYA**

HUYA is currently in a rising market, and their numbers show. The eSport/Gaming market is currently in its infant stage and I would label it as a 'hyper market'. Growth like this is crazy and revenues in this industry are likely to double in just a few years from now.

HUYA is also (in my opinion) a realistic company in terms of goals. They know they can't take on Twitch in the US or Europe right now, and they won't until they perfect their product. In a recent [interview with the CEO](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/05/20/nyse-listed-huya-is-working-on-its-strategy-in-asia-latam-and-africa-before-entering-the-us-says-ceo.html) he states that they will focus on Asia, LATAM, and Africa.

I live in Asia and I am from a European background and I know that HUYA will have a much better cultural connection to the Asian people than ever Twitch will. Culture is so important here and you might be wondering how that would influence a platform like this but there are so many reasons, and I suspect that HUYA can become the stronger platform in this region in the coming years.

- China Regulations on Gaming

These regulations will hurt the smaller developers more than the big ones, and most eSports games are run by big companies. Devs will need licenses to release new games, this will hinder a ton of games from releasing but it doesn't affect existing games, and the larger companies will probably not experience much difficulty here as the licensing will be done in advance to avoid delays. This also only affects China, which is currently a big portion of their userbase but they are already expanding in other regions, and the amount of gaming that takes place in Asia is unfathomable. Almost every person I see here on the subway is playing some form of game, guys mostly play competitive games like some kind of mobile league of legends, while females tend to play puzzlers/match-3 games.


- Trump &amp; trade war

I don't see any relationship between HUYA and the trade war. Their core business should be totally uneffected by this, yet it is the main reason it's dropping.


- Debt

HUYA has no long term debt but they did recently raise money


- 5G

The development of 5G could have a huge impact on them. More people will be able to stream on the go and it will open a bunch of new possibilities for HUYA.



That's all, just wanted to share my thoughts."
stocks,"Full disclosure: I own a short position.

It makes no difference to me if Uber succeeds or fails, I‚Äôm not a stakeholder of the company. I‚Äôve never shorted a stock due to high risks but Uber almost seems too perfect not to do so. Below are my reasons for shorting Uber, please let me know if I‚Äôm missing anything.

1) Declining revenue growth rate
Revenue growth fell from 106% in 2017 to 42% in 2018. Q4 revenue was a mere 2% higher than Q3. 

2) Unprofitability in ride-hailing
Take rate declines from 22% in Q1 to 18% in Q4 (2018) Drivers are already going on strike, increasing take rate doesn‚Äôt seem like an option.  They could increase prices but customers will find alternatives and hence they lose market share. 

3) UberEats isn‚Äôt the top food delivery business by market share in the US, Doordash is. Doordash is also growing at a quicker rate. Amazon recently invested half a billion in Deliveroo, which is a big player in the UK and the EU.

4) No economic moat
What‚Äôs fundamentally wrong about all of Uber‚Äôs businesses is that anyone can do them given enough funding. Market share is bought with infinite expenditure like promotions, subsidies, discounts and marketing. These fake gains last only as long as cash is being burnt funding these expenditures. 

5) Not the leader in autonomous vehicles 
Toyota among other companies have funded Uber‚Äôs self driving unit. Toyota, a company that hasn‚Äôt produced a full electric vehicle. In no particular order, companies like Waymo (partnered with Lyft), GM and Tesla are the leaders in AV tech. These companies have the power to produce fleets of EVs and Tesla EVs already have the hardware required for OTA FSD software upgrades when Tesla does achieve FSD. Where are Uber‚Äôs factories? They are 3-5 years behind in my opinion.

6) Weak bull case 
I‚Äôve been hearing Bulls use the words ‚Äònetwork effect‚Äô over and over again, citing Uber‚Äôs huge global platform. The reality is 70% of on-demand Drivers in the US drive for both Lyft and Uber. I‚Äôll bet a much higher percentage of customers use both Lyft and Uber, not doing so would be outright financially irresponsible. It doesn‚Äôt even take 20 seconds to check which are offering better discounts for the day. If the network effect is so strong, Uber wouldn‚Äôt have sold it‚Äôs market share to Grab in SEA, Yandex in Russia and Didi in China. There is no customer loyalty when it comes to rideshare apps. Bulls tend to shift focus to Uber‚Äôs more potentially profitable businesses like Eats and Freight as though Uber‚Äôs valuation isn‚Äôt entirely based off the fact that it has the biggest rideshare platform. However successful Eats and Freight might be in the future, Uber stock will be due for a big correction if rideshare proofs to never be profitable. 

7) Business model attracts lawsuits
Disrupting the highly regulated cab industry has brought Uber tons of lawsuits. Uber is facing a class action lawsuit in Australia. It‚Äôs lack of background checks in hiring drivers and attitude of taking no responsibility for customer well-being is causing itself to be sued left, right and center.

8) Losses 
No company has ever lost so much money and yet be further away from profitability like Uber. The company openly admits to the possibility of never being profitable. 4.5b operating loss in 2017, 3b in 2018. When asked if 2019 will mark a record year of losses for Uber, CEO Dara replied ‚ÄúThat is the intent‚Äù. Not to be taken out of context, he certainly means record losses incurred trying to gain the most market share but it also means that if Uber does not show better than expected revenue gains, its stock is finished.

For a company with no clear path to profitability, has a long-term debt of $8b, slowing revenue growth, how is the stock trading at 7x revenue? I think we would really see a huge correction if Uber reports a decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. If you‚Äôre bullish on rideshare, choose Lyft (which I don‚Äôt have a position in), Lyft has no long term debt and they are partnered with Waymo for AVs. Why would anyone touch Uber stock with a 100ft pole?! Am willing to listen to any bull cases or anything I might have missed out."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

After 9 years of operations they are losing 2 billion per year, and now they want to beg for money in the stock market so they can eventually achieve their grand vision for the future of working

[https://imgur.com/gallery/lJNiVfc](https://imgur.com/gallery/lJNiVfc)

Wework is in the business of coworking office space. According to deskmag.com, coworking is described like this:

**‚ÄúWhat makes coworking special? An important precondition of coworking is the exceptional situation of coworkers. They work mostly in self-determined situations: the majority are self-employed freelancers, or entrepreneurs with their employees, as well as an increasing number of employees of large companies‚Äù.**

It sounds great, but‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs been 9 years now. To lose 2 billion dollars in 1 year would be a huge blow to any company. Even Google or Amazon would feel a loss like that. Whats worse is that the concept of coworking hasn‚Äôt even been proven or widely accepted yet. We don‚Äôt know yet if it is more efficient (its not, common sense goes a long way sometimes). Anybody who has worked by themselves knows very few people can do it efficiently, and this is why the standard template of executive/manager/worker will never go away. Wework is still a unique idea that is worth trying out, but building 41 billion dollars of unique office space based upon this theory is insanity. It‚Äôs almost reminiscent of China‚Äôs highly inefficient BRI, where cities are built inland far from any water source and [Sri Lanken seaports go virtually unused ](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/inside-chinas-us1-billion-port-in-sri-lanka-where-ships-dont-want-to-stop). It‚Äôs all about that long term though right.

Regardless of how inefficient the Chinese are sometimes, they make up for it with their 996 work schedule, and you could only imagine the reaction you‚Äôd get if you showed them some of Wework‚Äôs office spaces. How is our generation supposed to compete when this is what our idea of work is. Seriously? If this is the case, we are fucked! Better start learning Mandarin sooner rather then later.

The problem with expanding a business before you even know it will work is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..ehm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..what if your plan, that incredible all seeing vision of the future was wrong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Or even better, what if ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶things like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶change.

Nobody knows the future, but history is replete with people that thought they did, and the result was always the same. Just because the concept seems like it will work, doesn‚Äôt mean it will, and that is why it is usually not smart to go all in at first. Like the saying goes, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, and don‚Äôt go all in at first, or start small then work your way up, but history will always repeat itself, and the reason why is because human psychology will always stay the same. Some of the greatest minds the world has ever seen have made some of histories greatest mistakes. They will make excuses, or look the other way, or in Weworks case, pretend some expenses don‚Äôt actually exist by inventing completely novel and unheard of internal accounting standards.

We have all heard of EBITDA, and some of us have also heard of Adjusted-EBITDA, but have you ever heard of ‚ÄúCommunity-Adjusted-EBITDA‚Äù? Nobody has. Why? Because WeWork made it up! Not only are they innovating the world of working, but also accounting!! Genius! When you have no cash, just pretend you do and everything will be okay!

I guess General and Administrative Expense, a fundamental part of any normal business, just doesn‚Äôt count‚Ä¶I mean counting that would conflict with their core community vision right? Take a look at this video.

[https://www.bitchute.com/video/d2OcUen5pFTp/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/d2OcUen5pFTp/)

A normal business would cut growth to generate cash, or maybe even sell some assets, but because Wework is so devoted to their grand vision, and so sure it will work, doing this would be counter productive in their eyes. I mean, I guess you can understand their logic from that angle. If you know it is going to work, just find the money somewhere else, then wait for this inevitable growth to flatten out those wrinkles‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..eventually‚Ä¶..someday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it will work. It‚Äôs only 41 billion. Think of the market they are tapping. Everybody works, so the possibilities are almost limitless!

One of Tesla's biggest bulls just turned around and trashed the company on a private call with Wall Street.

In a private call with clients on Wednesday, the Morgan Stanley analyst and Tesla perma-bull Adam Jonas painted a bleak picture for the company he's been touting for so long.

Jonas sees Tesla floundering under its debt load now that it's no longer a growth story.

He also sees the company's next moves ‚Äî the new Model Y, the refresh of the Models S and X ‚Äî as insufficient to bring it back to good.""

Maybe retail consumers aren't ready to get into the segment the way Elon thought they were,"" he mused."

stocks,"1. Historically diamonds have been traded on inclosed B2B exchange platforms. Marketplace is a space open for any kind of audience and any kind of business relations including P2P and B2C.   
 2. A marketplace is able to gather in one place individual diamond holders, buyers, diamond cutters, jewelers, as well as those involved in the gemstone business. Individual holder will be able to sell diamonds not only to jeweler, but to any interested person across the whole world.  
3. Marketplace can be an excellent option not only for those who want to buy a valuable gift for beloved one at a reasonable price, but also for those who want to open their own online jewelry store. There is no need to make a website, promote it, rent an office or a warehouse. DOM has everything ready. Marketplace opportunities are enough to organize and coordinate small and medium businesses.  
 4. Until now market monopolists evaluate diamonds themselves, trying to get the maximum profit from each client. Markups of jewellery stores turn diamonds into an unreasonably expensive item. Having bought a diamond in such a store, it won't be possible to sell it back for the same amount. The marketplace will gather diamonds from individual owners and sellers who will compete with each other, offering buyers the most attractive prices.  
5. When you buy a diamond in jewelry store or from speculator, the data on the deal is never entered into any database, which can be used in case you want to sell the stone. A modern marketplace, like Diamond Open Market, will store data on every deal in the blockchain where this information can be checked and verified at any time.  
All together this will create new opportunities for all the diamond market participants."

Anyways, I am trying to get to about an 80% BTC 20% XRP split because going forward I feel like Bitcoin and Ripple are the only true contenders. I think we will see $20k this summer for a couple of reasons. Primarily I think now that MACD has crossed over and the bull run is truly on, mainstream media will push to all the copycat investors that wished they were in for round one. I would say at around $10k there will be some serious attention and hype pushing crypto volume to all time highs. Additionally, with tariffs and trade wars and government collapse in nations like Venezuela, I believe that crypto is more appealing now than ever before. The push for decentralization and controlling your own assets is starting to really make sense to a lot of people. Lastly, with the introduction of BAKKT to the market as well as growing acceptance of the crypto field among many of the worlds leading nations; I believe this only further solidifies the establishment of Bitcoin in the market and helps stabilize crypto as a whole from volatile swings. All right lets hear it...debate me down below.

A few times people have mentioned CLM being rather reliable but I'm not really seeing that. Am I missing something that others know? From what I can tell is that over the last few years it's been on a downward slope. Or do they mean it's reliable for dividends? Because the dividend amount has also dropped over the years.

Anyone mind clearing this up for me, as I don't want to buy a stock that is going to end up hurting my portfolio. Much appreciated!"

4. Kind of a vague question but how easy is it to make some money?"
stocks," Long story short, the company is laying off our center in July due to money issues. The stock been on a steady decline for about three years. It's a ISP. Currently the stock is under $2 and about a year ago they did a reverse 15 to 1 stock split, I believe to keep some of the investors calm... (I think that was what they called it.) With a couple years I expect one of two things to happen to the company: 1) They get bought out by a competitor. OR 2) Bankruptcy. I think option one will happen due to use having a fairly large footprint with some decent infrastructure in some states. I do have money stashed away so hoping to make some money off the dying company if possible.

What I'm curious about is hypothetically, if ATT or Verizon bought the company in a few years is it likely that the stock will go up? For example, if Verizon bought the company would the stock price be the same as Verizons at that point? 2) If that does happen will the reverse stock split still be in play? ie; If I but one of our stock @ $2 and then Verizon buys it and they're at $50, will that turn into $750? ($50\*15)?

Apologies, if it doesn't make exact sense as I don't have to much experience in this field and just trying to see if it's possible to make a buck. Thanks in advance."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Short selling was banned in 2008. Along with it, the convertible-bond market went down. Except, now short selling is stronger than ever.

But why artificially inflate the stock in 2016 to 2017, to then bear raid (artificially deflate) it to potentially $0?

This from an earlier comment:

You force a high stock price on a company that isn't fully running yet and they have to pay back investors who have convertible bonds because they rise with a volatile stock increase.

Then when they pay that large sum, their liquid capital decreases, decreasing profitability and undermining their stock value. Add in terrible, pessimistic attitudes from analysts, and we have the means of bringing down a company through bear raid tactics.

So I think the plan to bring Tesla down via its stock has been planned for a while. Leading me to think there should be a ban again on short selling, to avoid these sinister plots to take happen in the first place.

I invite people to research this and other companies that may have fallen prey to the same market manipulation."

I read the r/stocks wiki and saw their list for brokers but it doesn't include Vanguard, which is why I have the question. I searched but all the vanguard results talk about IRAs and bonds, etc, not like, 10 shares of xx individual stock.

- I had money in Scotttrade, which was a flat $7, but that got bought by TD Ameritrade.
- I have an IRA etc in Vanguard.

I want to buy more stocks; I was going to use one of the apps that can't be named for automod since it looks amazing (No fees I can see? No commission? It's unreal), but I saw that you can also buy individual stocks through Vanguard, and it seems like it'd be nice to keep everything in one place. You have to agree to some T&amp;C before reading more about it, and Vanguard's not mentioned on the beginner ""brokers to buy stocks"" page, so I wanted to just ask.

If you can buy individual stocks with it - why isn't it in the broker list? And... should we?

Thanks!"

# **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market‚Äôs move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,‚Äù said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.
*****
&gt; As for trade, Chandler said it‚Äôs possible that President Donald Trump‚Äôs comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIn some ways, it‚Äôs a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,‚Äù said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. ‚ÄúChina thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.‚Äù
*****
&gt; She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China‚Äôs military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping‚Äôs signature program.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going against the U.S. and we‚Äôve got to be in it for the long haul.‚Äô I don‚Äôt think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don‚Äôt have the same nationalistic pride to say ‚Äòwe have to fight China at all cost,‚Äô‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.
*****
&gt; Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe concerns the markets have right now are that we‚Äôre moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,‚Äù said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% inflation.
*****
&gt; Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.
*****
&gt; Solstein Capital‚Äôs Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.
*****
&gt; She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúPeople are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,‚Äù Terman said.
*****
&gt; Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhat would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market‚Äôs performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative

&gt; Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say ""All in.""

# Fed Members Side With ‚ÄúTransitory‚Äù Inflation

&gt; Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers‚Äô views of inflation.

&gt; Minutes of the Fed‚Äôs most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that ‚Äúmany participants‚Äù considered slowing consumer inflation as ‚Äútransitory,‚Äù and agreed that the Fed‚Äôs current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers‚Äô optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.

&gt; Markets think the grace period for a ‚Äútransitory‚Äù excuse has passed, but data show it‚Äôs too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas‚Äôs ‚Äútrimmed mean‚Äù PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,‚Äù said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúIf consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate.‚Äù

&gt; Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed‚Äôs last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.

&gt; Overall, we don‚Äôt see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it‚Äôs becoming more obvious the Fed doesn‚Äôt have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.

*****

# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.

&gt; Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.

&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIn fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!‚Äù

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns‚Äî10% versus 4.7%‚Äîfollowing four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There‚Äôs always a catch though, and in this case we‚Äôve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-Strong-Start-To-A-Year-Has-Bulls-Smiling.png?ssl=1))**

# Earnings Season Takeaways

&gt; We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&amp;P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4‚Äì5% drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&amp;P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.

&gt; Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.

&gt; ‚ÄúEscalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,‚Äù said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. ‚ÄúWe are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China‚Äôs President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.‚Äù

&gt; Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3‚Äì4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&amp;P 500 fair value target of 3,000‚Äîthough it probably won‚Äôt get there in a straight line.

# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Eight Months‚Äù which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (‚Äì0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).

stocks,"This stock is killing me! I've been averaging down throughout this whole dip and I see it as a relatively cheap stock right now at it's current orice. But I just can't force myself to buy any further right now. I initially got in at around 230 not that long ago. Current price is at 159... I got my average down to 201 but just can't convince myself to put anymore in to get that average down further.

I'm not even looking for advice. I know I'm going to baghold this shitshow until I'm in the green at some point (probably 3 years down the line or some bullshit)...
I just want you guys to tell me that it'll be ok. Averaging down is a genius move. And that buffet would be proud of me"

Or you generally just look at how that market is doing, which choices and innovation the company is bringing, and other information you can find without looking at their financial report?

The stock market is currently doing better than it should largely due to Trump‚Äôs tweet support, in my opinion.

[https://electrek.co/2019/05/27/tesla-mysterious-surprise-announcement-china/](https://electrek.co/2019/05/27/tesla-mysterious-surprise-announcement-china/) 

&amp;#x200B;

There are many speculations what this could be, and I find it interesting that they aren't announcing it through Twitter, [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) or any other mainstream way. To me, this looks like an ""under the radar"" announcement. Could ofc. be hyped up more until Friday.

The China factory is expected to be completed soon, and there are rumors that they are starting to hire for Shanghai Giga. Last time they made a ""surprise announcement"" like this, the stock had some bullish days before it took a drop after the announcement of model Y.

This announcement seems to be China only, and even if you look at the teaser picture, it looks a lot like a vehicle (in my view). To announce the whole factory like this is also a little weird.  Is this a new model, or eventually an own version of model 3 for the Chinese market? Tesla Roadster or more info on model Y?

The pick-up truck seems unlikely since it should be aimed at the US market. Tesla semi I still possible, and we haven't heard too much of it.

The Chinese text on the picture apparently states "" preparing for quick release of accumulated power "". Sounds a like it could be about super-chargers, but the picture doesn't make too much sense in that regard. 

What do you read out of it? is this a desperate attempt to boost the share price, or could this announcement be of real substantial value?"

My name is Leyton and this is a update since i wrote my first topic on reddit, i explained what i want to accomplish during three years, dreams to fulfill and goals i have etc (link: [First Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/af8kez/looking_for_the_dreamers_and_doers_my_story/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) *(Pause, read that topic and come back!)*

It's been five months since i created that post which means i've recieved 5 paychecks, I've invested 68,96% of my salary each month which adds up to a total of 9 500$. When i wrote that post i had a net worth of 16 000$, and now i have 29 112$ which is a major step to financial independence. Haven't touch alchohol for 168 days. Worked 53 hours overtime and in the post i wrote i invest 80% of my salary which i couldn't manage to do for a long time since unexpected expenses came up which i guess is part of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

***What's been though so far?***

It's been extremely though some periods, i've been having the ""fear of missing out"" but then i read about the emotions you feel about missing out on things and it helped me see it from another perspective. This is only the start, i've completed 13,8% of my goal but while not spending, enjoying yourself with materialistic things the time goes by slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

***What am i trying to improve?***

My monthly budget is 500$ and im not spending it very wisely so i am going to improve how i spend my budget cause im usually lazy and don't make my lunch by myself and ending up buying fast food which is really expensive compared to what i could make a dinner for. 

I'd also like to improve my physical health by starting working out cause i am exhausted when i come home from work, this was the first weekend i had a break, before that i worked 6 days a week, four weeks straight and im pretty weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that im just going to make everything better, the phsychological part is the thoughest, it's your mindset you have to master and i made this post ""update"" since i wanted to tell you how the journey has been, to show what i said in actions instead of words.

[https://www.thestreet.com/markets/alibaba-shares-buying-opportunity-14971764](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/alibaba-shares-buying-opportunity-14971764) 

 

The recent decline in Alibaba shares represents a good buying opportunity, wrote Stifel analyst Scott Devitt on Friday, adding the Chinese e-commerce giant to the company's Select List of top investments.¬†

The stock has fallen 20% to $156 a share since the close on May 3, the last trading day before President Trump imposed¬†higher tariffs on Chinese goods just as the market was pricing in optimism a trade deal would be agreed on.¬†

Devitt noted the stock is down 12% since May 15 when Alibaba reported a stellar earnings report in which it beat earnings per share estimates by 33% on the back of explosive revenue growth in cloud computing and strong¬†performance in its core e-commerce business.¬†

""While it is impossible to predict the timing of resolution of certain macro events, we believe the recent pullback has created an opportunity to own shares with a long-term investment horizon,"" Devitt said.¬†

Shares of Alibaba¬†closed down .64% on Friday to¬†$155.00.

Devitt mentioned that Alibaba now trades at a 2021 expected EBITDA multiple of 13, ""and is even cheaper on earnings from the company's core marketplace-based businesses (primarily Tmall and Taobao; 55% of F2019 revenue)."" The current EBITDA multiple ""compares to other large / megacap U.S. or global eCommerce and digital advertising peers trading at an average of 12x on forward- two year EBITDA."" Amazon , for example, trades at a 2021 EBITDA multiple of 13.5.¬†Meanwhile, ""Alibaba expects to maintain an organic growth rate in the mid-30% range in F2020, significantly above the peer group,"" Devitt said.¬†

Devitt also¬†pointed out that Alibaba does very little business with the U.S., and that the long-term trends in the Chinese economy are a tailwind for Alibaba. While many are concerned¬†China's economic growth¬†is decelerating, ""long-term secular trends such as the growing middle class and the economy shifting more towards services are more important to Alibaba's long-term growth trajectory,"" said Devitt.¬†"

Granted, I know 600 days is not long term necessarily. Sure a huge correction or maybe even a recession could take place and then 600 day options really seem like no time at all. I don't know I just figured I would have seen more activity there on these options for these leveraged ETF's

To give you an example of the influence China has over the worlds rare earth elements (REE‚Äôs), the Mountain Pass Mine, once a powerhouse producer of REEs from 1965 to 1985, was completely shut down from 2002 to 2012 because of China, forcing its owner [**Molycorp**](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/molycorp-inc-826190-63907) into eventual bankruptcy in 2015.

According to Roskill, global REE production in 2008 was approximately 119,220 mt, of which only approximately 4,220 mt originated from outside of China, and U.S government officials are very aware of the threat this poses to REE market stability, as expressed by Mike Pompeo on [**May 11, 2017**](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1705/11/ath.02.html)

China also controls about [**85 percent** ](https://breakingdefense.com/2016/03/pentagon-fails-to-act-on-crucial-rare-earth-minerals/)of the REE‚Äôs used in consumer products, an astronomical number.

I still have about 16 months of these benefits remaining. So I wont be needing to withdraw and hoping to be able to hold long term. I was looking around and the the low cost of YMNT looked pretty good with their dividend of 13%. Looking at their 5 year graph. They seem to be pretty stable.

stocks,"Don't get me wrong, I truly believe Mr. Buffett has great intentions when he says things like, ""don't buy off emotion, the stock doesn't know you own it"", ""buy great companies with fantastic leadership"" and countless others euphemisms, as they are full of sound &amp; proven advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Though, the story of how Berkshire Hathaway literally came to be \*\*completely\*\* contradicts that wisdom. For those un-familiar, 

&amp;#x200B;

In 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing a pattern in the price direction of its stock whenever the company closed a mill. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11‚Äã1‚ÅÑ2 per share for the company to buy back Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11‚Äã3‚ÅÑ8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway#cite_note-cnbc.com-14) Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200¬†billion over the subsequent 45 years.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway#cite_note-cnbc.com-14) Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So with that, I ask, do you think Buffett's wisdom is sound knowing ironically the formation of his company today was built on contradicting advice?"
stocks,"Given the way the market is right now with all the volatility I‚Äôm just looking for some feedback on this idea. All feedback is appreciated!


So my idea here is that given the fact that these stocks such as CRON ACB APHA and CGC are not affected by the trade war or really anything besides maybe the occasional politician saying they don‚Äôt want weed legal in the US does anyone else think its a good time to buy, given the fact that the overall market is down and people seem to be pulling their money out of overall volatile stocks like this?

Yes I know at the moment these can be pretty volatile stocks, but the whole market is volatile right now. My considerations here are that these companies are mainly in the growth phase IE why a lot of them have posted negative earnings. In the long run though this puts them in prime positions to dominate any new market, the main one being the US. And in my opinion with the overall market down I think most of these are priced pretty well to buy right now. I‚Äôm not saying dump my whole portfolio into these, but maybe five percent total allocated to buying shares in each one just to possibly offset some red days.

Anyways, just a thought I had running through my head today that I wanted some feedback on. Thanks in advance."

Cosmetic surgery sprang to mind. For a few reasons. In this age of social media we live in I feel people are hyper self-conscious and cosmetic surgery is becoming more normalised. A while back getting your face done would be something you'd only hear of aging Hollywood actresses getting done, now it's totally normal for any local Instagram influencer to get lip fillers regularly. It's also becoming more popular among men, incels etc.

Another point, more and more people are coming out as transgender as the world grows more tolerant of LGBT ways of life. Cosmetic surgery is often highly sought after by these individuals. I only see this demand rising as time goes on.

So, is this even possible as something to invest in? These surgeries are usually done by small practices, so they obviously aren't publicly traded stocks, as far as I can tell anyway. But is there some indirect way I can invest in this industry?  For instance, upon doing a google search I found [this Chinese company that connects users with doctors for cosmetic surgery.](https://technode.com/2019/05/05/so-young-stock-31-debut/)

What led to their downfalls? Were there any warning signs or patterns that we as individual investors could learn from/watch out for?"
stocks,"First of all I want to thank anyone who takes the time to read this.

I‚Äôm 23 years old. No job, no education. When I was 18 I learned about the stock market. I started trading stocks on my phone full time with a fake $100,000 dollars. Getting up at market open and trying to make a profit. 

After about four months I turned that fake $100,000 into roughly $64,000. Obviously I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. I decided to keep studying knowing there are people out there who make a living day and swing trading stocks. 

After another six months of trading and extensive research, I not only regained the $36,000 I had lost, but also around $20,000 more. Not investing but day and swing trading. Soon after, the app and all it‚Äôs data were deleted. When I got a new phone, I started again with another fake $100,000. 

Since then I‚Äôve turned that fake $100,000 account into roughly $250,000. Safe to say that after vigorous trial and error, I now know exactly what I‚Äôm doing, and how to profit consistently and aggressively trading stocks.

Right now I have a trading account open with a measly $2,700 in real money.

My obvious dilemma is that I‚Äôve never had close to $100,000 in cash to set aside for trading. Not even $10,000. There are many regulations when it comes to trading stocks, for instance, the pdt rule, (pattern day trader rule) which was put into effect in 2001, says that no trader can take more than three day trades within five business days unless they maintain a balance of $25,000. 

Until I fund my account with $25,000, I won‚Äôt be able to trade full time. 

If I could take out a loan for $30,000 tomorrow I‚Äôd never have to work for anyone but myself for the rest of my life. 

As far as I know there is nobody who would trust me to pay back that kind of money considering I don‚Äôt have a job or a degree. (Why would they?) The market is open weekdays from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm eastern. 

I‚Äôm a great salesperson but it‚Äôs hard to find a good paying sales job that‚Äôs not a 9-5. 

I‚Äôm also not the greatest at saving and I‚Äôve spent $24,000 on rent the last four years. (Cheapest it gets) I‚Äôve spent those years working multiple jobs I couldn‚Äôt stand. Spending more time clocked in doing what I hate and asleep, than anything else.

Recently I got approved for unemployment benefits just so I have some time to find a job that won‚Äôt make me want to blow my brains out every minute I‚Äôm there. No luck so far.

I know if I want to go to school, the government will approve me for $30,000+ without looking twice, but why the hell would I go into debt and spend that money on school when I know I can turn $30,000 into over $100,000 in less than a year trading stocks?

Proof of my trades: https://imgur.com/a/RKQRP1f

If you look closely, you can see I would have made $45,000 in April alone without any losses.

I know I‚Äôll get $25,000 eventually but I‚Äôve been losing my mind the last four years barley making any progress. When I try to tell talk about it with anyone, most people look at me like I‚Äôm crazy. They‚Äôll tell me it sounds unrealistic. (And it does) I really don‚Äôt know what else to do but it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll have to keep doing what I hate until I save $30,000. (three years minimum) 

Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I Done Goofed...

Tesla had been going back and forth between 300 and 330 for a few months it seemed, always staying within that range. I finally decided to buy in at around 300, thinking I could catch the upswing. 

Unfortunately, Tesla was struck with bad news a few days after my purchase (typical). Naturally, I assumed it was temporary and that they would bounce back as they had done so many times before. But alas, the bad news seemed to roll in more steadily as time went on. Now I‚Äôm stuck with Tesla sitting at \~$185 and left feeling like a total fool for trusting in them. 

At this point, what do I do? Do I hold and ride it out, hoping for any sort of gain above $200, or dump in the fear that they will continue to drop for the foreseeable future?

At the minimum I'd expect a bad quarter or two (after it's resolved).  But is there risk for negative outcomes over years?  Any companies in particular who's long term growth may be impacted?"

Many say that investing in the S&amp;P500 is enough because many of these countries do business overseas, but it is clear that there is one major risk involved in investing in one countries and that is political risk. All sorts of tariffs and restrictions can be slapped on and off. Diversifying across multiple countries mitigates this risk. Furthermore, tariffs on one country do nothing. For example, a tariff on China will just result in that product being exported to eg Japan who will then on-export it to the US. The only way tariffs will work is if it is applied to everyone and if this happens the US economy  will go downhill and the stock market will tank as the country moves towards autotarky."

Started investing 3 years ago with the money I received from family to start off life. I dont know much on managing investments but I have made some good returns.

Furthermore last year I started a separate tech portfolio and now the major holdings are up between 63% - 40% (Service now, Mercadolibre). Should I sell now and lock in profits on my big winners?

The service I use to find these stocks recommends holding 3-5 years but mostly what I read about these companies online is people saying they are bubbles and the price is not backed fundamentally anymore. During last years sell off I was able to sit still because gains were around the 20's. But since the start of this year the tech stocks have shot up like crazy to new highs. 

Should I consider myself lucky and take what I have? My risk tolerance is pretty high considering i'm sitting on good profits."

# **Fed officials and Trump‚Äôs latest trade threat could decide whether June starts with a market swoon  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/fed-officials-and-trumps-latest-trade-threat-could-decide-whether-june-starts-with-a-market-swoon.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials speaking at a policy conference may get a lot more attention than usual in the week ahead after President Donald Trump‚Äôs latest tariff threat against Mexico ramped up expectations for interest rate cuts.
*****
&gt; Markets will also start the month of June, which is often flat for markets, coming off a painful 6.6% monthly loss in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Stocks lost ground in May on worries that the U.S. trade war with China would hurt the global economy and bite into earnings growth. They will begin trading in June with new worries that tariffs on Mexico could hurt the economy and threaten a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
*****
&gt; The coming week has a full calendar of economic data, with the highlight being Friday‚Äôs May employment report. There are also monthly auto sales and Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data due Monday, and international trade data expected Thursday.
*****
&gt; But it is the Fed that should get the most attention, with central bank officials gathering at a much-anticipated conference hosted by the Chicago Fed Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will make the opening remarks at the conference, which is about monetary policy strategy, tools and communications. For months, strategists have been hoping the conference will provide insight into how the Fed intends to address sluggish inflation.
*****
&gt; Interest in the event is even higher after the market and Fed watchers are increasingly convinced the central bank will now cut rates this year, and maybe more than once. The futures market priced in increasing expectations for two rate cuts after Trump‚Äôs threat to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if the Mexican government does not stop immigration into the U.S.
*****
&gt; After the last Fed meeting, Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory, suggesting the Fed would not have to cut rates, but markets still anticipate a rate cut, and inflation continues to run below the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, Barclays chief U.S. economists, said investors hoping to hear Fed officials discuss their thinking on current policy could be disappointed. Gapen said the Fed is also about nine months away from its decision on how it will frame inflation, and the conference will be more about academic views on it.
*****
&gt; Gapen was one of several Wall Street economists Friday who changed his view on the Fed‚Äôs rate policy. He said he now sees the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 75 basis points in two cuts this year, with the Fed starting at 50 basis points in September. The Fed has said does not foresee any rate cuts this year, nor hikes, and has stressed it is on hold.
*****
&gt; Gapen does not expect to hear much from Fed officials at the conference on rates, though investors will be combing through every word looking for policy clues.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the type of setting where anyone would make a monetary policy comment in advance of an FOMC meeting,‚Äù he said. The Fed next meets on June 18 and 19.
*****
&gt; Gapen said he went from expecting no Fed move to two rate cuts because the trade war with China has become more extended than expected; manufacturing and business spending are weakening, and because of Trump‚Äôs threat to put tariffs on Mexico if it doesn‚Äôt control immigrants heading into the U.S. over the southern border.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt does suggest the administration is willing to pursue multiple fronts. It lowers the bar for tariffs on Europe,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Interest rates continued to slide Friday, to multi-year lows. The 2-year yield, which most reflects Fed policy, fell sharply and was at 1.93% in late trading. The 10-year yield, at 2.55% in early May, was at 2.13% Friday afternoon. The S&amp;P 500 was down 2.6% for the week, ending its worst week of the year at 2,752.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief market strategist, said a ‚ÄúMay mauling usually leads to a boom in June.‚Äù Going back to World War II, whenever there was a strong start to the year, the market traditionally fell in May but rose in June. Plus, this year was the third best start through April.
*****
&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said beyond the trade headlines, there are quite a few market catalysts in June.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúJune is going to be very event-driven. It‚Äôs going to be the Fed on June 19. It‚Äôs going to be OPEC on June 25; it‚Äôs going be the G-20 on June 29,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; He added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to stay balanced and diversified because we don‚Äôt know how things are going to come out.‚Äù

# Time For A June Swoon?

&gt; Well, it finally happened. The S&amp;P 500 Index pulled back more than 5% from its all-time high, marking the first 5% pullback of 2019. As we have discussed many times over the past two months, the odds were high that some type of pullback or even correction (10% or more off the highs) was likely after the 25% surge off the December 2018 lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-Corrections-are-normal.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; May likely will be the first negative month of the year (down nearly 6% with two days to go) and likely will be the first time stocks closed in the red in May since 2012.

&gt; Now, seasonality hints to more volatility ahead, as June doesn‚Äôt have the best history for stocks. ‚ÄúWe finally had a 5% pullback, but the bad news is June can be a tricky month for stocks,‚Äù explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúGoing back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May.‚Äù

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the day shows, stocks have tended to be weak in June over various periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Time-For-A-June-Swoon-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are six thoughts to chew on as we turn the calendar:

&gt; * When the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5% in May (like it could in 2019), June‚Äôs performance has been weak. May has lost 5% or more only four other times in the past 50 years, and stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June twice.
&gt; * However, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up more than 10% year to date heading into June (like it could in 2019), the S&amp;P 500 has gained 9 of the past 12 times (going back 50 years), and has been higher 1.9% on average.
&gt; * Equity markets in Greece, Brazil, India, Argentina, and Australia are all very strong. If we were truly entering a global recession, we would see more broad-based global weakness.
&gt; * The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) daily put/call ratio surged to its highest level since late December yesterday, suggesting a good deal of fear is coming into the market ‚Äì a necessary recipe for a bottom to form.
&gt; * Only 31% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 50-day moving average. This is nearing washout levels, but could need to go down to 20% before the ultimate low can form. Still, we are getting closer.
&gt; * The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey has more than 40% bears, the highest since the start of 2019. That‚Äôs another sign fear is spiking, and pessimism could be a bullish contrarian signal.

# DJIA Six Week Losing Streaks

&gt; Barring a 700+ point rally into the close (hey, anything is possible), the DJIA is on pace for its first six-week losing streak since June 2011 and the 32nd such streak going back to 1900. As of this writing, the DJIA is down 6.46% over the course of this current losing streak, which would go down as the mildest six-week losing streak for the index since June 1976 and the fifth 'mildest' six-week losing streak on record. The chart below highlights each of the DJIA's prior six-week losing streaks since 1900 and shows how much the index declined during each one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-Six-Week-losing-Streaks-1.png))**

&gt; While there have been quite a few six-week losing streaks for the DJIA in its history, it is not common for them to go on into a seventh week. As shown in the chart below, just seven of the DJIA's 32 prior six-week losing streaks have last seven or more weeks, and a 7-week losing streak stretching to an eighth week is practically unheard of with just one way back in 1923.

# DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Up Six Straight on June‚Äôs First Trading Day

&gt; According to the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2019 (page 86), the first trading day of June is the sixth best first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 299.85 points since 1998. Over the past 24 years, DJIA‚Äôs first trading day of June has produced gains 70.8% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 66.7% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 58.3% as has the Russell 2000 at 62.5%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced six straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Looking at the chart above, shaded areas highlight areas of strength during the month. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into negative territory just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap. This June could turn out better than average as a result of a strong start to the year and weakness in May.

# Strong Starts Weak Mays Boon for June

&gt; Our previous analysis of big gains the first four months indicated weakness was in store for the merry month of May. Now that the market has indeed suffered this May the outlook for June is a boon at least historically speaking.

&gt; The table below shows the top 20 first four month gains for the for the S&amp;P 500 with the subsequent changes for May, June, Rest of the Year, ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

&gt; May is weakest and May 2019 has delivered market declines so far, down -4.9% for the S&amp;P 500 as of today‚Äôs close. However, after big starts, 7 of the 9 subsequent May declines were followed by big gains in June (highlighted in green). So, while we do not anticipate much upside over the next 5 months or so, June is set up for a boon.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 5/31/19

&gt; This week's economic data came in split down the middle with 12 releases coming in worse than the prior period or estimates and another 12 improving. A remaining 3 met expectations or were unchanged from the previous period. We noted this same pattern in our Matrix of Economic Indicators for April. The FHFA's House Price Purchase Index for the first quarter was the first release of a shortened week coming in unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.1%. Monthly FHFA and Case-Shiller prices also came out on Tuesday with both showing slower home price growth. Later that morning the Conference Board's readings on Consumer Confidence came in stronger than both forecasts and the April reading. The final release Tuesday, the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity, disappointed at -5.3 versus expectations of 6.2. On Wednesday, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also came in below expectations but was stronger than the April reading. The second release of Q1 GDP was revised lower but less than expected with growth for Q1 now sitting at 3.1% QoQ SAAR. While consumption growth was stronger, that came thanks in part to inflation measures falling below estimates. Retail and Inventories grew more than expected in April as seen in their Thursday release. Pending home sales were also notably weak. Friday data was better with Personal Income and Spending numbers both beating estimates. Michigan Sentiment was the final release of the week with a reading of 100.0 versus forecasts of 101.5, both below the 102.4 reported in preliminary data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/053119-eco.png))**

&gt; With 34 releases, the data slate picks up next week. Monday we will get some important manufacturing data including the final data for May for the Markit PMI and ISM Manufacturing. Revisions for durable goods and the broader factory orders numbers for April will follow up on Tuesday. As next week is the first week of June, on Wednesday ADP will release their employment data for the month of May. This is expected to show fewer jobs created than April. The service portions of Markit PMIs and ISM will also come out Wednesday morning. In addition to the usual Thursday weekly releases, Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor Costs for the first quarter are expected. The Employment Situation Report with its Nonfarm Payrolls number will round out the week in economic data on Friday morning.

I work in the technology field and am thinking about investing in a cryptocurrency that a colleague has mentioned is doing well - could anybody share some advice (or point me in the direction of a good source) to a newbie?

Hey,

I'm pretty new to this, so i don't really know how one should properly invest.

I'm young, and i have some spare money lying around. Not enough to buy real estate, so the next thing would be, well stock.

I'm  thinking about buying (obviously), specifically AMD (Advanced Micro  Devices), but first of all, i don't know how to evaluate a company if  it's good, bad, neutral / long run, short run etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't plan to jump out, but rather have that sucker in there and just let it sit as don't need that money, so 100% long term.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question would be, do you think if it's a good/bad idea, and if it is how did you come to the conclusion.

Also,  if you don't wish to share (what is 100% understandable, every man for  himself), what material should i read that'd educate me on the subject  of the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks

I'm a sucker for tech, and like their datacenter portfolio (like the consumer too, but that's not where the real money is for them)"

Would just like to ask are there any recommendations off of anyone as to where or what I could do thanks?

stocks,"Hello r/stocks,

Futures point to another down day. I hope you are beginning to build your cash positions. Markets will retest December lows due to multiple issues.

Multi front trade wars with our biggest partners
Dem sweep possibility 2020 (tax cut reversal)
President impeachment
Recession from tarrifs
Tarrif retaliation from Mexico and China
Uncontrolled deficit
Corporate debt 

And for all we really know, the president is a Russian asset. Robert Mueller said he didn't have enough evidence to bring a conspiracy charge, not that there was no evidence. And Mueller didn't even look at trumps finances which is where the evidence would be. 

Almost everything he does would lead to that conclusion. Hates NATO, asks russia to hack the dnc, sides with Putin, implements tarrifs that will destroy the economy, blows up the deficit, refuses to sanction Russia or secure the elections. Well I could go on, but it just never stops.

stocks,"On Ulta Beauty's earnings call last week Mary Dillon CEO said that the newly proposed Canadian operation was not expected to be material to sales or income for the next two years but, interestingly, said that the company was seeking to ‚Äúbuild a foundation to become a global beauty retailer over the long term‚Äù adding that they were ‚Äúprepared to scale quickly as they learn and see success‚Äù. 


That seems sensible.  Ulta has had remarkable success domestically in a highly competitive market so opportunities in Canada, Europe and Asia would appear to be large and enticing.  However, international expansion has many potential pitfalls so starting slowly in an adjacent market is to be recommended.


Ulta‚Äôs business model of providing positive customer experiences, a huge range of top end to mass market beauty products and meaningful rewards program has provided compelling growth in the US.  This has generated a virtuous circle with new customers signing up, leading to top end brands competing to provide products driving further customer sign ups.   


Fears of a slowdown in Q4 growth failed to materialize and recent results have been strong with Q1 revenues up 13%, comps up 7%, profits up 17% and EPS up 21%.  Domestically, the company has 1,200 US stores and envisages this growing to 1,700.  That shows a substantial opportunity to grow even without international expansion.  


Trading on 26x current year estimates the valuation is appealing.  The domestic business is thriving and has a long way to grow while international expansions offers huge opportunities.


This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable investments for everyone. Please do your own research."

* Goldman Sachs (GS) sees increased risks of escalations of U.S. trade disputeswith China and Mexico.

Some of the nation's automakers issue May sales today, although Ford (F) and GM (GM) only report on a quarterly basis. There are no major earnings this morning. Box (BOX) releases its quarterly number after today's closing bell.

&gt;Sell Tesla: Falling Gas Prices, The Next Demand Headache
The article was submitted Friday at 3pm, but that's just one in many.

Today's NY Times article: 

Can Tesla Ever Be More Than a Niche Automaker? Wall St. Increasingly Thinks No

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/dealbook/tesla-stock-price.html


If you don't know what a bear raid is, it's this:

&gt; A bear raid is the illegal practice of ganging up to push a stock's price lower through concerted short selling and spreading adverse rumors about the targeted company. A bear raid is sometimes resorted to by unscrupulous short sellers who want to make a quick buck from their short positions."
stocks,"I have owned one stock of a company for a quite a while - long enough to get a dividend.

stocks,"Hey,   


So, I decided to give the whole stock market thing a bash. I'm really in for a long-term (3+years) and have decided mostly on tech heavy stocks because it's what I know best. I was aware of the whole tarrif war, but thought since I'm looking long term it probably will average out. However, having invested using leverage I am worried that if the recent downturn continues I will be below the minimum margin and positions may be closed automatically. Basically, what do I do in the this case? Again, total newbie.  


For e.g. do I wait out the dip and hope? do I put money into the account to provide sufficient equity? do I buy more stocks and/or diversify into other markets?  


Also, say I ""survive"" the coming dip, do I counter the loss by investing more when it starts to recover?  


tldr; newbie, leverage be scary"
stocks,"I have nearly 100% of my holdings in SPTM. I have also purchased a small number of assorted holdings (weed companies, buttcoins, a dash of additional tech and some other stupid shit here and there) that aren't a part of SPTM to give me some exposure to other assets without influencing too much of my portfolio's total market track.

To those of you who invest in the total market, do any of you purchase small holdings in companies, whose price correlation coefficients against total market funds are low, to add additional exposures to your portfolio? If so, what are they? I'm hoping to learn about what other people think is worthy of holding when something like VTI is doing most of the heavy lifting. thanks very much for your time."

Currently I see the price levels being oversold; though it can produce false signals. SPY would decline because trade deal isn't looking so good, esp. China becoming more aggressive. My speculation is IF another correction is due, I wouldn't expect SPY to drop further than 250; I would consider this level to be the maximum. I don't think the trade deal is big of an issue that's going to be the reason for greater correction (where people target SP500 to drop insane amount like 15%, 25%, even 40%). In economic standpoint, trade deal has the potential for massive drop, but I just don't see that the deal with China is gonna be SO BAD that it'll cause a massive selloff.

Lyft shares increased more than 5% on Friday, gaining more than $800 million in value. The market cap is now $16.8 billion compared to Uber‚Äôs $67 billion. Just like Uber, Lyft has incurred large losses thanks to consistent promotions. Lyft reported an adjusted per-share loss of $9.02.

Now that both ride-sharing services are public, riders can expect fewer deals. But, if price point becomes a determining factor for riders, then Uber likely has the advantage, since Lyft is a quarter of the size of Uber.

**- The ETF tracks video game publishers, streaming network operators and hardware companies that have established themselves as key players in the esports, or electronic sports, industry.**


**- Roundhill and Bitkraft used that definition to select the 25 stocks in the ETF, which is mostly made of game publishers such as Activision Blizzard and Take-Two. However, hardware-related names such as chipmaker Nvidia, which has been involved in esports for years, also feature in the holdings.**


**- Over half of the stocks in the ETF are Asian companies, many of which have a more broad-based foothold in the esports space. For example, AfreecaTV, a South Korean video streaming service known for broadcasting and sponsoring esports teams, leagues and events, is the biggest holding in NERD.**


**- Research firm Newzoo projects that the esports industry will raise over $1 billion in revenue this year.**


**- Esports investments in 2018 had exceeded $4 billion in disclosed funding by November, according to Esports Observer.**

stocks,"U.S. stock index futures gave back some of their gains on Wednesday after the release of much weaker-than-expected jobs data.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 63  points higher, indicating a gain of 72 points at the open. Dow futures pointed to a gain of more than 170 points earlier. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also trimmed gains.

Private payrolls increased by just 27,000 in May, according to data from ADP and Moody‚Äôs Analytics. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 173,00 jobs. May‚Äôs print was the worst since March 2010.

Treasury yields fell on the news. The benchmark 10-year yield traded at 2.09% while the 2-year rate hit its lowest level since December 2017.

The weak data added to the concerns that the economy was slowing while the U.S. takes a tough stance on trade with key partners like China and Mexico.

stocks,"All over the world banks lend money to diamond business with reluctance now. As the result it caused terrible consequences for diamond miners and for gem wholesalers. But retail prices are considered to be stable as the changes on the diamond market won‚Äôt be accepted by the engaged couples who stimulate the demand. But that's what diamond manufacturers want to believe in.

Changes in the diamonds industry were firstly caused by new regulations with the aim to prevent a financial crisis.  Secondly, there was a massive anticorruption campaign, which made Chinese, who were one of the main diamond consumers, out of the market: they were banned of owning jewellery, which has already led to significant decrease of sales in Asian region.

The government pressure made banks in their turn act more carefully, especially when lending credits to the diamond manufacturers. Many banks simply stopped serving the diamond industry. For example, the Belgian bank KBC closed a branch unit in Antwerp, which was a rival for diamond manufacturers all over the world for many years. Bank Leumi in Israel had got out of the diamond business too, as well as ABN Amro in the Netherlands. 

Needless to say, that there a lots of manufacturers simply can't survive without banks' support. Why is this happening? Why the banks are getting out of diamond business? You can read the answer in our next post."

stocks,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Lately my strategy has been providing decent returns, but commissions on my trades has been eating away at my profits. Is it a good idea to account for the money lost to commissions when setting when to take profit or to have a stop loss? The idea I had to do this was as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

Say my broker has a 2% commission on trades, which means that they will essentially take 4% of my profits per trade. 

Lets say I am buying 50 shares of XYZ which is currently at $10 and want to make $5/share (or 5\*50 = $250). With no fees, I would take profit at $15. However, commissions would take 50\*10\*0.02 = 20 dollars from this trade, so I would really only be making $230/$4.60 per share and lose out on 8% of my ""ideal"" gain ((230-250)/250). 

If I want to include the loss of commissions, I would instead place my take profit at $15.40 and also place my stop loss $0.40 higher than what my strategy would suggest. This would give me the desired $5/share.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a good adjustment?"

stocks,"When Beyond Meat IPOed May 2, it was originally proposed to be syndicated by underwriters within the range of $19 to $21 a share. By the time it had priced at $24, the higher end of a pricing range that was revised upwards, Beyond had raised approximately $231 million in IPO proceeds. When listed the free float was equal to 18.5% of the treasury stock method calculation of the fully-diluted shares outstanding, and the stock began trading at $46 a share off the propitious mechanics of an IPO with a constrained float and a low amount of newly offered shares as a percent of the existing preferreds. Beyond Meat is a consumer staple company that manufacturers and brands plant-based protein offerings that intend to be a simulacrum in taste and appearance to animal meat products and therefore a substitute to them, supposedly, for the environmentally and animal treatment conscious. Owing to this fact, Beyond Meat has repeatedly stated in their S-1/A that meat-lovers comprise the majority of their $35 billion TAM, requesting from retailers that their flagship product the Beyond Burger be carried adjacent to animal meat products. Beyond Meat's lofty goal of marketing plant-based protein patties to meat lovers on the premise of a secular shift towards consumer preferences being determined by ESG-related factors is admirable and by virtue of its decision and ability to successfully raise proceeds from the markets it remains a promising indicator of the strength of cause conscious consumer decision-making. However, although its mission and brand commitment is cohesive, the likelihood of it being realized beyond the extent to which the company has grown impressively for two years on the back of celebrity endorsement and the novelty value is slim. Most importantly, Beyond Meat's unflinching desire to cater to animal meat eaters by developing products whose distinction from other plant-based protein alternatives is drawn by their similarity to animal meat is an explanation for recent growth but also an impediment to sustaining its trajectory which would've been otherwise impossible but for a strategy built around earned media impressions. Evidence for the success of Beyond Meat's determination to achieve recurring sales traction from meat lovers is spurious and has undoubtedly resulted in net income losses and an accumulated deficit. For example, in Beyond's S-1 they mentioned "" At one of the nation‚Äôs largest conventional grocers, Kroger, 93% of Beyond Burger buyers over the 26-week period ended June 30, 2018 also purchased animal protein during the same period, which evidences Beyond Meat‚Äôs appeal to meat-loving consumers."" However, this can¬†also be interpreted as evidence that those who purchase Beyond Burgers during a half-a-year period may have only done so once out of curiosity before returning to their meat based mains. It seems more likely that the minority 7% of Beyond Burger Buyers who only purchased Beyond Burger meat during the time period is more reflective of the extent to which customers who peruse the meat aisle may only devote themselves to purchasing plant based alternatives.¬†From hiring 63 full-time employees in R&amp;D related fields and spending an average of 21% of net revenue on R&amp;D (Tyson Foods spends .3% on R&amp;D) to spending 40% of revenue on SG&amp;A expenses for the full year of 2018, even with margins expanding and expenses contracting as a percentage of net revenue, Beyond Meat's future performance cannot meet the expectations of those who have bidded up the stock to a value which implies a price to revenue exceeding 70 times. Assuming 30% top-line CAGR over 10 years, 24 pps gross margin expansion which already remains above that of Tyson foods whose gross margin has flat-lined at 12% for the past two years, 25 pps reduction in S&amp;M as a percent of revenue which remains the largest OPEX component, 14% wacc, and a 5% terminal growth rate, yields a fair value of $42. Assuming less lenient operating leverage as packaged food manufacturers tend to have less leeway in their ability to ameliorate their gross margins, with 41% revenue CAGR and a end of projected period NOPAT margin of 8%, we receive a fair-value price in a dcf framework that justifies the top of the IPO price range of $25 a share. Currently, Beyond Meat carries a hard-to-borrow rate of over 100% annualized for new shorts and the options markets imply a hard-to-borrow rate of 94.09%. I would short Beyond Meat either expressed through stock or an equivalent option position once the larger portion of the float which remains currently locked-up becomes free in November.¬†"

&amp;#x200B;

E.G. saving 30K/yr ... Traditional IRA max contribution is 6K... tax deductible but will have to pay tax @ time of withdraw.  Roth IRA is still 6K contribution max but after-tax funded (and then we can't touch our money).  Is a 6K tax deduction worth it if it is not a 1:1

Why go with an IRA when we can dump our money into ETF's, e.g. IVV, VTI, SPY, etc.... plus pick some high dividend stocks like Ford.

My reasons for believing in long-term sustainable growth in this company are:

\- The growing size of the middle class in China

\- China's general upward economic trend (despite the recent trade war effects, I still believe China is on the rise economically)

\- [JD.com](https://JD.com)'s business strategy is incredibly comparable to that of Amazon.  The largely break even in cash and profit because they're using all of their resources to invest in the future.

\- The logistics system that they have built and are continuing to build is unrivaled and will be incredibly difficult for any competitor to try to match

I also have my IFC and CSC Investment designations and working as a Financial analyst/Credit specialist.            

I‚Äôve always had strong interest in investing even prior to taking my business degree. 

And although I‚Äôm currently making a decent amount in terms of investments in hopes to one day make it my primary income.. I feel as if I‚Äôm missing out on some type of secret analysis that gives these kids an edge in investing? 

By this regard, I feel like dropping out of school and using the extra couple of years to I would of used to complete my Masters would be better suited to enhance my knowledge in investing.

I‚Äôm talking about individuals for example, like ‚Äú Tim Grattini‚Äù who is a young man who started off not knowing anything about investments and somehow became a millionaire by turning $1,500 to over $3Mill by investing primarily in penny stocks and using technical analysis as his main valuation tool.

or Ricky Gutierrez who became a very young millionaire within a couple of years by investing in growth/small-cap stocks on the other hand? ( There‚Äôs s video on YouTube on him called ‚Äú Making $11,000 vs $65 a Day). Pretty much a video on the day to day lives of a young trader vs an Uber driver. And how ppl that are broke actually work harder than the rich. 



I‚Äôm currently a University student majoring in Finance working my way towards my Masters Degree and have been very passionately interested in investing even prior to becoming a student. I also have my IFC and CSC Investment designations and am currently working as a Financial/Investment analyst intern for an IB. 

I have learned and applied enough knowledge from school and prior experience from investing to make a decent amount in investments from a portfolio of growth/small cap stocks, mutual funds, and equity ETF‚Äôs. Although I feel like I‚Äôm missing a secret analysis or evaluation tool that these people are using to become successful faster that I might missing out on? 

From what I can take here is what I know so far in terms of how these individuals became successful investors within a short period of time AND with not a lot of money to start:   

&gt; They knew nothing about how investments works, but this was compensated for the 5-6 hrs a day they passionately spent educating themselves about investments and in addition, giving them a lot of experience within a shorter period of time. 

&gt; Most were very speculative and had a high risk tolerance, investing primarily in growth stocks, penny stocks, hedging, implementing calls and puts etc. and taking advantage of market volatility.

&gt; All these individuals invested on Margin and were highly (50% or more leveraged). 

&gt; Most used technical analysis as opposed to Fundamental analysis as their main valuation tool. These include tracking chart patterns, historical and trend patterns, the use of moving averages etc. And some were contrarian investors. ( When most ppl are buying your are selling and vice versa). 
 
Now, what are your guys thoughts on how people like these are able to achieve this with little or no knowledge/experience in investing and not a lot of money and end up becoming wealthy within such a short time period? By intelligence and having strong analytical skills or just plain luck? 

Btw, any additional tips or advice on investing would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

Boeing is talking to families of the victims from the Lion Air 737 Max crash about reaching a settlement, rather than going through the court system.

Settling would allow Boeing to avoid long, highly publicized trials which could prove damaging for Boeing as its conduct around the crash is scrutinized and it seeks to return the planes to service.

A lawyer representing multiple families told Business Insider it is in Boeing's ""best interest"" to settle, as it would stop lawyers going through evidence to see if there were any issues with how the company designed and made the plane.

But he warned that Boeing could be using a wider strategy to drive down the settlement price."

I'd imagine Howard would want to keep the price high, since as far as I know, he has tens if not hundreds of millions worth of stock still. Maybe he'd sell before announcing?

What else does SiriusXM really have? Everyone I've ever met who subscribes does it for Howard. I listen to maybe 1-3 other channels, *sometimes.* He carries that company IMO.

Sure you get subscriptions when you purchase a new car through GM or Ford that lasts a few months, but outside of Howard, I don't know what else I'd personally keep subscribing for.

stocks,"Hello. I was wondering if someone can verify if i am correct or not in my understanding. And help with some questions I may have. I did couple readings on investopedia.

Looking at perspective of single and filing single.

1. you can move your capital loss deduction to future years. not locked into using it for the tax year you got your loss from.

2. short term capital gains is taxed at normal tax brackets. long term is much less.

3. you can deduct a max of $1500 on capital loss to your total taxable income. meaning if you had a net realized capital loss of $2000, you can apply $1500 in deductions and move $500 for future deductions (whether that be next year, or 10 years from now)

4. basic strategy in using capital loss deduction is to move you to a lower tax bracket. example assuming 2019 tax bracket is same for next year. lets say someone had a capital loss of $1400. his W2 income is $40,300. meaning $825 gets taxed at 22%. if he applies $825 of his $1400 capital loss, it brings him down to $39,475, or at the very edge of 12% tax rate. effectively putting him in the 12% tax bracket. and he can move his $575 left of capital loss for future use.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, it's not only USA that's lowering its rates - Australia is at 1.25% and New Zealand is at 1.5% - all levels which haven't been seen since the great recession.

What needs to be done is to wind down the business, return as much cash as possible to creditors and shareholders and let investors seek opportunities in other businesses.  

Honestly if they had come up with a new plan to justify the dividend cut I might have given it the benefit of the doubt.  But to just cut the dividend to blue sky their options is the best way to eliminate shareholder value.

# **The market week ahead: Mexico tariffs and more data that may clear the way for a rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/weekahead-domm-190607-ec.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks have been rallying hard on the idea the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon, but at some point the market needs to see progress on the trade wars and economic weakness that are bothering the Fed.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs surprisingly soft May jobs report showed just 75,000 jobs created, 100,000 less than expected. That immediately raised expectations that the Fed could cut rates as early as July because the long resilient labor market is now seeing the impact of what has already been showing up in manufacturing data.
*****
&gt; The stumble in the labor market raises concerns that trade-related weakness in manufacturing will creep into other sectors of the economy. For that reason, economic data, particularly CPI inflation data Wednesday, could be a key market factor in the week ahead, as investors attempt to game when the Fed could cut rates. There are also retail sales and industrial production on Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think investors will be nervous around trade and tariffs. Those will continue to drive sentiment next week. I think it‚Äôs interesting that you have this idea that the ‚ÄòPowell put,‚Äô the central banks, come in to save the day,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ‚ÄúIt may feel good for investors, and it may extend the cycle longer, but I do think it compounds the longer term problems...Eventually this is going to catch up with the market in some way or other.‚Äù
*****
&gt; **Mexico tariffs**
&gt; Investors are awaiting any developments in China, U.S. trade relations, and they are also closely watching developments with Mexico. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs of 25% on all Mexican goods, starting with a 5% tariff on Monday, if Mexico does not show that it is making progress in stopping migrants from reaching the U.S. On Friday, Trump said in a tweet there‚Äôs a good chance a deal will be made with Mexico.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market was shrugging it off this week. It‚Äôs been a strong week for the market, so [investors] seems to be taking it in stride,‚Äù said Arone, noting investors were looking past the Mexican tariffs for now and focused on the Fed rate cuts. ‚ÄúThe market seems to be applauding [rate cuts] right now, but I‚Äôm not sure accommodative monetary policy in itself is enough of a catalyst for better economic growth and better earnings. We need more than that. This could be a bit of a quick hit or a sugar high.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied after the jobs report, with Friday‚Äôs gains capping what was already setting up to be the strongest week for stocks since November. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4.4% for the week, ending Friday at 2,873. Treasury yields fell to the lowest levels since December, 2017 in the past week, with the 10-year touching 2.05% on Friday. Fed funds futures also moved sharply, and were forecasting a 95% chance for a quarter point rate cut in July.
*****
&gt; Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO, said the markets are now focused on the timing of a possible Fed rate cut and whether the Fed would cut by a quarter point or a half point initially. That makes economic data especially important, as investors watch to see if weakness has spread to consumers, in the upcoming retail sales report Friday, or whether inflation is weakening. Core CPI has been running above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou would think the [fed funds futures] market is gravitating toward one cut in July, one cut in September and another in December. We have 2.9, 25 basis rate cuts priced in for 2019. This really raises the stakes for next week‚Äôs CPI, given core year over year CPI is over 2%, and also now because we‚Äôre in the Fed blackout period. There won‚Äôt be any additional guidance coming out of the Fed this week.,‚Äù said Hill. Fed officials do not speak publicly just ahead of meetings, and they are scheduled to meet June 18.
*****
&gt; Strategists have said the market is also holding up on the idea that President Donald Trump would not allow the trade conflicts to get so out of hand that they will cause a stock market collapse, since he views the market as a reflection of his success. That‚Äôs the so-called ‚ÄòTrump put.‚Äô
*****
&gt; Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, J.P. Morgan equity strategist, said if Trump proceeds with his threat to put tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods that could spark a major sell-off in stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 could go as low as 2,500. But he also expects that sell-off would result in both a ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô put and a Fed ‚Äòput,‚Äô meaning Trump would take some action and the Fed could cut rates to ease financial conditions and help the economy. The strategist said he is maintaining his 3,000 target on the S&amp;P for the year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe believe the next round of tariffs that the Trump administration is threatening‚ÄîMexico 5% and China Phase III‚Äîcould substantially increase the risk of pushing the U.S. business and profit cycle into an outright contraction,‚Äù he wrote. Lakos-Bujas said he still expects trade agreements to be reached, in part because the Trump administration will not want to risk a market collapse or recession, ahead of an election.
*****
&gt; Lakos-Bujas said there are a wide range of possible outcomes, including a positive scenario where trade peace is achieved, earnings improve and the S&amp;P shoots higher to 3,200.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, investors will also be keeping an eye on China‚Äôs data. On Monday, China reports balance of trade, imports and exports, first quarter GDP, current account and foreign exchange reserves. Chinese inflation data is released on Wednesday.

# Not a Triple Top Yet ‚Äì Support Has Held

&gt; There has been a lot of chatter recently about an imminent ‚Äútriple top‚Äô for the market across the January 2018, September 2018 and recent April 30, 2019 highs. It‚Äôs not a triple top until it breaks support levels. Traders do need to be watching for support levels to be broken - which we have recently held.

&gt; Holding support was bullish technical action. But remember this is the Worst Six Months and we expect more volatility, more testing of support and more sideways action ‚Äì backing and filling ‚Äì over the weaker summer months.

&gt; We talked about these support levels on the blog a month ago as well. Here‚Äôs an update to the chart from that May 7 blog post. I added some additional support levels. S&amp;P 500 level of 2580 at February/April 2018lows is critical support ‚Äì a 12.4% correction.

&gt; Breaking that level would bring the December 2018 lows into play, which would be bear market territory of -20% ‚Äì and likely the low and a great buying opportunity. Good thing we are already in Worst Six Months Defense Mode since we shifted to market neutral after our official Best Six Months MACD Seasonal Sell signal for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 on May 1.

# Seasonally, Bonds Have Plenty of Room Left to Run

&gt; Barring some rather abrupt reversal in the current trend in trade, tariffs, tariffs and even higher tariffs, bonds could have even more upside in their near-term futures. Back in the beginning of April we noted the 30-year treasury bond had a seasonal tendency to dip in April and early May (around the time stocks like to make a seasonal high) before moving higher from sometime in May through the end of August. Thus far this year this trade has been a perfect textbook setup. 

&gt; In the following chart weekly bars of the 30-year Treasury bond future appear on top with their seasonal trend since August 26, 1977. The 30-year Treasury bond did dip in April and as trade war concerns grew in May, as stocks slipped, bonds ripped higher. The recent rise has been brisk but considering the retreat in tech stocks further gains are not out of the question.

# The Bespoke Report -- Negative Void Coefficient

&gt; Equity markets surged despite short term interest rate markets pricing near-certainty of multiple Fed rate cuts this year. How can an economy so bad that the Fed needs to cut mean stocks go up? We take a look around for some answers. We also review just how dovish the Fed has been relative to what markets have been pricing of late. While the domestic economy has definitely slowed down from the torrid pace of 2018, even the disappointing nonfarm payrolls number today paints a different picture than assumptions of multiple cuts from the front end. The global economy is less constructive, but there's a difference between weakness and a recession panic, as we show. Finally, we present an argument for why Fed rate cuts may not be necessary for the economy to stabilize and start to pick up again thanks to negative feedback loops.

stocks,"I invested in both Visa and Mastecard and they have done great so far! I would love to put more money into the two companies because I think that we are most certainly moving towards a cashless economy, slowly but surely. Then on the other hand I'm worried if it's not a smart investment because of companies such as PayPal. I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the payment processing/network industry so maybe my fear might be baseless. Is the adoption of payment platforms such as paytm, WeChat pay and alipay in Asia a threat to visa and MasterCard? I'd love to hear what people think about this."

Does anyone have any feedback or a review on it?"

stocks,"I already have investments with Fidelity so I considered opening a ‚ÄúBrokerage Account‚Äù with them.  

Pros: strong set of tools for research and value tracking.   In addition to stocks, I can trade bonds, options, and ETFs.  I‚Äôm interested in trading ETFs and I have no idea if most brokerage firms offer this. 

Cons:   $2500 deposit to start (not a problem for me).  
‚Äú $4.95 commission on all online U.S. equity trades‚Äù.   What?   $5/trade?   Is this preposterous or is this normal?  Am I correct to understand that my cost to buy-hold-sell a simple stock purchase is $10?

I‚Äôm not a day trader.  I‚Äôm a week trader (arguably a weak trader, LOL).  I expect to buy/sell a couple positions a week at most.    I‚Äôm lucky to have enough savings that I feel safe risking a 4-digit number into my own market beliefs.   

TLDR:  Is $5 commission normal?  Avoidable?"

stocks,"The exotic nature of diamonds offers enormous opportunities and advantages for money laundering and tax evasion. Precious gems developed an international supply chain which became a result of billions in losses each year. According to an investigative report of Global Witness, which fights natural resource exploitation, diamonds sales have been noticed on the markets of Facebook and What‚ÄôsApp. 

The United Nations did their best to stop the flow of diamonds and in 2000 came to the decision ‚ÄúKimberley Process‚Äù which presents a three-step verification to make diamond mining countries provide declarations on each stone. Now the system of export and import control works in 75 countries. Nevertheless, the resolution covers only rough diamonds used by rebel groups to finance wars against legitimate governments what means that jewellery market is not under supervision yet. 

‚ÄúWe see document tampering where one stone has been claimed across similar timelines with multiple insurers,‚Äù says Leanne Kemp, CEO and founder of Everledger, a company that uses blockchain to track and protect precious stones. They create a unique thumbprint on each stone, and now their blockchain system collects 1.6 mln diamonds providing information about authenticity and provenance of gems. So, the blockchain technology prevents double financing, or lab-grown stones from being falsely identified.   
Though, blockchain is used to make the global diamond market transparent and secure, it makes life easy only for manufactories, not for customers. That‚Äôs why we are creating Diamond Open Market which will be available to everyone and provide you with fair prices what is unicity on this monopolized market."

&amp;#x200B;

I am new into stocks. I would like to know how can someone build a strategy to sell stocks and fundamental difference between stocks and options?

Let's use AAPL as a case study, and assume that the stock price stays steady while we are holding the stocks. Let's say that it's currently trading at $177, lets say we have $1770 total liquidity, enough for 10 shares. Let's say that after one day, it becomes $177.5, it means that I can cash $1775. The profit after a day is 5$ - (fees of buy/sell). 

  
I am legitimately trying to understand the fundamental difference between buying and selling stocks this way, and dealing with options  (selling calls and puts frequently). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for vague comments, I genuinely want some clarity."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;.... Now, Stem Holdings is releasing video of a new farm for Cannabis cultivation and processing. The Mulino Farm is now in full operation, signifying the companies goals being met of establishing a large number of new growing fields. This new push in company activity is now in line with a number of larger Cannabis operations, possibly allowing the company to now focus on uplisting to NASDAQ, or similar stock exchanges. Currently trading at $1.60, with a 52-week range to $7.15, this puts the company on the radar of analysts and investors in Canada and the USA."
stocks,Does there have to be a specific interest in only two shares to get someone to buy?  Selling DATA after this mornings announcement.  Sucky stock for a long time just want to get rid of it after this bump.
stocks,"Interested on what your thoughts are on buying in on any of these stocks. Some of these are at 52 week highs, however I am in for the long term. Are there any that you would buy in now  and ones you would watch a bit longer? Also looking into the upcoming IPO of Chewy and Crowdstrike.

&amp;#x200B;

The only one of the bunch I currently own is GOOG (CB of $620). Looking to get more involved/active in my portfolio. Have long holds for the last 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any input. :)

stocks,"Hi all!

When talks about a trade war with China began in the past month, I sold all of my positions expecting stocks to go lower. As prices went lower, I very slowly averaged into stocks where I liked the price and bought long-term holdings. This is my current portfolio that i've built within the last month. 

Most of my positions are technology and healthcare, and i'm looking to add more names to better diversify my portfolio. To do this, I bought a position in Chevron, Beyond Meat and Altria.

I'm looking for some other names to add to my portfolio and I was wondering if you guys could give me some recommendations? Perhaps there are stocks from consumer discretionary, staples or materials that you think are worth adding to a long-term portfolio?

Right now i'm looking to add Procter and Gamble, Berkshire and Boeing.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, when can I sell the stock and still get the dividend? If I sell before the payable date, will I still get it?

Thanks!"
stocks,Just curious. I see a lot of posts about ‚Äúah I sold at 80 and now it‚Äôs 160‚Äù (BYND I‚Äôm looking at you üòÇ) and not a lot of the converse. Any good stories about either??
stocks,"In diamond industry the frauds are possible due the dependance of the market players on bank‚Äôs loans. And the story of Nirav Modi, arrested in London in March 2019, is one of these. 

Celebrity jewelry designer Nirav Modi, coming from a family of diamantaires, was born in India, but grew up in Antwerp. After drop out of the college, Modi joined his family in diamond business and started to import duty-free cut and polished diamonds to the domestic market while sending low-value diamonds for making export jewellery. His  brand Firestar Diamonds became one of the most reputable across three continents with stores in London, New York, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Singapore, Beijing and Mumbai.

In January 2017 the Income Tax department of India raided over 50 offices of Modi and found cash and jewellery that allegedly revealed tax evasion of Rs 500 crore ($5 bln) by Modi‚Äôs firms. But that was just the beginning. Soon the State-owned Punjab National Bank has filed a complaint, accusing Modi and his firms of fraudulent transactions worth Rs 11,000 crore  ($110 bln) ‚Äî nearly one third of the PNB‚Äôs net worth for financial year 2017. 

It was later revealed that two of the bank‚Äôs employees helped Modi by issuing fraudulent letters of undertakings (LOUs). The bank stated that accused firms presented a set of letters of undertakings with a request to allow buyers‚Äô credit for making payments to overseas suppliers. No need to say, Nirav Modi was not going to refund these money.

Nirav Modi is now arrested. But how many more Modis are out there today, serving the inflated inclosed diamond market needs? 

With Diamond Market opened these scams will forever be history."

My portfolio is currently focused on growth, but some people say that I should be aiming for income. Is it an age thing, or just personal preference? Is one better than the other for certain goals?"

stocks,"Thinking about buying my first stocks soon. I want to purchase MSFT, DIS, V, and UNH. Analysts rate them all as ""Buy"", but are these safe enough to buy at their current prices ( I plan on holding them long term ), or should I wait for them to fall? I keep seeing people say that their is a downturn coming. Thank you for the help, please go easy on me."
stocks,"Beyond Meat ($BYND) shares moved higher once again Monday morning. The stock persists at higher than expected levels after one of the most successful IPOs of 2018 2019 so far.

The next closest IPO of 2018-2019 has been Zoom Video ($ZM) which is up a mere 185% compared to Beyond Meat‚Äôs 600%. For comparison Uber ($Uber) is down 3% while Lyft ($LYFT) is down 18%.

Beyond Meat shares jumped as much as 34% to $186.43 per share on Monday, marking an all-time high for the company that claims to be ‚ÄúThe Future of Protein‚Äù. Shares for the company closed on Friday at $138.65. The IPO price was $25 per share.

Shares, which began trading publicly May 2, have soared altogether 560%, reaching a market value of approximately $10 billion. This forward price-to-sales ratio of 35 seems unsustainable. Tyson Food, for instance, trades for 0.7 times their sales. Credit Suisse analysts see a price target on Beyond Meat shares of $125 based on the company‚Äôs first-quarter report, as well as a 2030 sales estimate of $3.5 billion. Beyond Meat is trading for about twice that 2030 sales estimate.

According to Nielsen, Beyond Meat enjoys just 2% household penetration in the United States. That suggests room to grow for some. But, whether or not the omnivorous American consumer will ditch simple beef or an ultra-processed alternative remains to be seen.

To be sure, the U.S. market certainly isn‚Äôt the only one Beyond Meat is looking at. CFO Mark Nelson called Europe and Asia ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù markets for Beyond Meat. He noted that Europe already has a ‚Äúvery well-developed market‚Äù for plant-based proteins.

stocks,"Just turned 20 a few weeks ago and just started investing late last year.

I have almost $9500 invested in stocks right now. 45% of it is in Broadcom, 37% on Amazon, and the rest is in Netflix. I see Amazon as more of a long term stock because it‚Äôs innovative whereas Netflix I don‚Äôt see a future for products beyond just tv shows and movies. My thinking behind Broadcom is it‚Äôs been a good dividend stock and it can help me add to my shares of Netflix and Amazon.

Do you picture Amazon as a long term stock because I‚Äôm new to investing but it seems like a company that should be successful for decades to come where I‚Äôm not sure with Netflix?"

stocks,"so for example say I'm day trading a stock that's under 10$ a share which would put one percent at .10 and this stock for the last 3-5 years has been trending up. if I try and time the daily lows and sell at 1 percent gain. never trading at a loss by holding until profitable, for 100 trading days with a starting capital of 30000 so by my math would be 30000*1.01^100 would put me up at 81000 or 50000 gain in less than a year. seems to easy what am I missing? other than the obvious never rebounding it seems like a sure fire strategy and I can't find any holes in it."

This analysis will use three indicators (SMA 10, MACD, SlowStochastic) on a 15-year chart with monthly candles as proposed by Phil Town. These indicators can give independent BUY/SELL signals, but we will use the three in harmony with each other for a concrete signal. It is important to note we only recognize a signal once the month has ended and the candle is completed. The SMA 10 signals are quite simple. If price action ends the month above the SMA, the security issues a BUY signal, and vice versa, if price action ends the month below the SMA, it issues a SELL signal. The MACD is fairly simple as well. When the histogram turns green, a BUY signal is issued, but when it turns red, a SELL signal is issued. The Slow Stochastic indicator can be a bit trickier to understand. A cross above 80 is always considered as a BUY signal, while a cross below 20 is always considered a SELL signal. The phantom zone is described as being between 20 and 80. When in the phantom zone, the signal takes on whatever the other two indicators issue. When all three signals issue a BUY or a SELL at the same time, we can use these signals execute trades.

2018 started off with all three indicators giving off positive BUY signals (price action above SMA, MACD = green, Slow Stochastic above phantom zone). The MACD turned red in April 2018 while price action breached the SMA multiple times from February through May. However, the price action never ENDED the month below the SMA until October 2018, issuing a SELL signal for this indicator. Since the Slow Stochastic entered the phantom zone while the SMA and MACD were at SELL, its signal changes to SELL as well. Hence, all three indicators issue a SELL as of October 2018. Price action this February ended above the SMA, issuing a BUY signal for this indicator, continuing into March and April. This May, price action ended below the SMA, so a SELL signal is issued. However, the MACD remains at a SELL as of the end of May 2019. Closing April 2019, the Slow Stochastic moved above the phantom zone, issuing a BUY for this signal. SMA: SELL; MACD: SELL; SS: BUY.

I learned to used these indicators together through Phil Town.
