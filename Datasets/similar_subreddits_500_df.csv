14,gaming,"I believe that to make a successful RPG, you have to have two things. 

Interesting game mechanics and a good story. 

But I have been thinking alot about which RPG games i enjoy mechanically and I just cant remember any game I enjoyed in that way. I think on this as ""gameplay loop"" where you do an activity in a game to increase level and by that extension progress further in the story.

The worst example in recent history I can think of is probaly Cyberpunk 2077, because while there is interesting story in it, there is also gigs which just fills the map and in my opinion dosn't bring any value to the game.

Which RPG game did you enjoy the most mechanically?",0

I know RDR2 is more simulator-like with the many levels of customization and activities you can do in the game, and HZD seems more arcade-y with a greater focus on combat and story.

Competitive multiplayer on the other hand can and does use the full potential of the battle system. Whether it be through VGC or Smogon, you're pushed to play at the absolute best level you possibly can.

Smogon in particular is great because the tiering system means nearly every Pokemon in existence has at least a niche use in some tier. Even the worst of the worst, like Regigigas and Slaking, can be used in the lower tiers.

It allows for a lot more diversity and thoughtful teambuilding. You can create a near infinite number of unique and fun teams.",0

Big spoiler incoming. If you're still here and don't want to spoil CP2077, please go away.  


I've recently played through Cyberpunk and to be honest I'm disappointed with the story. The thing that struck me the most was the part near the end, just before deciding how to approach the offer from Hanako. V woke up from a serious blackout and talked briefly with Victor. He said something that  V should end it on his own terms. I wasn't really sure what he meant, but then he proceeded to show me a pistol and a pill. I was immediately hit by a thought that this guy just adviced V to kill himslef. I was really into my chracter by that point and I genuinly thought it would fit my V's personality to just put a bullet in his head in that moment. Everything clicked in the right place. So after that I had a talk with Johnny, already mentally prepared for V to commit suicide and... there is no option to do that.  


It was a perfect place for an alternate ending. I cant describe how disappointed I was after that.

City states you are at war with obviously won’t entertain your requests for money, troops, building material, etc. However, if your city is suffering from a famine and your people are starving, even your enemies will begrudgingly send you food to alleviate your citizens’ suffering.

BioShock infinite was very acclaimed at release but there were still a lot of people who didn't like the massive shift in setting, yet it's responsible for nearly half of the series sales

This can be called good place / bad place, or whatever you prefer since heaven/hell may be overly religious for your tastes. However, I’m using these terms as shorthand for now. Heaven can be based off an end city, and hell, the nether.

So, what determines if you get sent to heaven or hell? My rough idea is that every block placed or animal fed is a point to heaven, and every non-agro mob (animals, villagers, etc.) killed is a point to hell. Depending on which side gets more points when you die, that’s where you go. If your points are tied, you go into limbo, or spectator mode (like in hardcore).

231,gaming,"I was running through a list of roguelikes in my head. One of them is an older one called Has Been Heroes. It's generally rated 5/10 and I've never heard people talk about it. But I thought it was great.

You get three dudes - a guy who attacks once, a guy who hits twice, and a guy who hits three times. There are three Lanes and each guy occupies a Lane, while enemies scroll from the right. Let's say an enemy has three armor. He needs to take three hits of any strength to break it, then you can hit his health ONCE, preferably with your heavy hitter. The enemy flies back to the right of the screen, armor is restored but max armor is reduced by one IF you did the exact number of hits. Your three dudes are on an ATB timer, and when one attacks, he can optionally swap lanes with someone as a follow-up.

So you got mobs with varying armor and health in all three lanes. You pause the game and do the math in your head - how to attack and swap in what order to kill or delay. If the enemies get all the way to the left, they hit you. 

Then you get spells, each guy has a starting spell and you get random ones along the way. For example the rogues starting spell gives double hit to any character, so you can do 6, 4, or 2 hits. Do you use it to break armor or to do damage? There are 5 elemental spell types with different interactions. Like using fire on a poisoned guy will make him explode - but if an enemy is poisoned or on fire and makes it to your hero, you take that debuff.

Each hero can wear different gear you find along the way. It's generally smart to ""build"" the two hitter as a spellcaster, and the one- and three- hitters as heavy attackers. There's a wide variety of stuff and the power creep is real.

And of course you have the over world map with branching paths, merchants, chests and keys, etc.

Give it a try if you like roguelikes like slay the spire or monster train.",0

245,gaming,"Now I know this will be personal preference but I believe so many people end up not enjoying a game or outright dropping it, is partly down to following meta builds. 

For one it takes away a sense of discovery. 

For example, let’s say an item in the game buffs your fire damage by 30%. That item though isn’t available for at least the first 10 hours. 

Imagine your doing a fire build on the fly with no knowledge of what items are in the game. 

Now you suddenly discover that item and low and behold it makes a huge difference. That dopamine hit is why we play games. 

I’m currently playing Wonderlands right now and it’s by far the best Borderlands game I’ve ever played. 

The main reason. I just did my build on the fly. I had no clue where to farm certain guns, or what meta class I should I pick. 

In Borderlands 2/3, I followed guides and it just made everything easy. 

I knew if I farmed a boss and got a legendary weapon then I’ll be fine for the next 10 levels.

I was looking for a game that I could play with my high school History students to help illustrate the volatility of the stock market in the late 1920s (not that it's entirely stable now, but we did learn a few things since then).

The game I wanted didn't exist, so I tried to create it. I designed a game called *That's Bananas!*, about monkeys trading fruit. I wanted it to be simple, and I wanted the rules to fit on a single sheet. I'm 

teaching remotely, so I needed something that could be done in a chat. I also designed a spreadsheet to help the kids keep score (though somehow I screwed up one of the calculations and we had to override a column.)

We played it today, and it was \`not great. The game is supposed to be five rounds, and in 75 minutes, we couldn't finish two. Some of it was down to the fact that I'm teaching 16-year-olds remotely, but I feel like there's gotta be something that makes this game hard to understand.

I'm not entirely happy with it, but I'm not sure what to change.

Is anyone interested in giving it a playtest or two and sharing some feedback?

I've attached a jpg of the one pager. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!",0
262,gaming,"Me and my Dad are both huge fans of Halo and we’re talking at dinner last night and had an idea for a new type of game mode that could be implemented into halo infinite. It would be hard but could be done if 343 found a way to do it. It would operate similarly to Battlefront 2’s Supremacy game mode, in which two teams go head to head in order to capture Command Posts and ultimately bringing down capital ships.This would be a 24 vs. 24 type game mode. Our idea would also involve a similar Hero system to Battlefronts, however it would not only involve characters who remain on the ground but also include characters like Cortana, The Shipmaster, or 343 Guilty Spark who act as supportive roles who see the battle from above. They would be in charge of coordinating attacks or defenses at Command Centers and would also be able to create areas for A.I friendliest join the battle, basically an updated version of Halo Wars but with real and A.I players fighting on both sides.

Hero’s

The Hero’s, referred to as reinforcements, would span across the entire franchise, Yes that means Halo Wars characters and Bungie characters along with 343 characters. 

These would include: 

-UNSC reinforcements:

Master chief (Halo CE-Halo Infinite)
Jerome (Halo Wars)
Noble Six (Halo Reach)
Cortana (Halo 2A)

-Covenant reinforcements 

Tartarus (Halo 2A)
The Arbiter: Ripa 'Moramee (Halo Wars)
Hunter (Halo Ce-Halo Infinite)
The Shipmaster: Rtas 'Vadum (Halo 2A)

-Banished reinforcements 

Atriox (Halo Wars 2)
Jega 'Rdomnai (Halo Infinite)
Decimus (Halo Wars 2)
The Shipmaster: Let 'Volir (Halo Wars 2)

-Forerunner/The Created reinforcements

Promethian knight (Halo 4)
Warden Eternal (Halo 5)
343 Guilty Spark (Halo CE-3)

Within this mode there would be a team vote dynamic that would decide what faction your team played as. This would give the game 12 different scenarios (UNSC vs. Covenant, Covenant vs. Banished, Forerunner vs. Banished, ect.)

We also thought of a game mode similar to this but it is an infection game. 24 vs 24 but one side plays as the flood. The goal for the flood as usual is to infect all survivors. The goal for the other faction, which would be decided by the team in a vote, is to survive the flood and destroy the hive.

The Flood reinforcements would include:

Flood Juggernaut (Halo: Fireteam Raven)
Flood Tank Form (Halo 3)
Flood Carrier Form (Halo CE-Halo 3)

This was just a rough draft of something that could bring Halo Infinite back to the spot light, so let me know what you think about the idea and what I should change or add to it.",0

269,gaming,"Hi everybody, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I have to start somewhere. (if it's not allowed, please let me know, not trying to break any rules).

So I've always been very fond of gaming. Been gaming from the age of 14 and always found joy in all kind of genres and styles of games.  Mostly tycoon-like games like FS22, Zoo Planet, Cities Skylines and such but also games like GTA, RDR2, COD and even smaller or more indie-kind of games like Civilization or (even fkn) Splitgate haha. Lately there's been a switch tho...

Since I also started smoking cannabis from when I was 15 yo, I was mostly high when gaming. Since last month I decided to stop smoking cannabis and now I've lost interest in most of the games I played. I can't find joy in any kind of games. It sucks 'cause I really liked gaming and it kinda relieved my mind from stress.

I was wondering of other people also struggled with this and maybe knew any games to play that kind of keeps you going (or something, I really don't know how to express this feeling). Or maybe you guys know how to get back to gaming in a sober world as an ex-cannabis smoker.

Thanks in advance :)",0

293,gaming,"For me, the two things that come to mind are unbalanced characters/weapons etc in multiplayer games, and random encounters in RPGs.

As for balancing, I've found that most of the time the effects of the overpowered thing are usually not that detrimental to overall play, and often times the resulting patches totally overcorrect for it. Often times the ""unbalanced"" abilities actually serve to make the overall game have more dynamism and variety, since they force players to actually change their strategy and ensure a tangible difference between choices that the players make. good example of this is many of the guns in cod4. some guns like the m16, mp5, deagle and m40a3 are objectively better than many of their counterparts, and others, such as the shotguns, lower level SMGs and LMGs are by most metrics worse than the average gun. this combined with the map design actually forces players to switch the guns that they're using depending on the situation, rather than having 30 weapons that all have relatively comparable damage and can be used on every map. 

even though i don't play RPGs very often at all, whenever i do play games such as ff7 and pokemon i never really have a big issue with persistent random encounters. if the combat system is fun enough, i can stomach the grinding.",0

302,gaming,"Hello there, this post isn't about me but my father who is addicted to a certain strategy game that he's been playing for 5 years now.

It gets worse with each year, he doesn't want to hear anything about it because he LOVES the game - just a bit too much.

He's in a huge gaming guild and plays a minimum of 8 hours EVERY DAY! 24/7. (Likely even more since we of course don't know what hes doing at work) I don't live at my parents anymore since I'm 22 now but my mother hates it.

He not only wasts immense amounts doing nothing else but the same shit over and over again, since its a built up genre game and they always do events, essentially the game itself only exists because of people like him, so called Whales, the game has become a fundamental part of his life like he's a cocain addict and he basically has spent up to 10000 dollars on this fucking game.

I'm not kidding he might have even low balled that number, since he gets payed 25k per year (which isnt a lot) but he has like no money saved.

And my mother freaked out and I'm kinda banged over the head too, it also attacks his physical and mental health. Hes just 50 and has signs of Alzheimers already.

A few months ago my mother gave him 3000€ and it was gone after a week....

After a week.

And he can't answer where the money is only makes excuses.

What pisses us off are the strangers he added to whatsapp and seemingly has actual contact with.

They reach from social welfare fatasses, to low wage commoners like him and even business owners. 

And they are all like him: Whales.

One of them, the guild leader is literally the lord of Whales. I don't know about him personally besides that my father told me he's a wealthy man and currently doesnt play as often because he's in hospital for some shit, diabetes or whatever the fuck. As the guild leader he kinda has ingame power over all the other whales so my mother made the theory up that guy is not a millionair but lying and using his guild power to get money out of my dad and others.

And information, it creeped me out to know that some ingame stranger knows about ME and what I do! My father is a blabbering mouth full, so its my problem too now.

The guy has the adresses, names, telephone numbers, alias, family information etc. of supposedly all high ranking members.

He's also max level, which supposedly isn't even possible, even my dad says so once. You essentially have to play the game like around the clock to make max level.

I checked his account out and pi times finger the dude has like 25000 € (26000 $) of special items just standing on his island alone.

It got me thinking hes like a drug lord but dealing with ingame items and power rather than being on the streets dealing crack.

What can we do? Is there any way still possible to stop my dad wasting money or playing his lifetime off by clicking on the same 10 virtual buildings every fucking day???",0

313,gaming,"I've been ruminating over what made my personal experience with Elden Ring so frustrating and oppressive as compared to previous From titles.

Having spent years of my life steeped in the Souls experience, it felt strange being back in a place where I was refusing to engage with the necessary mechanics, genuinely refusing to learn and overcome obstacles as I had done countless times before.


I honestly couldn't understand why I had this reaction. It was like my first time with the series all over again in all the worst ways; As if Elden Ring itself were a sending gate to a time before countless pivotal ""git gud"" moments and I was, once again, gnashing my teeth in confusion and despair.

At first, I assumed I had just gotten old. Life had done it's thing. I no longer had the patience to dedicate my aptitude to such frivolities. But I couldn't work out the specific mechanism by which such a change could have occured.

I'm still relatively young, I thought. In my heart, I still believe that Video Games are the future of high art and the dominant medium for storytelling in the 21st century. Storytelling is an inseparable aspect of the human experience.

Was there really so much different about me, that I could no longer feel driven toward such enviable ends?

No. Or, at least, I genuinely could not believe it to be so.


For weeks, I've wondered about this disturbing feeling of difference that came over me when stepping through a fog wall in the lands between.

What follows is merely what occurs to me, an assuredly incomplete accounting of what may be amiss. 

Dark Souls came at a time when our world and culture were utterly intoxicated; in a post-WWII malaise of nigh-unprecedented peace and order. This allowed a consumer culture to take hold with it's promise of ever-encroaching comfort and pleasure.

Abdication became commonplace as we bowed before the majesty of ease. We'd excised the rich, complicated experience of struggle and, along with it, our capacity to make meaning. The modern world had gone hollow, cold and dark. It's founding flame had faded, resulting in what could most readily be described as atrophy of our very souls.


**I want to briefly qualify this analysis with the following context:** 

People struggle all over the world, every day. There is no shortage of human suffering in the 21st century or any other. What I am talking about is the devaluation of our experience of struggle and it's place in culture.


Souls offered counter-programming, which criticized our complacency with it's very existence. The idea that there was industry-leading design out there, locked behind this experience of hardship that genuinely rewarded antiquated ideals like humility and self discipline was too enticing to ignore.

From found a way to lure a group of people (gamers) who spend most of their lives avoiding the exquisite pain of life's rigors, back into the fray.

Even if purely by chemical means, they brought a lot of us back to a place that humanity had almost forgotten, where through absolute hopelessness, one could finally find freedom.


Here, at what in many ways feels like the end of a journey, we come to Elden Ring. From software calls down another esoteric, relentless deluge upon the masses, only this time we were already soaking wet.

Many have had it worse than me over the past few years. If you're lucky enough to have the time and means to read this ludicrous post, you can probably say the same.

Between the steep decline in quality of human leadership, our long-term prospects as a species that still has a natural habitat and the resurgent prospects of war and pestilence, it feels like the experience of hardship is about to retake it's throne.

Over a decade after From Software bit it's thumb at our rotting culture of ease and comfort, I doubt many of us still feel the warm buzz they sought to dispell.

The experience of hardship that From Software works so hard to realize is no longer refreshing to me, because it is no longer alien.

My time spent galloping through a bloody hell called Caelid at early levels, with no bearing on any notion of progress is something I will forever cherish. Still, the feeling that place engendered in me can no longer be described as a welcome shift in mindset. More often, it stoked something smoldering within my psyche that I'd been trying to smother.


I think this conflict is at the heart of a lot of souls veterans' frustrating experience with Elden Ring. It genuinely feels like we're on the cusp of true struggle the likes of which we've never seen and for which we are ill-prepared. Our blood is up, tempers are short and sometimes it feels like all we can do is sit back wait for shit to get real.

With that kind of apprehension permeating our culture in 2022, the experiential anti-escapism of Elden Ring feels like it's ideologically beating a dead horse.

Today, many of us no longer feel like superheroes in desperate need of a reality check. Instead, you might say we feel tarnished and hollow; our purpose in time being merely to witness and weather some storm a hundred years or more in the making.

I will forgive myself for laying down that burden every once in a while and seeking rest in the games that I play.

I admire this masterpiece and the artists who dedicated years of their lives to making it a reality. They had something to say and where others only whisper, they shouted it from the mountaintops of giants.

It's not their fault that I can no longer stand to listen. Elden Ring may be my last souls game. If it is, it was a hell of a send off. I don't look at it as giving up. I see that once upon a time, I'd forgotten something precious to me. Dark Souls made me remember.

This  is kind of sub related.  I'm looking for a sandbox 3D simulating  building game that could work  as a planning tool for my house, garden  and surrounding area. Nothing  fancy, but I just need to be able to  change the ground levels put up some trees, make a pool, place a custom  formed house and other various  buildings, etc - in first person to be able to  move around and get the general  idea of the design.

Long  time ago,  I know people used Sims to build and come up with ideas of  their own  house. But it isn't first-person and the game is... well old...

Minecraft would be like the perfect game for this, except that the graphics isn't optimal.

I tried using Valheim but it doesn't include a real sandbox environment.

After  googling a bit, I  found a game called Paralives that might be what I'm   looking for, except that it hasn't been released yet.

Instead   of buying expensive simulation applications that are dumb, I rather   invest in a game that can basically do the same thing, with proper  controls and UI.

Any ideas of a game that is or include a sandbox mode with these type of features?",0

360,gaming,"I've never played a game (not even Wasteland) that felt as much like the original two Fallout games as The Weird West feels. This game is so much fun, and gives you freedom to play pretty much however you like. The world map travel with random encounters and discoverable locations is very reminiscent of Fallout, as are the companions you can bring along. The only real gameplay changes are that the combat is real-time action rather than turn based (a very positive change) and the camera is not at a fixed angle but can be rotated 360 degrees. Speaking of the combat, it is just slow enough that you can be tactical, while fast enough that you aren't able to easily outmaneuver every foe. Some of the occult horrors, in particular, are much faster than your human enemies, and completely change the way you approach combat.

Speaking of occult horrors, I am also an aficionado of the pencil and paper game this is based on (also called The Weird West), and the video game keeps the sinister, Lovecraftian horror of the pencil and paper game alive and well in the storytelling.

The reputation system feels similar to Fallout's ""karma"" system, and every character you meet (including key plot characters) can be killed, pickpocketed, or talked to. Many will need help or offer money for your goods or services.

Personally, I think this game is fun as fuck. The first time I shot the dynamite out of an outlaw's hand as he tried to throw it at me and he blew into little bits I laughed out loud. Probably because I'm a bad person. That's not the point. The point is that the designers really made this game open-ended in terms of what actions you can take. Blow open boarded up doors with dynamite? Sure. Shoot an oil lamp to start a fire and trap your enemies? Yes. Turn off that same lamp instead to lure an enemy over so you can choke them out from behind? That, too. Several times I've thought to myself ""I wonder if I can do *this*..."" only to find out that, yes, I can! 

Once, I got caught stealing from a house, so rather than suffer the reputation loss, I murdered the witness. Reputation salvaged. Another time I thought I'd done the same thing, but someone else had seen me just prior to my crimes, and since I was a stranger in those parts, they put 2 and 2 together and my rep took a major hit. Smart gameplay.

Anyway, I wanted to share my experience with you fine people. I'm a few hours in now and just having a grand old time. It's very compelling gameplay with a dark and twisted plot. Looting is fun and rewarding, and unlike most games of this sort, the consumables are in constant use because of how plentiful and powerful they are. For anyone with game pass like me, it's on there which is why I checked it out in the first place. Have fun!",0

I love this game and I'm so glad it was on sale on the PS store for $5. I just find the world of Prototype to be very empowered me. Alex Mercer inspired me to feel empowered and I love Prototype for that reason. Even after you played the game, you still feel powerful.

He's a very lonely guy and I like how the game conveys his loneliness considering he is the Blacklight Virus and he can't be around anyone without being a complete danger to them. He's extremely powerful and a badass on his own though, and that is what makes him empowering for me. He doesn't need to rely on anyone and he's a total powerhouse.

It may not be on the top ten games of all-time. But the impact of the overall experience is still ahead of its time in my opinion. Love this game and Alex Mercer's character.",0

422,gaming,"Honestly, when I saw Exoprimal during the showcase, I was a bit excited. I initially thought it had to do with Pragmata since the set looked the same, albeit brighter, but I wasnt overly disappointed...until I found out what type of game it was after.

Typically, multiplayer or coop games in general are not my thing. Im not adverse to playing them, but when it comes down to a decision for what Im going to be spending my time and money on, multiplayer centric games are usually not at the top of the list, let alone a 5v5v1, which Ive kinda always thought was a weird genre.

Regardless though, the game looked cool. I was drawn in because it looked like it has a lot of potential. Its got the awesome personalized mech, Anthem style designs, the trailer gameplay looked like it had almost Monster Hunter-esque heavy, yet swift combat, and quite frankly I think I and everyone else could see remnants of the assets from the canceled Dino Crisis game (articles stated back in 2020) from the red headed character to the updated dinosaur looks. From all cylinders it looks legitimately fun.

However, my issue with it stems not from my usual avoiding multiplayer games, because I do still play some from time to time if I really enjoy them, or they catch my eye, but from Capcoms spotty history with online centric titles. Capcom doesnt have the best record with support for these kinds of things unless your names are Street Fighter or Monster Hunter, and even then those two franchises have strong single player cores at heart, while this is promisingly to be solely requiring more than one person. Even Capcoms own Resident Evil franchise, another heavy hitter of theirs, hasnt faired too well with online, its latest tragedies being RE: Verse which still hasnt seen the light of day despite having a couple of betas and supposed to be released during launch day of RE8, and Resistance pretty much dying within weeks of its release.

Given that it makes it hard to get excited for a potentially online only title that could vanish just as quickly as it came if the fan reception isnt there day one, but also since Capcom still isnt as experienced in making multiplayer only games that are success' it makes it hard to want to get too invested. Maybe it if did with what Monster Hunter does it gave it scaling difficulty, or a solo (and I mean solo without bots) as a separate mode an option I could see this fairing better.

454,gaming,"Hello Reddit!

Small disclaimer: Englisch is not my native language so apologies for mistakes in advance!

I used to be a big fan of MMORPGs an for the most parts I still am. Basically I played a lot of years WoW aswell as FFXIV. I also basically play genshin impact since release and recently started to play Lost ark just to see if I like it. Lost ark is really a nice game that cought my attention now on to the personal problem I have. I think I really have a tendency to wanting to spend irl money on those games and while I know this itself is not a problem of you don't overdo it, it still bothers me a bit. 

I have spend some money on genshin (now I know I am not even considered a whale but I play the game for around 1.5 years and have spend maybe 300 euro plus the monthly subscription, give or take some bucks). I don't regret spending the money since I really enjoyed the excitement I had from getting a nice drop or my bf beeing happy for me when I got a husbando there but the constant possibility of spending more money to get something always pops up in my head. 

I got this feeling lately with Lost ark too since there is this cute cat pet with a crown in the auction house that's not available anywhere else and I was calculating how expensive would be to buy it. I earn good money so I. Theory that's not the problem bit it started to bother me that those thoughts keep popping up in my head especially when things like this are constantly available for me. I did some quest and kept thinking about the store and the pet and stuff like this it just made me enjoy the game a lot less cause my mind was wandering. Then FOMO started aswell in between cause who knows maybe this cat will never be available again in the store. I just felt so tired by it eventho I liked the genre itself so much it tired and exhausted me.
Please I am not hating on any game mechanics or on the existence  of the stores I know a lot of people are totally fine with that. It's just a personal problem I have lately and I was curious if someone else experienced the same and found a solution for this.

Or is there any MMORPGs where you just have to buy the game one time and then you can play it without any microtransactions? I saw a bit of new world but it didn't had any cute pets or mounts so I thought that's not fitting and o have no clue if new age would have microtransactions in the game as well. Maybe anyone has an idea or even just other points of views or experiences are appreciated :)

I am talking about games that have experiences that modern gamer would not want to miss. So no nostalgia glasses here.

My picks:

Super Mario World: One of the best platformers ever released. Great, colorful graphics. Great music and tight controls. Except for the low resolution it just feels modern in so many ways. So much creativity in the levels, and the game is very forgiving.

Doom: Preferably with one of the mods that upgrade the resolution/graphics and adds mouse look. Fast, arcadey gameplay with interesting monsters and some abstract level design that you don't see anymore. This one is also very easy to pick up and play.

F-Zero GX: The difficulty might not be for everybody, but you don't have to play story mode. This game has some wonderful 60fps fast paced racing with really precise controls. The game never got any sequels, because it was already perfect.

Baldur's Gate 2: Maybe the least accessible on this list, as it feels pretty old school and almost requires some knowledge about the D&amp;D 2nd edition ruleset. Played the enhanced edition is prefered, because of some much needed QoL improvements. What is so special about this game is that it was made before roleplaying games really got steamlined.

Games are expensive nowadays and we all have old/unplayed games sat in our library that we wasted money on. Any DLCs bought would also be added to the value of the game when trading it in.

I have fought this for over a week with no results. I’ve tried every thing I can find on the internet and YouTube. All my devices will connect to my extender but my PS4 will not. It will connect to my router that is one room away but not to the extender that is in the same room as my PS4.

613,PS4,"I've had my ps4 for about 6 years now and it hasn't run into any major problems until now. About a year ago I was playing when suddenly the ps4 ejected the disc by itself. I shrug it off as just a weird thing that happened except it kept ejecting discs for no reason. So I watched a video which told me to take the rubber foot off the bottom, which I did. This solved the problem immediately and I thought that was that. However my ps4 also started experiencing another problem which was shutting down randomly. It would beep randomly, and then the ps4 just shut off completely as if someone pulled the plug. I know it isn't overheating because just yesterday I was literally on the home menu not even doing anything when it just shut off randomly. And to make it worse my ps4 is now randomly ejecting discs again. Again, I know it's not overheating because it just does it when I'm not even doing anything, and I clean my ps4 quite regularly sooooo yea.

615,PS4,"I think after years of going the digital route, the physical discs and cases have created this sorta nostalgic feeling to gaming for me. It rekindles this love that I’ve always had as a kid but somewhere along my path of growing up it was suppressed by family and friends. I still played video games but felt weird about expressing how I felt about the story of certain games, their characters and the world created in them. Now for some reason at the age of 30 I have finally gotten over that (maybe subconscious I’m not sure) thought/feeling of, “I shouldn’t love video games that way and stop being lazy” feeling and have fully embraced my love for them.

I’ve expressed this before to a few people and their reply was, “It’s probably because of its now popularity of the gaming community.” Which of course that could definitely be it but maybe because of the now popularity, I now have this feeling like I’m part of a community and I’m not alone in my love for video games on a much bigger scale. I certainly didn’t have that feeling growing up but it’s nice to have it now as I play with random strangers and we strike up a friendship and express together the love we have over the same things. 

This was just a random thought that I had as I was typing this in a reply to another post/comment. So I felt like sharing this epiphany that just occurred with me.

619,PS4,"Casual gamer here (I’ve used Logitech game-pads on the PC). I’ve seen reviews of the controller on PS5.(has been impossible to get one in India). Definitely looks and feels next-gen. But I have some qualms with controller on PS4.

I might be over-scrupulous here, but..

1. It’s plastic-ky and feels poorly built. I hate that there is not much of a heft to it. Doesn’t feel solid in the hands. Sony could have used some higher quality plastic along with rubber grips under-neath and for the sticks.

2. Buttons are mushy. I love how the Macbook trackpad clicks. The buttons could also be pressure sensitive (something like 3D Touch?)

3. R3 and L3 sticks can be made pressure sensitive or adaptive. Like when you are pulling a lever in Uncharted or GOW, the sticks can offer more resistance as you are completing the pull.

4. The touch pad can be put on the back of the controller so that it can accessed by the ring finger?

Coming to the title, I’m a huge Apple fanboy and I wonder what innovation could Apple bring to a game pad?

622,PS4,"**TL;DR** \- RemotePlay helped finally fit the PS4 into my life. Despite some baffling decisions or oversight, the graphical prowess and continued support for the platform is encouraging. If Sony could just do better with it's RemotePlay support, I would be ecstatic.

**Question:** What do you consider to be knockout features?  

\----------------------------------------------------

Being that I'm mostly on the go, I never seem to be able to find the time to actually be in one place long enough to game and make what I feel is significant progress - especially since I'm a fan of JRPGs or games that have RPG elements to them. It's why I've always leaned towards portables such as the 3DS, Vita and the Switch. 

**So why the PS4 now?**

Well, I've been a big fan of the Persona series. I've played Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden multiple times. I've also been able to distract myself when Persona 5 came out and also had some wishful thinking of it appearing on Switch. However, with Persona 5 Royal having been released and Persona 5 Strikers - the sequel to Persona 5 already out. It appears to me that the writing has been on the wall long enough to tell me that the mainline game won't be making an appearance. Especially since the previous entries never did.  

**But what about portability?** 

It didn't occur to me until a few weeks ago what Remote Play was really about, and that is the ability to play on a VITA, smartphone, or tablet on the go - so long as there is a WiFi/data connection. When that became apparent, the other shoe dropped. It was like a watershed moment. It was shortly after that a PS4 had found a new home. 

**What are your thoughts?**

It's been a week since I've owned the PS4. Here's some first impressions.

First the good stuff:

* I can't believe I didn't know about RemotePlay sooner! Being able to access the library on the go is a game-changer
* What a rich library of games! I feel like I'm in a fortunate position where there are so many quality games that have had enough time pass so that they can be bought at a fraction of the original price. In my eyes, that is a bargain. 
* I'm excited to experience the PS4's graphical prowess on the go. Beyond having it work on my phone and tablet, I've gotten it to work on the Chromecast too!
* I'm really happy to see that there are still new titles coming to the platform this year
* Being able to use this as a media center is pretty nifty - though I have yet to dive into it.
* The PSN Store UI is pretty nice

Room for Improvement

* The Settings menu needs a revamp somehow. Perhaps maybe it can learn through my usage of what settings I frequently toggle. (ex: connecting/disconnecting my controller since I use it on the go)
* Why no Bluetooth audio support?
* RemotePlay is amazing - when it works. I live in a major city and take a bus to work. There are several moments where there are just dropped connections. Is this a compression issue or something?
* Can Sony please come up with a compact controller on the go or some kind of more pocket-friendly peripheral? You can't necessarily slide the controller into your pants pocket.",1

I didnt have the recipt bc I'm a dumbass and got rid of it asap so I counted it as a loss and went on with using the drifting controller for a few months, I had little ways of fixing it (turning it upside down and giving the sticks a wiggle, using a pin to clear out debris) and it was useable for the most part. Well yesterday I decided I was sick of the drift and decided to transfer over the battery from the drifty one to the new one in hopes that I could use it again. Long story short it worked, I turned it on, no drift no problems, basically a brand new controller. 5 mins later I took it home (fixed it at my parents bc they have the tools I need) and when I got home the controller didnt turn on. Again. I couldn't plug it in, I couldn't press the reset, nothing worked. Now I have no controllers that work and I'm very frustrated that my ps4 controller is frying all my batteries.

At the moment I don't really have a list of games I want to play so I was wondering why not get into HZD again before I get to play HFW. That way the story will be fresh in my mind.

However, a thing about open world games like HZD is that halfway through the game the gameplay becomes boring and exhausting. I don't want to finish HZD and then jump straight into HFW and experinece similar gameplay for another 60 or so hours.

So my question is, should I finish HZD again before leading up to HFW or skip HZD, read the synopsis of the original game, and go into HFW fresh?",1

654,PS4,"So basically everytime I change the option to ultra low latency, after going live and I check the settings again, it's back on normal latency, which is really bad and I am unable to change the settings while the game is being broadcast.

Anyway to fix the issue? Is the PS4 not allowed to play in ultra low latency on YouTube Livestream?",1
655,PS4,I’m not sure how to frame this or if it’s ever happened to anyone else. I got a notice on my PlayStation saying that I was permanently banned from the network for violating community rules. I couldn’t log on I was blocked. I found the error code and it regarded chargebacks and the reversal of charges for bundle purchases I’d made. I checked with my financial institution that I used and they said all the payments were processed for the purchases and weren’t charged back. I emailed PlayStation Network and explained this. They send a email basically reiterating that I charged back the purchases and gave me a balance I had to pay. I had to purchase PlayStation store credits from a store and enter the codes. I buy a card for more than the amount owed by $5.00. Later I received an email from them saying the card had insufficient funds to lift the ban and gives me another balance to pay that was $6.00 less than the original balance owed. Next time I buy a $50.00 card submit the code. After about 6 hours or so I received another email explaining the ban had been lifted. So after paying $75.00 on a $50.00 charge the ban was lifted but the strange part is I check my transactions made and only the bundle purchases and the $25.00 card store cash payment are shown in transactions and not the other $50.00 card I purchased. Nor was there any balance for overpayment. Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else on the PlayStation Network?,1

After a few months, this thread is now becoming bi-weekly, as a way to make questions less scattered over threads.

As a reminder, the following threads are no longer allowed on [r/PS4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/) and will be removed:

* **Tech Support questions** (""I have a problem"", ""My controller doesn't work"", ""I can't connect to PSN""...)
* **Game recommendation** (""Which game should I get?"", ""Is this game good?"")
* **General questions** (""Where can I get a PS4?"", ""What do you think of this controller?"")

**Those questions now have to be asked in this thread**. It will be renewed at 12:00 PM EST on Mondays and Fridays.

This thread is sorted by **New answers by default**. Sorting it by Top or Best could give answers to commonly answered questions.

664,PS4,"If you’re not aware of the most recent controversy Polyphony studios has been embroiled in, update 1.07 for GT essentially broke the game. 

They lowered your in game credits per race  by an average of 33% in order to “more closely align the prices of in-game cars to their real-life counter parts. 

This essentially means they don’t want people to grind for cars but they want them to spend actual money on virtual goods held on a server that will be shut down eventually. 

I requested a refund and got rejected but I’m going to keep requesting. I hope people here too will too.

Remember what happened with battlefield 2042? If enough people request refunds for a game they’ve already downloaded it may sway them to allow refunds in order to quell public dissent. Micro transactions are a scam.",1

Once I was able to get over the morality of the issue, is there some 3D printer gizmo that I can put on my controller to ensure this happened perfectly?  Or even some type of guide like the dudes from the shooting game tape up their screen?  I'd like to pull off a magical round just because.

Nothing helped, does anybody know any other solution which might not involve disassembling the whole console?

please tell me if any one knows way to set for example (actually this is exact my desired scenario) forward stick movement under L3?

You know, like arrows to move but under R3? AND to be more complicated, arrows per se arent responsible for movement, only analog sticks.

PS: i highly dont want to use any strikepack or other hardware modifiers if possible.

Edit: for downvoters - it is not for antirecoil macrose or something everyone hate.
In apex legends tap strafe is a thing on PCs, but impossible to do on regullar controller becouse you need use forward move button midair when redirecting with left stick to side, which is impossible due to how stick works.

Since when was there a shortage of ps4 controllers and why :/


Really sucks having to deal with stick drift every 2 months past- not having the means to fix it so having to buy new ones- only to find there aren’t any.. 

The store clerk said they’d not had any shipments of them since mid 2021.

Blows my mind that they’re in shortage seeing as there’s the new console and controller- what, did people give up the ps5 wait and get ps4s??

Hate to rant but I think some of Sonys products are just a waste of money. I’ve paid around 400$ for the console, probably the same amount again for the many controllers that end up unusable after a couple months.. When I say unusable I mean it, it feels like playing with Tourette’s- your camera jerking and sliding everywhere with the slightest touch.

808,PS4,"I was getting a lot of fan noise under heavy load in some games so I took the cover off completely to see if it helped and the fan was quiet. So I cut a hole in the cover and cut up a drink holder I found for about $4 at Walmart to act like a nice finishing touch.

Edit/update:
After reviewing the comments I see that people think the air being drawn across the plastic surfaces inside of the console is additional cooling on the intake side. I have searched articles to see if this is true and I am unable to find any proof that improving the intake amount by allowing the fan to directly intake air is harmful. 

Secondly on the idea that this will increase dust into the inner workings. I have to disagree as there are no filters between the fan and the OEM intake ports. In essence this will improve the ability for me to see that the fan is dusty if it gets dusty at all and clean it. 

Third I have replaced all thermal paste and was doing this mod for a bit of fun and for improved airflow yes it’s quieter now because the fan doesn’t have to work as hard to get colder external air into the intake. If at any point it becomes worse “ I don’t see how” I will replace the cover with an original. 

After reviewing google images for “PS4 Fan mod” I’m pretty surprised you guys are appalled by my mod when there are a ton of even worse things out there. Remember kids, its my console that I own.

I love the Horizon games, especially the way they’ve designed the land to mirror our world. In fact one of my favorite things to do as I explore is figure out where Aloy would be today. I was particularly excited about the Zion National Park relic early in the game. 

One thing that’s been bothering me though is the plant life in HFW. Plainsong should be in Eastern Nevada right? Then why is there a bunch of monstera and other tropical plants? 

I haven’t reached the coast yet but from promo material, I know it’s also tropical in-game which isn’t accurate. 

Maybe there’s an in-game explanation but if so I haven’t reached it yet. 

I know it’s dumb and as I play I’m enjoying the game for what it is. Just something I’ve noticed.",1

But since I can't cash in that leftover money on my wallet and the games are on sale, I decided to finally get one of them.

825,PS4,"Huge and beautiful open world which once again feels empty, with bland, unrewarding and unsatisfying sidequests, errands and characters. Locations of interest and dungeons are starting to become repetitive, and as a completionist this is extremely frustrating because I like to check every question mark available. Combat is the same as before with machines being overly aggressive, which makes combat a rolling/concentration fest that in the end becomes repetitive and unsatisfying. Spear combat has improved for sure, but I rarely use it when fighting machines unless I go for critical hits. 

This is one of the reasons I try to avoid combat in Horizon whenever possible. Bandit camps are also suffering from past game’s direction, stealth in this game is never as satisfying as in other games like Arkham Knight or even any Assassin’s Creed. I just don’t see Aloy terrorizing bandits, this is something that always feels wrong with her personality/character. Wish she had some other tools to do stealth combat, like a special dagger she can only use in those circumstances. 

The game is gorgeous and much improved over HZD but I can’t believe I’m having more sense of wonder and general satisfaction in Elden Ring which I think is a much simpler game.

Edit: Sorry for my bad descriptions of combat, I don’t find combat hard at all I just find it annoying/repetitive because I have to resort to the same strategy with every type of machine so far, which is ropecasting, find weakpoints/weaknesses and concentration away.

Edit2: Just completed first cauldron after 16 hours. They haven’t changed anything from HZD on these, same endless climbing and very little reward at the end. Incredibly unsatisfying and tedious.",1

What we have gotten so far, they have cut off ability to use Russian PS store, which affecting us, and let's be honest sanctions are hitting us (Latvia) harder than Russia. 

Support is rejecting our requests to change regions on accounts, so we are technically f\*\*ked over by them. As it seems that their specialists couldn't come up with anything better, like blocking off people by the actual IP geo (as it seems it requires some skills and proper mindset), and they have just suspended whole store based on the region instead. 

I am worried to use their services as well in the future, as now it is Russia and later it may be us or anybody else by that logic.

Chances are you have one too at home somewhere and its atleast worth a try. It didnt work for the screws inside the ps4 to access the motherboard or even the cooling fan grill for example,but the fan itself will be accessable and its enough to clean it alone.And if you have either a ps4 slim or pro, then you really have no excuse not to clean your fan,you can just pop off your console cover, no screwdriver needed.

I don't ever plan on playing the game online, can I just cancel and delete this update? Or does it have some important content related to the single player campaign?

920,PS4,"I had my doubts about this, my PS4 is 7 years old is an original model and this thing ran like a jet engine no matter what game, even lower demand games like Doom (1993) were causing it to get loud.

For years now I have ensured that the fan and heat sink were always clear of dust that has always silenced the fan, but recently that stopped making much difference.

So I purchased what I thought was I guess quality thermal paste and took an hour or two to disassemble and apply it, and after reassembly I and stunned at how quiet this thing is now. 

Suffice it to say the old thermal paste was dried up and hard like clay which was likely the root cause of it being loud, but this is even quieter than it was stock if I remember correctly.

Even high demand games like Black ops 3 and Modern Warfare 2019 can barely get the fan to rev up before it quickly quietens it down.

927,PS4,"The Horizon series have simply gone from strength to strength, in my humble opinion.

I absolutely fell in love with the first title when it came out; a truly huge, lush, epic, and beautiful world filled with varied biomes, weather, real world animals, and AMAZING machine animals. 

A high concept apocalyptic science fiction plot / story that I thought succeeded brilliantly. 

Such a unique and cool concept. 

Amazing and varied combat mechanics, allowing one to plan and enjoy combat encounters in a wide variety of ways, even if all you choose to do is batter and stab everything to death with your club. 

Excellently and realistically written characters with superb and emotional voice acting (respect to Ashley Burch and good on her for all the awards she is winning for her portrayal of Aloy, what a talented person, from Tiny Tina to Aloy, what range!).  

Stunning world building packed full of interesting sights to see and amazing lore to peruse through in the form of datapoints.

I don’t want to drop any spoilers for the plot of the second game (I’m about 2/3s of the way through the main story, exploring the whole map and doing side activities right  now), but it adds to and improved upon the story from the first one in many awesome ways. 

I won’t deny, the game IS a bit of a grind collecting money and parts for weapon purchasing and upgrading, but the grind is fun if you want to do it, and the starter weapons can see you through the whole game if you don’t. 

They have greatly reduced the number of traps you can have out now, but I think that’s good for the balance of the game, as they were ridiculously OP in the first one, just being able to lay down a murder field of 20 or more traps. I do miss the whistle, as rocks are NOT as effective in terms of luring enemies.

This game is honestly an absolute treasure, a real gem. Directly before it, I had played, from release, Dying Light 2. It was a good game, with a lovely environment, decent story, cool enemies, and interesting combat mechanics (even if they weren’t up to the level of the first game) but the game was an absolute insane buggy glitchy mess. The first game I have ever straight up abandoned due to glitches. Two separate story mission trophies not popping was the last straw for me. 

So it was an incredible relief going from that hot mess to Horizon Forbidden West, in which I have had ZERO glitches in my 70 plus hours of playtime since release.

Throw on some chill tunes and just get lost in exploring and gathering and fighting (or not!) your way around the incredibly varied map; soaring, icy, mountain peaks, vast, parched, rocky, deserts, swampy, cold, ominous, wetlands, humid, impenetrable, lush, jungles, icy, desolate, snowy, wastes, and the beautiful temperate rainforests and beaches of the west coast (which fill me with such beautiful nostalgia for my childhood summers wandering the beaches of Vancouver Island with my grandparents and other family). It soothes your soul and provides a truly rich and interesting and immersive gaming experience.

As a gamer whose favourite genre is open world, and as a lifelong science fiction fan, this is as good as gaming gets for me, and I am loving every second of it.

From the bottom of my heart, Guerilla Games, thank you so much for this wonderful treasure of a gaming experience!

I have been going through rough times emotionally as of late and this game has been a tremendous salve for my troubled mind and soul!",1
928,PS4,"To preface this I have a CECHYA-0080 headset for the ps3 and upon buying a ps3 earpiece a cechya-0082 dongle was included.

Now my question and hopefully someone can give me some proper insight into this as I might just be over-thinking things but if these headsets work on the 2.4ghz bluetooth band why does the 0082 dongle refuse to pair with the 0080 ps3 headset?

Is it because of the additional custom eq option (off-1-2 switch) found on the ps4 headset? Or is it purely hardware based via Sony?

Will the 0082 dongle work with all the ps4 headsets and the 0081 dongle with all the ps3 headsets?

Would something like one of those Bluetooth 5.0 generic dongles pair with it?",1

974,PS4,"I've been playing Elden Ring on my PS4 Pro, but the load times were killing me. And I'm still bad at the game which means I die &amp; reload a ton.

So I got a solid state drive last night. After hooking it up, I was blown away by how well it worked. YouTube videos say that you can expect about a 30% reduction in load times but for me it was reducing load times by 50%, getting them down to around **10 seconds** on average.

For me, this difference feels enormous. Ten seconds flies by whereas the original load times (20 seconds or more) made me fidgety.

It was also way easier than I expected to set it up as an external drive and transfer the game's files. ([This video](https://youtu.be/ypQTC6Rt0jk?t=366) has instructions. It takes about 10 minutes.) I know you can get an additional boost if you mount the SSD internally, but [when Digital Foundry compared the difference](https://youtu.be/E07IM_bArGQ?t=500) it wasn't as big as I expected.

YMMV if you have a base PS4. Using an external drive should give you a similar boost, I think. But you might actually see smaller gains if you replaced your internal hard drive, because the base PS4 has a different storage standard (SATA2 vs SATA3).

For anyone curious, the drive I'm using is a Samsung 870 QVO 1TB plugged into a UGreen 2.5"" USB 3.1 hard drive enclosure. Together they cost about $130, which is cheaper than a PS5 and a helluva lot easier to find.

I figured I'd share my results in case anyone else is in a similar situation and wondering what the real-world impact of an SSD will be.

TL;DR: Hooking up an external SSD can cut your Elden Ring load times in half and it's crazy easy to set up.",1

984,PS4,"This is ridiculous, that on my PS4 (probably all PS including PS5) I cannot change the region once I set it for my account. I moved from one country to an other and I can't use the main account if I want to buy something because the stores reagion locked. That is understandable, everyone doing it for various legal reasons.  
But not letting people change the reagion of the main account once it's set is just outrageous, while every other platform lets you do that, without any fuss or inconveniance.

Why Sony can't do this? I tell you why. Sony is living in the past and they don't listen to their custommers.   
It is really sad, they really think that people in these days are tied to one place for their whole life and won't move from one country to an other.  
That's not the case Sony! People these days are alowed to meve between countries. Not just alowed, but many of us will.  
There are multiple reasons why people would move from country to country, one is because they have to. Either because of work or other reasons. Or get this Sony, because they can.

After realising I can't change my region that I originally set on my account (which i couldn't beleive) I reached out to Sony through custommer support, to ask what's going on and what's the solution.  
Their solution was: Create a new account which is set to that new country where I moved and use that account.

I was shocked, that this was their answere. They want me to not use my main account where I have my games and friends, trophies and so on, but use a new account just because they are not willing to give us this simple option?! For that I say screw that Sony!

Since I found out that I can use my original ""main account"" still while I buy things on a new account set as the main account.  
This is not a solution, this is an uggly, shitty patch on the underling problem.  
\* First, because I moved to a German speaking country, the ps store (and deper settings menus) are in German that I can't change and my German language skills aren't good as I don't really need it for my work.  
\* Second, If I buy ingame something on this ""shopping account"" that's really just a russian rulette if I can use that content on my original account or not. Recently I bought the season pass for Controll and I'm unable to play that content on my original account.

Oh and if someone have to move from country to country constantly because their job requires them, they just have to create an infinate amount of accounts just to be able to buy games and content?  
This is ridiculous. Basically Sony with their shitty policies basically saying screw you to these people.

This is not just cumbersom to juggle around these accounts, but anoying and many times it doesn't even work as intended.  
I really like the consol itself, I really like the exclusive games or just plaing on the Playstation, but having to deal with this kind of shit, is just frustrating. 

I refuse to beleave that sony such a huge company is not capable of adding a simple feature where you can change your region/location for your account.  
Yes I'm avare that on the PS5 you can switch between stores and in some cases actually buy content, but in many cases it doesn't work and it's not a solution.

I want to have one account where I can choose my location so I can access the store of that country I moved to and buy content there, and not having to deal with the other bullshit, which is the language.  
If I can set the language of the account, I want that language throughout evry single submenu and the PS store.

I'm not asking for free money, these are simple things that should have been implemented years ago.  
It's ridiculous that I want to spend money and I can't even do that.

I really hope Sony will do something about this. Because they will loose customers because their stubborn outdated thinking.",1

1006,pokemon,"I want new Dunspace you want new Dunspace lets get moving 

OK first of all we need to make it a Pokemon related  to the Iberian Peninsula preferably a dragon. Despite me knowing basically nothing about either of the countries I was able to find some thing that wasn’t a windmill. It’s probably a much worse idea though. The wyvern of the House of Braganza and more importantly for this post  the Sceptre of the Dragon is the best Potential Evolution bases that I was able to find. With the Wyvern‘s limbs being the same as dunsparce even though the legs are placed differently. I bring up the scepter though in particular because we’re making it a gold dragon. Partially because of its relationship with caves but mostly because it gold is what associated the most of the New World explorations. I mean they literally saw a man who babes himself in gold said that’s not enough gold and  made up a city that’s entirely gold. And That’s how we have most South America maps . There’s even gold in the trailer for the games right before the game play. I will be genuinely shocked if they don’t have a gold Pokémon. And It’s not uncommon for dragons to be associate with gold even in the series so a golden dragon doesn’t seem to out of left field.

Next let’s go over the design for the new sparce. The head remains mostly the same but it has a drill for a tongue that constantly sticking out, some sharp teeth, and a tiny crown on it head. It gained dragon legs lower on his body And dragon wings that are basically in the same place as the originals right next to it head.  its body elongates to 3 meter cause base Dunspace is already upsettingly large might as well just double it. Finally the yellow on it body is brighten to the same hue as Ho-Oh’s tail.

 Ingame lore just cause. in this region dunsparce was confused for being a gold Pokémon do to there extremely sparse appearances their coloration and only being found within caves. This caused them to be extremely popular with the nobility especially in western parts of the region. even being used as the perch for the royal crown and jewelry. eventually all this exposure to gold awaken the ancient dragon lineage within dunsparce and turned it into gold . After evolving they’ll often become guard dogs of sorts for their owners Wealth. Sometimes guarding the huge rooms filled to the brim with gold with there own lives. It becomes steel dragon and evolves via Learning dragon crown.

Finally let’s see how to turn our boi in to a competitive monster.  Its abilities could stay the same but let’s just give it Levitate to replace runaway . I’m simply adding iron head and a dragon type variant called dragons crowned to its move pool because it is pretty good as is. boost its speed to 100 And it attack to 110 and you have a genuine menace to society. It’s defenses can stay the same . 

Hopefully this Gen is when we get the sparce evo that we all wanted for so long. Is my weird idea likely to come to pass not even remotely. But if it does I would like to say my father’s brother’s nephew’s Cousin’s former roommate works for Gamefreak.",2

Like, maybe it's not oversaturated in Dark and Ghosts, but I feel like Fighting-type has become a bit too much of an easy fix to make a strong starter with little investment.

I bring this up mostly due to the theories that Quaxly is going to be Water/Fighting. No! Enough of that. People can't complain about Sprigatito staying on four legs and then swarm onto making another starter a Fighting-type.

Make Quaxly Rock or Flying type. Make its secondary type Fire, even! Make Sprigatito Steel or Poison! Have Fuecoco learn Earthquake or Hurricane or Blizzard. Just enough with just having Fighting-type starters!

Bad enough that ""Meteor Assault"" a Fighting-type attack just to justify making the Galarian Farfetch'd line Fighting-type, when even the Japanese name ""Star Assult"" suggests a Fairy, Steel, or Rock-type attack. Don't need another Fighting bird so soon.

**WARNING: LONG**

I've seen this discussion multiply times. Real animals have been seen in Pokemon, not just the anime, but the games as well.

This raise a question. What is the difference between a Pokemon and an animal? Why can't a cow, tiger or elephant be trained and used in a Pokemon battle?

Unfortunately, nobody has given an answer I can accept. So I'm going to explore the issue myself, and come up with a theory, that (hopefully) makes sense.

**Disclaimer:** I'll be using the anime as my main source for this theory, but I will include the games and other media as well. Contrary to popular belief, animals are NOT an anime exclusive thing, and do appear in the games. Also, I will ONLY be using the original Japanese dub. Animals mentioned only in the English dub (like lions and reindeer) will NOT be include in this theory.

Also, I will be looking at things from a Watsonian view point rather then a Doylist one

Debunking a few theories

Like I said, I have seen people try to answer this question many times. Unfortunately, these theories don't make sense, or at least not for every species. I mean, a goldfish is different to a mongoose which is different to an elephant. As such, no ""one size fits all"" explanation will do.

One popular explanation is: ""**Animals don't have moves**"". This comes from the Zygarde cell and core, which explains that they are not Pokemon because they lack moves. This explanation works for things like goldfish and insects, as they are small and can't do much in a fight. But what about an elephant or a tiger? They have plenty of moves (albeit normal type) that would be affective in a Pokemon battle.

As I said before, a ""one size fits all"" theory just wont work.

Another explanation is: ""**Animals are weak, and not as invulnerable to things like electricity and fire, and would therefore DIE if used in a Pokemon battle**"". I'm afraid that doesn't work eaither. I mean, there is one animal that appears in every Pokemon media to date that shows the same level of toughness Pokemon have. That animal is of course humans.

Humans in the Pokemon world are shown to have high resistance to thing that would kill, cripple or disfigure a person in real life. The amount of times Ash has been electrocuted or burned is too many to list, as well has Team Rockets ""blasting off again"" only to be safe and sound for the nest episode. Now you could say ""**Oh, this is just slapstick humour for comedic affect**"". It still doesn't change the fact that it happens. Slapstick comedy or not, humans in the Pokemon world show clear invulnerability to Pokemon attacks. So there is no reason why a non-human animal wouldn't have this same kind of protection.

Still not convinced? Raichu's Pokedex entry says

&gt;Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint.

The key word here being **FAINT**, not **DIE**.

My theory

I looked at this list of animals and I noticed a pattern.

[Animals in the Pokémon world - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia (bulbagarden.net)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Animals_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world)

We can group animals into three different catagories: **Confirmed animals** (animals we know for a fact exist in the Pokemon world), **Cryptic animals** (ones that are heavily implied to exist, but not confirmed) and **Implied animals** (animals that are only reference vaguely)

**Confirmed Animals:**

* Fish
* Insects
* Worms
* Crustaceans
* Clams and Oysters
* Coral
* Varies lesser sea invertebrates (starfish, sea anemones ect)
* Frogs (one appears on Oddish's Trading Card)
* Small birds (one appears on Weepinbells Trading Card, they are also, in the Anime they are heard in the background sometimes)

**Cryptic Animals** (explanations in brackets)

* Mice (get mentioned way too many times to be a passing reference. Also, the Gastly from ""The Ghost of Maidan's Peak"" once turned into a giant mousetrap)
* Cats (again, get mentioned an awful lot. Even Catnip is mentioned)
* Mongoose (The Maidan's Peak Gastly turns into one to scare Ekens, showing both these Pokemon at least know what a mongoose is)
* Cows (beef appears, although it could come from anywhere. Also Ash once dressed up in a cow costume, showing he, Misty and the people who made the costume know what a cow is)
* Chicken (get mentioned a lot. Also, cooked chicken appears, but this could be anything)
* Deer (what looks like a deer head can be seen in ""The Tower of Terror"" but it's not acknowledged or detailed, so it could be anything)
* Tigers (a picture of one is seen in ""Riddle Me This"")
* Swans (Meowth wears a rubber swan in ""The Misty Mermaid"")
* Seagulls (Miranda from the first movie apparently talks to them, though they are not seen)
* Elephants (get mentioned in Raichu and Gastly's Pokedex entries)
* Chameleons (Lickitung's entry)
* Whale (a whale-like creature that appears in the Manga ""The Electric Tale of Pikachu"")
* Turkey (Snorlax eats a frozen turkey in one of Pokemon Newspaper Strips)

**Implied Animals** (explanations in brackets)

* Rabbits (rabbits are not named, but appear as plushies and as pictures)
* Bears (same matter as rabbits)
* Owls (One Bird Keeper says ""I go everywhere with my Noctowl. We’re gonna show you **owl** best! Ha!"")
* Polecats (Somebody calls Team Rocket polecats in one episode)
* Ducks, Horses and Giraffes (appears as toys in ""Tower of Terror"")
* Chipmunks (Get mentioned in one episode)
* Basically, ever animal I haven't mention that is a Pokemon category, like Turtles, foxes ect.

What does this mean?

With this list, you will notice a few things.

All **Confirmed Animals** are animals that are too small and weak to be used in a Pokemon battle. Like I said earlier, the Zygarde cell and core prove that there is a dividing line between what is a Pokemon and what isn't. Pokemon like Magikarp probebly only just qualifies due to have an evolution with moves. Overwise, it would likly not be a Pokemon, as it has no effective moves (over then tackle).

It should also be noted that small creatures non-superpowered fast breeding creatures must exist in order to have a stable ecosystem. I mean, if all insects are the size of small dogs, or bigger what's pollinating the flowers? And if every creature has powerful moves, how do predators effectively hunt their prey? It's too much of a gamble if their aren't any small spawning creatures providing easy food, and every predator had to battle their prey.

**Cryptic Animals** are a different story. For this I bring up this link: [Disputed Pokémon - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia (bulbagarden.net)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Disputed_Pok%C3%A9mon)

This page shows use that there are creatures that are clearly not real animals, but that are not identified as Pokemon. One of these disputed Pokemon is the alleged ""Whale"" the Manga ""The Electric Tale of Pikachu"", which as the article points out, has three sets of flippers.

My guess, is that many of the cryptic animals are actually unidentified pokemon that are eaither extinct or from an unknown region. The Mongoose could be a now extinct Kantonian varient of Yungoos or Gumshoos, Pokemon which are said to be foreign to Alola a place known for it's reginal variants of Kanto Pokemon.

The deer head could also be an unidentified Pokemon that's eaither extinct or was obtained by the home owner outside the Kanto region.

Same principle with the elephant, tiger and swan

The seagulls could be Wingulls or they could be too weak to be Pokemon, but I have a better theory. I think seagulls are actually spirits, hence why Miranda was able to talk to them and why they are not seen.

Cows and Chicken (and possibly Turkeys), I think might be Pokemon that have been domesticated for meat, and possibly not suitable for battle.

Regular mice and rats might exist (they get mentioned enough), but are too weak to be Pokemon.

Now I have a confession to make. I was originally going to make this post a month ago, but now I'm glad I delayed it, thanks to **""Pokémon Legends: Arceus""** which provides more evidence for my theory. firstly, Raichu's entry in that game now mentions Copperajah in place of Indian Elephants, implying that's what these so called ""Indian Elephants"" were this whole time. This game also have reginal variants of Pokemon from outside of Sinnoh (present day Hisui) confirming the idea of local extinctions, particularly that of reginal variants. (Though this does raise the question as to why they haven't been revived, since we know they can do that in this universe)

As for **Implied Animals,** the only ones that have images (which I can't find, sorry) are the Rabbit, Bear, Ducks, Horses and Giraffe. Of course, these could be written off of simplified caricatures of rabbit and bear-like Pokemon, such as Nidoran and Ursaring for the rabbit and bear. Kind of like Ty Beanie Babies.

The ""Owl"" pun could just be a short Noctowl.

Polecat, could mean something else in the Pokemon world.

The Chipmunks could eaitehr be unidentified Pokemon, or maybe even fictional ones.

Everything else, like Mice, Cats, Turtles ect, could just be categories like Canine and Rodent.",2

**ShSw Wondertrading:**

The pros: ShSw has the online functions active before you even get to the wild area. Meaning you can get you “real” Pokémon before you even make it to the first major city in game. You could also trade wherever you are in-game, meaning you don’t have to stop your progress in order to trade. Depending on the rules you play with, you could have a lot of encounters, especially if you have the DLC.

The cons: ShSw has a problem with websites trading hacked Pokémon through Wondertrade. Sure it could be a benefit to some, but when I’m at the third gym, a level 100 shiny Ho-oh isn’t gonna help me at all! Thanks but no thanks! Depending on the rules you play with, the amount of encounters could just be horrible to sit through and be able to find a Pokémon that doesn’t break the Species/Dupes Clause.

**BDSP Wondertrading:**

The pros: Hacked Pokémon aren’t an issue here at all. Every Pokémon I have encountered through Wondertrading has been a legit looking Pokémon. You could safely be assured that any Pokémon you get, you can throw in competitive if you’d like. The globe function is also rather fun, picking a random point in the map and watching where the person’s other point is. It’s visually appealing to me and I adore it.

The cons: You have to beat the first gym to even unlock Wondertrading. That itself is annoying when you’d prefer to beat the whole game with just traded Pokémon. The game is incredibly difficult at the beginning, when the level cap is 10 until you beat the second gym, which it’s then 30. And even then you struggle to get your Pokémon to listen to you until you beat the fourth badge, where the level cap is 50. How you wondertrade, is that you have to go back and forth to Jubilife City in order to trade. So you constantly have to run back and forth to Jubilife, or wait until you have a bunch waiting in the PC and just do it one city’s travel at a time. It takes a while to get new Pokémon until you get the third badge and Fly when it becomes a little more bearable.

He was one of his best Pokemon, and he was released with an irreversibile excuse, preventing him to return again fighting alongside Ash (and don't bother in telling me that he's returning in an upcoming episode. It will be a one-off thing. He's still fighting the Vines, proving that he will do it forever. He's not returning alongside Ash).

But the anime itself has always been a secondary thing to me, so the fact he won't fight alongside Ash anymore, is just a secondary reason for me to be mad. The real reason of why I hated that release, it was because... it represented the beginning of the end for Greninja as Pokemon as whole. Have you never noticed it guys? That excluding Super Smash Bros Ultimate (and only because Sakurai made the game with the concept of bringing back all of the past fighters), ever since Ash released his one, Greninja as Pokemon hasn't appeared in a SINGLE. POKEMON. GAME. Until the recent Pokemon Unite (which is a mobile game so who cares)? 

For whatever reason, The Pokemon Company seem to have come to hate Greninja in the latest years, and they did a huge disservice to it, and as a big fan of the Pokemon myself, this really pisses me off. I even had to resort to a fangame to have a way to enjoy using the Pokemon again (Pokemon Xenoverse, althought only in its X version created for the game. The original one is not avaliable in the game... yet). 

I've not been in good terms with The Pokemon Company lately (even thought I enjoyed New Pokemon Snap and Pokemon Legends Arceus) and the mistreatment they reserved for Greninja is one of the main reasons...",2

To this end, it might be interesting to make pokemon trainers based on real historical figures.

Here are some Germans:

Nietzsche -&gt; A trainer dedicated to building the perfect pokemon team (become the ubertrainer), he has been seeking the perfect pokemon team. Unconsciously, however, he has already decided on what his criteria for the perfect team are - pokemon with facial hair that's as imposing as his own!  
\-&gt; Alakazam, Alolan Golem, Samurott, Swalot, Honchkrow, Stoutland  


Freud -&gt; A Professor interested in exploring the subconscious mind of pokemon. His team consists of traumatised Pokemon and pokemon associated with dreams (But no Hypno, Freud did not believe in hypnosis)

1117,pokemon,"We've only had starters as mascots in gen 1, and since it's supposed to be 3 of them, the company would make one of them dirty if only the other 2 get to be the mascots, they would be farly more popular, so I don't think that's ever gonna happen again. So, what other pokemon you'll like to see on a videogame's box-publicity, that is not an overpowered legendary that puts in risk the entire region?

     Maybe a pseudo legendary? Well, if this was the case, it would be kinda cool if they designed 2, one for each version, making it really interesting that once again we are able to rise and train, and evolve our mascot, since his first stage evolution, and giving it the exposure of a mascot, will grant them starter like popularity that will motivate people to buy both games, to know and have the pseudo of the other one. This is one of my favorite options, cause there's lots of potential here: since it's the mascot, you can give it a unique story of the way you obtain it in game, and even some dynamic or special animations to interact with, a la Pikachu from yellow, to give it lots of personality and make it memorable.

     An Eveelution? Well this... Already happened, at least we have them as starters, and it felt good. Wes from pokemon colosseum had 2 eveelutions as his first pokemon in game, and it was really cool. I think I even got to like these mons better for the protagonism they had in this game. Even Evee himself have been a starter, and mascot, and Don't see anyone complaining. Problem is, yes, eveelutions are way too powerful to start a game in level five, and I doubt that formula is ever gonna change...

A mythical? What makes a mythical, a mythical, is not being available in game, just in events, so that would make it really hard for it to be a mascot.

A random Pokemon, that was a revelation in the previous generation? I was thinking this is the second best Idea. It doesn't have to be a pokemon that occupies a certain rol or hierarchy in the pokemon games to be representative, not even a fully evolved one; take Pikachu for example, being the face of the franchise. It just has to be a creature with enough charisma and a good design, that looks good on a box art and represents well the new introduced mons of its gen. It would also anihilate the need to make more Pikachu rip offs.",2

In my honest opinion, I think that the pikachu line is sort of lacking in any sort of special things, sure you have z-moves and gmax things, but I think that the mascot of pokémon deserves better. So I think that a 4th evolution after raichu would be awesome, its the pokémon mascot and should deserve something grand. Alolan raichu was kind of a bad decision in my eyes, there could of been something way cooler for the pikachu line. It also gives raichu more fame because you need to evolve pikachu into raichu in order to get an even better pokémon, possibly being legendary status. If something like this were to be developed, it should definitely be post game, a legendary status pokémon should not be given to the player before the E4. Its evolution should be extremely difficult too, being something like the things people did to see/catch the pokégods. And for those who will say that this is too different for pokemon, eevee has multiple evolution choices, so why not give pikachu an evolution gimmick as well?",2

from Tasmania and Adamantium, steel type

The claw-iron Pokémon

Tasmantium are an ancient Pokémon. They were always fairly strong, however they were overlooked by the first trainers to arrive in their homeland. This was because they were pure normal Pokémon way back in history. These Pokémon wanted trainers to battle with them so they evolved iron plates to make themselves more appealing. Now in the present they are creatures with metal skin. They are mostly nocturnal but lounge in the sun during the day. They are solitary for the most part, however some prefer small groups to hunt in.

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

This week's Pokémon is **Spiritomb**!

**#442 Spiritomb** (Japanese ミカルゲ Mikaruge)

*Forbidden Pokémon*

*It lays curses by thinking wicked thoughts. Writings tell that this Pokémon was born out of the assembly of five score and eight malevolent spirits.*

**Spiritomb's Base Stats:**

* **HP:** 50
* **Attack:** 92
* **Defense:** 108
* **Sp. Attack:** 92
* **Sp. Defense:** 108
* **Speed:** 35

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/spiritomb/)

**Introduction:**

Spiritomb has always been a fan favorite Pokémon as it has a cool design and an interesting backstory. It is also one of two Pokémon with the Dark/Ghost typing making it weak to only one type and immune to three different types! Yet, it's still sitting in PU.

Let's begin by looking at the stats. Spiritomb has average stats in almost every aspect. Both of its offensive stats are the same being base 92 which isn't anything special. Both of its defensive stats are also the same both being 108 which is better than a lot of Pokémon but still very lackluster. Now, Spiritomb's speed stat is extremely low which could make it a good potential trick room Pokémon. However, even in a Trick Room team, it gets outclassed by Pokémon such as Ferrothorn and Bronzong.

Spiritomb's movepool is a decent one, getting access to great moves such as Shadow Ball, Dark Pulse, Shadow Sneak and Poltergeist! The main issue with Spiritomb's movepool is the lack of coverage as it barely has any good moves that aren't Ghost or Dark. 

Spiritomb's abilities aren't great either. It gets Pressure which, let's be honest, is very bad. And it also gets infiltrator which is a very situational ability that rarely makes a difference.

**How viable do you trainers think Spiritomb is? Is there anything else you think it needs in order to be a good competitive Pokemon (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings)? What is its most optimal set?**

Spiritomb on - [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Spiritomb_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29) | [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/spiritomb/)

So I’m bad at art, however 2 videos by Truegreen7 peaked my interest. Randomized type and animal Pokémon, you’ll get the gist of it after I do this part.
I will only be making the concept not the Pokémon art. My goal is to make some facts, a name, and a signature move for these Pokémon.

So my animal today was the leopard cat, which I researched. They are small East Asian wild cats. 
My type was the conflicting combo of fairy/dragon.

I was a little worried on how to make a reptilian cat, but then I remembered I don’t have to make any art! So my first thoughts were some facts. Here is the Pokémon.

Benthai (Ben-tye) from bengal and Thai, the Malay word for spirit. Fairy/dragon type.

The attitude Pokémon

Benthai are strong battlers, they are guardian spirits of the jungle but also enjoy battling other Pokémon. They have minor life powers and can heal or harm people or Pokémon with those powers. They are solitary creatures and each have a certain area of jungle they protect and do not encroach on each other’s land. After they battle, if the enemy Pokémon is a friend of the forest they will heal the Pokémon, even powering it up. They have quite a fondness for basking in the sun in the treetops.

1162,pokemon,"Generally in Pokemon games, a given region's professor is the one responsible for the distribution of starter Pokemon. In Alola, however, starter Pokemon seem to be handed out by one of the four Island Kahunas, which I guess makes more sense than forcing Professor Kukui to constantly travel between islands to give new Trainers their first Pokemon. I suppose it still could be that he does that, he's certainly strong enough himself as a Trainer to make the trip, just that the fact the player moves to his island at the start of the game makes any travel unnecessary.

And then there's Galar. At the start of Sword and Shield, Leon just gives you a choice between Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble, with no indication that Professor Magnolia does the same thing, nor any indication in the anime of how Galar's starters are distributed. Is it just... one of Leon's responsibilities as Champion to breed and hand out starter Pokemon for new Trainers? Or did he just bring the starters that time because it so happened to be Hop who was starting his Gym Challenge that particular season?",2
1163,pokemon,CorSoda made by me,2
1164,pokemon,"With the new Pokemon games coming out soon I've been thinking about what gamefreak should do about EVs/IVs. I think we can all agree that this needs to change in some way or another. But I don't like the way Legends did it and I hope it doesn't carry over into Scarlet/Violet. I feel like the current system should stay (maybe IVs can go), because of what it brings to competitive, and instead change how you get EVs.

The solution I came up with is to keep EVs the way they are, but instead of Pokemon giving you a special attack EV or whatever, they just give you a singular EV, and you can pick and choose which specific stat it belongs to (with the option to change later). I'm also imagining a key item (or something similar) to go along with this (called in my mind the competitive team builder) that will let you pick and choose what EV spreads you want on your pokemon and they will be applied automatically. The item could even go a step further and offer something like the teambuilder on showdown and it could even show what pokemon/items are used most in competitive battles.

I really like this for a few reasons:

1. It makes building a competitive team much easier (especially for newcomers). You don't have to throw away pokemon that aren't good enough (or messed up on). At the end of the game you would have a competitively viable team without any extra effort. And you don't have to find a new pokemon every time you want a different EV spread.
2. It could make the base game more fun. Even if the new games are relatively easy, I see myself having a lot of fun building teams to get past tough trainers instead of grinding.

With the few people I've talked to about it, most have said that it would make things too complicated for the average person, but I doubt it. Mainly because not doing anything would be the same as before, where the EVs would be spread randomly.

As for IVs, I don't really care too much about them, but I think it could be fun if they were replaced with a generic ""talent"" level where in order to max your pokemon's talent you'd do a bunch of side quests to create an equivalent of the shadow-purifier from XD but instead for IVs/talent.

On a side note, I hope the Scarlet/Violet base game leans into competitive Pokemon a little bit more. I'm just getting into it and I think it's a lot of fun and I think there's a LOT of unused potential there.

Anyways what do you think?",2

1169,pokemon,"Leaf and Green (female) are fraternal twin sisters, named as such because green leaves are symbols of hope and renewal.

Ethan and Kris are not blood siblings, but were effectively raised as such. Their moms are both single mothers who live in New Bark Town as housemates to cut down on costs. (Kris's mom is the GSC mom, while Ethan's is the HGSS mom.)

Hilbert and Hilda are, surprisingly, NOT siblings. In fact, it freaks them out that their names share the exact same prefix despite having first met in Nimbasa as total strangers. Nowadays, it's a running gag that they're that weird couple that looks like each other, despite the fact that they're not dating and have no plans whatsoever to.

Elio and Selene are twins, who in fact are older siblings to another pair of twins named Ray and Ailey. Essentially, the nail in the Alola games can be summed up as the older twins or the younger twins following their mother to Alola instead of staying in Kanto with their father.

Chase and Elaine are adoptive siblings, adopted by the same woman at a young age.

Victor and Gloria are twins. One became a Trainer before the other, having borrowed their mum's Munchlax to catch a wild Pokemon on Route 1.

Scottie and Bettie (Masters) are twins. Bettie came to Pasio as the battler of the duo, while Scottie dictates the three-man teams that fight any given battle. However, Scottie forms a sync pair with Torchic, leaving Pikachu to Bettie full-time.",2

And if that wasn't enough, you also had the Three Musketeers + Keldio! They're a bit awkward in designs but I really liked the concept

It's just full of amazing designs and almost every Legendary has multiple forms and all of them have in universe reasons for having them. They're lore is interesting compared to other legendaries

Well, of course you have, because everyone have had that oddly specific question,   
well oh boy do I have news. Finally, we have the answer here at, my head.

It is  745'516'421'408'219, yep that number, that's it. So fantastic now you know the answer... but was all that, what was the reason for this I did you think of this thing the first time you read it.   
Well of course it is easy. The reason is... The reason is...Now you know how many ways you can make pokémon soup while camping in the beautiful pokémon world. Don't get me started on the upcoming Gen 9.

Kidding, I've already calculated that. Lets say that gen 9 adds 90 new pokémon that becomes 1'319'532'068'443'511 combinations, which is  574'015'647'035'292 new combinations, added in 3years time (gen 8 came late 2019)

So if we say that humans already tasted every soup until now. That would mean if we counted with 7.9billion humans on earth. Every human would need to eat a different soup no one else had tasted every 21min and 43secsto have tested all until in 3years (if gen 10 comes then).  


Extra Extra:   
After that we would guess the same +90 it would be 2'222'405'981'561'843   
That is amazingly 902'873'913'118'332 nearly the doubled amount. You would eat like 8 times more often in year 2031. Don't even get started if we had one more extra backpack space.   
898pokémons and 7space  -&gt;   96'384'623'053'491'299   
Also even more exponential.   
I don't even like soup. Okay, I do sometimes.   
How to calculate:   
a = number of pokémons   b = backpack size

My partner is a massive Pokémon fan, and has been basically his whole life. He is especially attached to Espeon, and has a number of merch items, plushies, etc. One of his favourites was a [pair of mugs](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/429460514453596149/) that were sold by the Pokémon center for valentine's day years ago.

Unfortunately, one of those two mugs has met a terrible fate, and has been destroyed. As luck would have it, it was of course the Espeon one.  He's not completely heartbroken over the loss, so if I can't find one, it isn't the end of the world. But he's definitely upset and I would love to surprise him with a replacement for his favourite mug if I can find one.

They are no longer sold anymore, and were a somewhat limited item to my understanding, so I expect that it will be next to impossible, but you can't succeed if you don't try. I attempted to search for one in the past with little luck, so I am reaching out in the hopes that someone may have a lead I could follow or may have one sitting around that they don't use. We are in Ontario, Canada, if that makes a difference, but I'm searching a broader area than that to improve my chances.

Thanks in advance, even if nothing is found, and I am sorry again if this is the wrong place. I don't normally participate in the Pokémon community, but I wanted to try for him.

A while back u/Noodnood966 started a series where they made a signature move for every Pokémon that didn’t already have a signature move. So with their permission I have chosen to continue their series. The last Pokémon they did was the yamask line(s) so I’ll be following with the Jellicent line

Regal Specter (ghost)

80power 100accuracy 10pp

The user uses its regal power to scare the opponent. The user heals their health by half of the damage done by this move. 

I wanted to make something Tammy for Jellicent as it’s highest stat is SPD and I feel like this move could help it survive longer as well as it is based on its shield Pokédex entry where it says that it siphons organisms life forces.

Here are the final results of this long adventure:

[https://imgur.com/a/tqgAAfX](https://imgur.com/a/tqgAAfX)

So... Yeah. I was crazy enough to attempt this challenge and, let me tell you, Gamefreak should have really come up with better ways to make completing the dex enjoyable. Some research tasks were pure boredom/nonsense (both at this point in the game and post-game).

This was the mission before you get to report to captain Cyllene, while you are still a No Star member. 

WARNING: long read ahead. If you're not interested in the details, just skip to the final section.

**The Beginning.**

When you get to the fiedlands you have access to about 30% of the map (from Sandgem Flats to Horshoe Plains).

I spent a GOOD WHILE, trying to complete most entries that I had available to me, trying to spawn 35 Eevees, defeating countless bidoofs to get the move tasks done, farming items to keep crafting pokéballs as I traveled around, etc.

Drifloon/drifblim was a nice pokémon to use, but I never knew it was THAT good of a pokémon until now (even if it's not the same as in the main games). It has access to a variety of strong/useful moves and it is both tanky and a sweeper, so I made sure to always have my ghostly friend in top condition.

**The first problems presented themselves** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/

While dealing with Shinx entry, I realised that I needed a Ground type move to be able to complete its research tasks, but none of the pokémon available in the area were able to learn such moves.

My first thought, obviously, was to catch a geodude, but the ore deposits from the areas nearest to the camp never shaked during this challenge (not sure if it is coded like that or if it was extremely bad luck). So I braced myself and travelled to the far west of the map. And, right where Alpha Snorlax is, an ore deposit was shaking and a graveler leapt at me all furious for breaking its hideout.

Once it was caught and I was all excited to continue my jorney, I sent out my Graveler to bury Shinx in dirt and... it refused to obey. I had forgotten that the obedience level in this game is only up to level 10 at first and my graveler was level 28. 

What to do then? Well, just like in the main entries, if you keep insisting, your pokémon will eventually use the move, but it can take a looooot of tries. It is what it is, I guess. But, how was it possible that my other pokémon kept listening to my commands if they were around level 30 by then?

You see, if you catch a pokémon at level 10 or lower, no matter how much you level them up, they will always listen to you. This was also true for the main entries (I believe?), as only traded pokémon wouldn't listen to you if they where a higher level than your badges let you control.

 These were bittersweet news, as the challenge had extended a lot more now, because some pokémon only appear in the wild at higher levels than 10. At least I noticed that if a pokémon had high friendship, it listened to my commands more frequently (or maybe it was just luck).

Another problem that I encountered was the fact that pokéballs were too weak to catch Alphas/higher level pokémon, so you have to keep weakening them and keep throwing balls until they decided to stay in. 

Hypnosis and Mystical Fire were crucial here, that's why Drifblim was a key pokémon during this challenge (plus immunity to Double-Edge). Alpha Alakazam was particularly troublesome at times, but using a certain cheese strat, it was manageable (I'll get to that later).

**It is taking too long, but who cares, I want more...**

I'm sure you remember that a member of Security Corp is blocking the bridge to access the rest of the map until you become First Star.

However, I was totally convinced that you could cross to the other side, but I realised that what I did in my first playthrough was jumping with Wyrdeer, which wasn't an option here. Rolling won't get you far enough and you won't be able to reach the other side before drowning.

That's when I travelled to the point where both sides get closer (the place where Alpha Floatzel spawns) and let all my pokes out in the water trying to find some glitch that would make me use them as a bridge. And, to my surprise, running on top of Bibarel, who was floating very close to the edge, launched me forward and I managed to get to the other side.

I was so excited again, thinking I had made such a discovery only to see that other people had already used Bibarel bridges before -\_\_- Oh, well. At least I had access to almost every pokémon in the fieldlands now.

**More problems came to greet me** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/

My team by then was Drifblim, Bibarel, Luxray, Floatzel, Graveler (evolved from a lvl 9 geodude :\^) ) and Leafeon, which let me use almost any type of move I needed. But, while you are able to use fast travel even before the game mentions it, having to travel the whole map on foot, COUNTLESS TIMES, was very painful.

I had to make sure my pokémon were in good health all the time as you can't craft revives until a mission later, so I tried to go back to camp only to restore pp or if I needed to change the time of the day (though I ended up doing this more than I expected).

Some pokémon were nightmarish to get. Golbat was such a PAIN because they don't spawn until your rank is higher, except for an Alpha at the entrance of Oreburrow Tunnel. You have to catch it 20 times at night and you have to defeat it 50 frigging times, 25 with psychic moves and 25 with ice moves (WHICH ONLY ALPHA POKÉMON COULD HAVE AND THEY ARE HIGHER THAN LEVEL 10 x\_\_\_\_x ). 

Munchlax took a while as well, (and when I finally got 10 of them I found 3 of them in a row ¬\_\_¬), and those pesky Pichu/Pikachu too, but they appeared more often for me.

**Can I get there?**

During my first playthrough, I got on top of Oreburrow Tunnel early game thanks to Wyrdeer, but that was not an option now. 

I kept trying a trick that supposedly lets you climb mountains by pressing ZR and quickly cancelling with B, but it didn't work for me. And then I noticed that if you didn't take a full step forwards, you wouldn't slip down and you could reach further on the slope. It doesn't work for straight up walls, as you need to be able to walk on it, so it would only work if there is some kind of slope/edge you can walk on. 

Anyway, that gave me access to some more painful to catch pokémon (Chanseys kept running away and I had to weaken them first  :'( ) but this was a very good spot to farm Thunder and Water Stones.

But if I got on top of the tunnel, how would I not get to Ramanas Island now that I knew how to do it? I spent almost an entire afternoon practising my Bridgebarel skills until I finally reached the island, and since I was doing it where Alpha Lopunny spawns and I managed to get cherrim/cherubi's tasks done at the same time.

I stayed in the island for almost another 4 hours catching/defeating Aipoms, Qwillfish (yes, they spawn near the island) and completing Infernape's tasks. All of this after bringing with me the huge supply of items that I had amassed on my travels, of course.

Giving up on spawning a Monferno on the island to give it food (though right after that it spawned in Deertrack Heights), I left with, unfortunately, more tedious work to do. Evolving 5 Stantlers was exhausting enough, but evolving 5 Qwillfish that wouldn't listen to you was even worse.

**Cheese Strats for the win.**

Most of you probably now this, but if you start a battle by hitting the pokémon's back, their first turn (or 2 turns) will be skipped and you will always go first. I used this strat to weaken Alpha pokémon and get them to red health. Just attack, run away and hit them from the back again (you must be targeted first, though, or they'll heal up).

However, I also realized that if you put a status condition (such as drowsiness) on a pokémon and throw a pokéball, then run away if it doesn't get caught, when you reenter the battle, the status condition will still be there. 

Thus, for fast pokémon like Alpha Alakazam, it was in my best interest to make them sleepy first and throw a ball, then proceed to weaken them next. If I did that the other way around, Alakazam destroyed my pokémon and I had to go back to camp and again all the way to the far end of the map.

**Let's close this chapter already.**

To sum up this ""challenge"", I spent 127hours to complete virtually every task that can be completed up to that point (you can't complete the ones requiring you to defeat an enemy that doesn't spawn there, catching some sleeping pokémon was impossible, etc).

I gave up trying to evolve Happininy because you need oval stones and Chanseys wouldn't deem me worth enough to drop them, even after catching 15 and defeating 50 of them :'( (and when I went back on the next mission they dropped one first try T\_\_T).

Also, using Hurricane 70 times with such bad accuracy and with a grumpy unobedient Gyarados was a big NO for me, so I used it just 3 times instead. Btw, you can defeat them early by climbing the mountains next to Alpha Luxio and dropping next to Lake Verity in a certain spot.

And I believe that was it. I reported back to the professor, and there were my results:

I caught more than a thousand pokémon but the counter stopped at 999,  58 different pokémon (evolutions doesn't count), 53 for the first time ( would be 55 with bidoof/starly/shinx, so I'm two off and I really don't know why?), 514 back strikes and 71 alphas.

For that I was awarded the trifling sum of 38.460 rank points and reported my progress to Captain Cyllene, who advanced me to 9th Star from just one expedition. After this? I don't want to hear about pokémon ever again... Who am I kidding? Can't say no to my pretty boy beldum.

1310,pokemon,"So here's my opinion about the stories  of pokemon games.

  


People value the story of a game way higher than they should, the story is just 20 minutes of fighting grunts and 3 minute cutscenes every 4 hours of your playthrough and you value that more than the postgame.

I can see why you would value it more but I think the stories are just repetitive and its something that's just there and you forget about it and remember it on the remaster of the game.

I don't think all of the stories are bad I just think that most of them are just bland in comparison to the creative stories like Sun &amp; Moon or Black &amp; White 1 &amp; 2 or PLA which is my favorite from them I think those stories introduce the legendry's of the game in a cool and new way unlike most of the stories where its just the same way and you are more excited to see the design of the new legendary than see the whole story, and even they still have a lot of repetitive battles (except PLA).  
 People hate the game way more just because it has less story when most people finish the story in like the first 3 days they get the game and then go on to the postgame and then say that it doesn't feel like old games which I understand but some games just want to stand out.

 xy didn't focus on the story that much because the developer's put on more effort in the gts and the online battles and people where mad back then but look how that has become.

I know this is probably very controversial but I think the postgame is better than the story and i just don't know why so many people buy the game and be so focused on the story part of it.",2

Meowth (Team Rocket), Mewtwo and Pikachu are the only ones I can remember who've talked but Meowth (Team Rocket) is more of a member of Team Rocket than he is a pokemon sent out for battling, Mewtwo has no trainer, and Pikachu doesn't refer to Ash in anyway if I remember correctly.

I would imagine they would call their trainers ""trainer"" but that sounds emotionally distant, as if pokemon and trainers are simply co-workers which would go against one of the core messages of Pokemon where pokemon are friends.

They might refer to their trainers using the actual name of their trainers, which makes the most sense.

Certain... works of fans have pokemon call their trainers ""master"". You know exactly what I'm referring to. If those works did not exist it might still make sense in a way because they do everything their trainer tells them to do without question unless they don't have the proper gym badge or the story makes them not listen to their trainer.

Gen 5 didn’t get a lot of love upon release so idk if Game Freak would even want to remake them because of that.

Then you also just have the trend of remaking the games every other generation at this point. 

Although I feel like Gen 5 is in an awkward position where it’s the only generation that has sequels to the originals. So would they remake B/W one generation and then in alter generation remake B2/W2? Or would they remake both of them during the same generation just releasing on different years?

Then Gen 6 just felt incomplete, part of that is due to not having a Pokémon Z game which resulted in Zygarde just being shoved into Gen 7.

I decided to make a living dex in Pokémon home, but I was wondering if there were any unwritten rules for making one. For example, all Pokémon must be from from an OT you have. Another one being, Pokémon must come from their original game.

I get that they decided to do Journeys as a way to introduce the story for new viewers and revisit old plots and characters, but they could do that between Alola and Galar, and let Galar have its spotlight!

Galar is the only region that didn't get a full anime gen for itself, so it feels like the writing team had everything planned for it but had to smash it in a 5 part special instead of a full season at least.

That's why characters got really self-explanotory some times like Professor Magnólia out of nowhere talking about Rossi's villaines, and Rossi out of nowhere explaining his background story as if he is was Heinz Doofenshmirtz!!!

A crazy villain like Rossi is interesting if developed correctly and the whole thing about the ""2 kings a sword and a shield"" that were actually the legendaries would be cool stories with a lot mistery if they treated similar to how they treated Alola's misteries like Lily's fear.",2

Out of all three of the starters from generation 4, which one do you think is the strongest?  This counts in terms of usefulness, stats, and also moves.  Which one is the strongest?  Let me know why, too (comment)!

But then something occurred: every generation has that rare, mystical, chibi but powerful mythical guardian pokemon starting with Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Manaphy, Victini, Diancie, Marshadow (yes) and...then nothing?   


Zarude clearly not fitting the bill for cute and mystical, I'm wondering why there's no Mythical Guardian for Gen8 unless Meltan is which fits the bill aesthetically but not in terms of there being many and then evolving?",2
1373,pokemon,"I put a huge amount of time into heart gold, black and Omega ruby back in the day and I figured I would try to come back to the series with this game because it looked really interesting and different, but it just won't click for me. I don't think I'm that far into the main story so that might be part of it (just unlocked cobalt coastlands). 

In the old games you pick your starter and head off into the world to make your name. The story progressed in each town you visited and you were never really tied to home. In fact you're almost always far from home and it feels like a big adventure. In Arceus you're basically immediately drafted into the town militia and have to do missions for them. I spend enough of my real life hours working for a boss that being bossed around in a game just feels very unfun to me. Like I really want to punch that snarky dude that checks my rank points in his dumb face but I can't.

This is a bummer to me because the visuals and battle system are too notch and there are so many great pokemon picks that I can't even settle on one team. Does it get better? Anyone else have this problem?",2

1376,pokemon,"Hello! Do you think Timer Balls are woefully underused? Do you like fossils? Do you think Fossil Pokémon look good in Timer Balls? Then here's some guidance on an esoteric and highly specific Breeding chain relevant to that.

In Gen V, the Dream World granted more than merely a taste of the fleeting nature of online services, as it also granted access to a wide variety of Pokémon with their Hidden Abilities. Normally, when we think of these Dream World-granted monsters, we think they all come in Dream Balls. Meaning that, barring the Gen VII+ exclusive Ball Swap (better name pending) Breeding Mechanic, it would have been impossible to get an HA Pre-Gen VIII Fossil Pokémon in a Timer Ball. **This is not true.**

In fact, the descendents of these dream-descended 'Mons can be in **any** Ball Type that Gen V could muster. That includes Timer Balls. This is because, while a single Dream Ball was provided whenever a Mon was to be retrieved from the Dream World, Trainers were free to use any Ball they had on hand when they actually encountered the Pokémon to ""catch"" it, not just the Dream Ball.

Now, as we know, Ball Inheritance did not become a thing until Gen VI. However, as there are no Ribbons in Gen V, an egg-born Mon from Gen VI can have the exact same Ribbon Potential as its parents.

In short, you can (in theory) have a Shiny, Contest-Winning, Hidden Ability, Timer Ball Kabutops/Omastar/Aerodactyl/Cranidos/Bastiodon/Cradily/Armaldo/Carracosta with impressive birth stats, breeding-specified nature, and Ribbons originating from as early as Gen VI. (Archeops, Tyrantrum, and Aurorus in Timer Balls are not available until Gen VIII in SwSh because they weren't in the Dream World and could not be caught before Gen VIII, only revived in stock Poké Balls.)

Then Generation 4 was released in 2006 which was actually 4 years later with generation 5 being in 2010 which was also 4 years later. Then when Generation 6 was released 3 years later in 2013 Pokemon went back to its original routine releasing Generations every 3 years again. If they stuck with the 4-year routine Pokemon would have turned out like this:

Gen 6: 2014
Gen 7: 2018 (which probably would have ended up making Sun and Moon for the Switch)
Gen 8: 2022

1382,pokemon,"I was really excited about the Generation 4 remakes since those were the first Pokémon games I played and actually understood what I was doing. But in remake 1 (BDSP) we got the absolutely horrendous chibi art style which, for me, ruined the entire game.

We got Legends Arceus, which I get why people dig it. They're multiple very good things about it but it still just looks unfinished. Like they didn't polish anything. 

Between SWSH's wild area, BDSP's chibi art style, Legends' empty environments and hell, even the animation quality of the new Generation 9 games (more big, empty environments with PS2 graphics) compared to literally anything else coming out the last couple of years, I don't get what's going on at Game Freak.

Aren't they one of the richest game developers in the world?

Do they not upgrade quality and attention to detail because people will buy their games anyway?

I'm admittedly not the biggest Pokémon fan out there, but I don't get why Pokémon seems like it's lagging behind everyone while still being miles ahead of everyone.

Just something that came to mind.

Due to how comments work, if I simply asked “what’s your favourite generation and why?”, some generations would have far more comments at the top than others and people might have to dig deep for even one comment about a less talked about generation. 

I thought this was kind of unfair, so I thought this might be a better way to get some actual information about why people like certain gens: Just ask specifically about why people love 1 particular gen every couple of days and see what info we get out of it.

I ask this because these pokemon are in a unique position. They are legendary pokemon but they tend to have a BST of 580 (both Glalie and Lopunny have this same BST) so I feel they fall into a grey area of being powerful but not as powerful as box legendaries, mythicals or pseudo legendaries.

Edit: just to make this clear I'm NOT talking about box legendaries like Groudon or Reshiram, just the ""lesser"" legendaries you'll find during your play through that all have a BST of 580. And yes I am now aware of Glalie and Lopunny having that BST after mega evolution but my point was that these lesser legendaries aren't THAT much more powerful than some regular Pokémon.",2
1412,pokemon,"While i am working on my Siberian region, i made a mechanic that is literally moves that have double typing and new abilities. Let me explain.
Some moves have one type, but certain TMs can have double typing, which does double type damage to certain pokemon and can do a massive amount of danage to a pokemon with weakness to two types of an ability. TM's full potential can be revealed by a certain NPC, full potential of TM is able to give a move another typing and a possibly new ability. Let me use some moves as examples: Scald is a Water/Fire move that is not only able to burn the target, but also this move can hurt enemies with Dry Skin and different Water obsorbing abilities. X-Scissor is a Bug/Steel type move, that can now cause bleed damage, making them slowly lose medium amount of hp, until pokemon stops bleeding out.

To make it more balanced, pokemon will be able to only use either only 1 or 2 double type TMs, because information on imoroved TM is too difficult for a pokemon to understand, so they can only remember one or two moves. But they can forget the double type move and replace it with a normal one or another double type move.",2

1415,pokemon,"Hello, my name is Gyro Miller and after playing through 2 Nuzlocke's, I can safely say I have a good knowledge on Nuzlocke's in general. With that being said, the hardest part for a Nuzlocke is the Pokemon Type because each Type has its benefits and drawbacks. Today I'll be discussing The Top 5 Best Pokemon Types In A Nuzlocke. I'll be judging and ranking each Type based off of 3 principles:

1. The Pokemon Within The Type.
2. How Good/Useful It Is In A Nuzlocke.
3. The Weaknesses Of The Type.

If you disagree with any of my choices, then please leave your list in the comment section below and we start a discussion on why you disagree. If your friend(s) are having trouble with their Nuzlocke, then be sure to share this list with them because this list might help them out a lot! Now, let the list begin!

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Dragon:** This is the BEST Pokemon Type because of Dragonite, Flygon, Salamance, and many other Dragon Type Pokemon. The moves a Dragon Type Pokemon can learn are god like. These moves include Dragon Darts, Dragon Hammer, Dragon Pulse, Dragon Rage, etc. There are no reasons as to why Dragon Type would be bad in ANY Nuzlocke Run (that is, if you're playing a normal Nuzlocke).
2. **Normal:** Besides from having GOD HIMSELF as a Pokemon under this Type, Normal Type Pokemon are the Chads of a Pokemon Nuzlocke. Think about it, they can basically learn any move and the Pokemon Miltank and Chancey are absolute BEASTS in a Nuzlocke. Hell, the day I learned that Chancey got an evolution, was the day I accepted it as a God Tier Pokemon. Not only that, but Miltank got its fame from wiping everyone's Nuzlocke Team. However, they are known for having the weaker Pokemon, so based off of that, I'll rank it as #2.
3. **Fire:** If you are ever starting a Pokemon Nuzlocke, ALWAYS go with a Fire Starter. Going with the Fire Starter Pokemon has always helped me out when it comes to completing a Nuzlocke, plus if you're starting your Nuzlocke in a Gen with barely any Fire Types, then a Fire Starter is always the best to go with! However, besides from the Fire Starters, their aren't any good Fire Type Pokemon (that I know of). If there is a good Fire Type Pokemon, that isn't a Fire Starter, then please let me know in the comments, but until then, Fire Type is at #3 on the list!
4. **Water:** This Type of Pokemon is amazing to have because of Magikarp and Vaporeon. Anyone who has a Magikarp on their team will pretty much sweep any team because Magikarp evolves to Gyarados. Gyarados is a godly Water Type because it can learn Dragon Rage and we all know how perfect Dragon Rage is. Vaporeon is a good Water Type because it's the 2nd best Evee Evolution (based off of stats) and it learns Ice Type Moves. Anyways, the problem with Water Types is that there aren't any good Water Type Pokemon (except Gyarados).
5. **Flying:** Through out every Nuzlocke I've seen and play through, everyone always has a Flying Type in their team. Pokemon like Pidgey and Spearow are amazing Pokemon to start with and they are perfect to have later on! Plus, the Move Fly is the best Move for any Pokemon to know. However, there aren't many good Flying Types and in a Gen 1 Nuzlocke; Charizard (a Fire Type) instantly replaces the Flying Type Pokemon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've reached the end of the list, let me your thoughts on this post in the comment section below, Let me know if you agree, disagree, or have a list of your own. Share this post with anyone who's thinking about starting their own Nuzlocke run. My name is Gyro Miller and I'll see you on my next post!",2

This ROM hack was fantastic. It has a ridiculous amount of content and features, including over 800 Pokemon, Mega Evolutions, raid dens with Dynamax Pokemon, a brand new region, an interesting storyline, level scaling for Gym leaders, the ability to view base stats, IV and EVs, in-game mining for items like in the Sinnoh Underground, and a huge list of sidequests to complete.

It also has 4 difficulty modes, ranging from 'Vanilla' to 'Insane'. There are so many options for players and the game is enjoyable as both a casual and hardcore experience.

1420,pokemon,"I've been wanting to play Pokemon B2 and W2 for a while now, but I can only find the romhacks. I just want to know if these games are worth playing, or if they're too different from the original releases. If the gameplay (especially the story) is too different from the original release, I don't think I'll bother, but I feel like I'm missing out if I don't get to experience the story.",2
1421,pokemon,"It just makes sense to me:
At this point Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have been released almost 6 months ago. Legends Arceus has been released for over two months. Only few people who plan on buying these games, haven't yet and most of those people aren't waiting on Home compatability before purchasing.

There's no incentive anymore for GameFreak to update Pokemon Home for these games. But there will be incentive to update Home for Scarlet and Violet, seen as those are mainline games and GameFreak wants these games to sell really well and will try to move the competitive pokemon scene over to these games. 

So my guess is that Pokemon Home will be updated to be compatible with BDSP, PLA and SV all at once. This will probably happen in the last quarter of 2022. So the promise to make BDSP and PLA compatible with Home in 2022 will be respected.

What do you guys think?",2

1423,pokemon,"It's no secret that Z-Moves and even moreso Dyna/Gigantamax were highly controversial additions. But I think the underlying ideas aren't bad and they could've been great if properly implemented.

The way Z-Moves worked out they were essentially a once per game ""delete Pokémon"" button. Crawdaunt not hitting hard enough? Throw on a Waterium Z and watch Crabhammer oneshot most things.    
The way Dyna- and Gigantamax are right now is they're a horribly effective combination of becoming extremely tanky (1.5 - 2x as much HP) and free access to great supporting moves while still keeping the pressure. Just putting Bounce on Gyarados lets you use Max Airstream for 130 power for three turns, each of which raises the speed of (both) your active Pokémon.

Ideally Z-Moves would be worthwhile and strong enough to warrant using an item over without being too unfair to the opponent, and Dyna/Gigamax would be balanced enough so that it's worth using, but doesn't completely dominate the battle.

My concept: give Z-Moves the gimmick of Max Moves, in that they are strong moves that give access to useful side-effects.    
 In Gen7 Supersonic Skystrike (Hurricane) is a 185 power special move with no side effect, only being usable once per battle. Max Airstream (Hurricane) is a 140 power special move that raises speed of the user (and its ally) by one stage, but is usable up to three turns in a row. I would further suggest to cap the power at roughly 130 power. This is about what you can expect from a random coverage move, but instead of the usual downside that those moves have (-2 Sp.Atk, horrible accuracy, etc) the moves come with upside.    
So my theoretical new Flying Z-Move would be 130 power, single-use and raises the user's speed (and that of allies) by one stage.    
Now for Dynamax, I would reduce the moves to be regular, decent moves without side-effects. All status moves still become Max Guard, but all offensive moves become 85 power, 100 accuracy moves. Dynamax becomes a purely defensive tool, allowing to keep up overall pressure and enabling things like Weakness Policy, but having to sacrifice offensive pressure in turn. I think 2x HP boost might still be too much even after these changes, so possibly turn that turn to 1.75x as well.     
Finally for these two, make Dynamax and Z-Moves compete for the same slot. You cannot Dynamax a Pokémon if you already used a Z-Move this battle, or vice-versa.

Here's the one where it get's a bit weird: Gigantamax. Right now it's just a reskin of Dynamax, but with the (in my opinion) great designs they put into the Gigantamax forms themselves I would rather have it be something more akin to a limited mega evolution. Just using Gigamax as it is would be too strong (as NationalDex on Showdown showed). First of I'd make it a copy of my new Dynamax system - HP boost is limited to 1.75x and all moves are 85 power with no secondary effects. Then, because the whole point of Gigantamax is to use G-Max Moves: give the Pokémon back the secondary effects of their Gigantamax moves, but only for their primary typing. (I know, not all G-Max Moves share the user's primary typing, but hear me out). Finally, give the user back the power of Max moves for their secondary typing only - capped at 130 like for Dynamax.    
In essence, GMAX-Corviknight (Flying/Steel) gets the secondary effect of its GMAX Move on its Flying type attacks (with 75 power) and can use Steel type MAX moves with up to 130 power. A GMAX-Skarmory (if that existed) would get the secondary effect of its GMAX Move on its Steel type attacks (with 75 power) and can use Flying type MAX moves with up to 130 power. A single-type GMAX-Pokémon, like Blastoise, would get both the secondary effect and power boost to its GMAX Move, making it much stronger but also more predictable.     
Just like Z-Moves and Dynamax competing, Gigantamax would compete with Mega evolution - you can bring one or the other. You probably also shouldn't be able to bring both Gigantamax and Dynamax. So you can bring either Z-Move plus Mega, Z-Move plus Gigantamax, or Dynamax plus Mega.

Finally, about Protect and Max Guard (and a possible Z-Protect). Z-Moves right now go partially through protect and activate their secondary effect, as do MAX and GMAX moves. I would suggest that both Z and GMAX moves can go through for 25% damage and activate their secondary effects, but regular MAX moves cannot (since now they're just regular moves limited to Dynamax). Max Guard and a new Z-Protect should fully protect against not only Z and GMAX attacks, but also against abilities like Unseen Fist and Moves like Hyperspace Hole.

Now, will any of this happen? No, obviously not. Gamefreak has a record of abandoning even working features and there's little chance they'll reintroduce a feature, especially if it needs fixing. This is just fun theorycrafting to see how these gimmicks could potentially coexist without players being essentially forced to use any one of these.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Make Z Moves the strong attacks with side effects, make MAX moves vanilla moves with average power and make GMAX moves strong or supporting based on primary and/or secondary typing. Limit Z Move/Mega/Dynamax/Gigamax so you have to think about which to bring.",2

So my first Pokemon was Yellow, about 10 years late, when I was around 5/6 in circa 2010. But my second was Platinum, and it's probably my most played Pokemon game to date, because my brother chucked my Gameboy out a window when I was around 7 or 8 so I was stuck with my DS. And as you likely know, Bronzong and Bronzor are incredibly common in that game. However, when I was a kid, I always viewed it ""wrong."" I saw the red circles as its cheeks, and the dark grey patches at the top as its eyes. A friend of mine described this view as a ""grandma,"" which I think is fitting. It was only until I got back into Pokemon at 16, where I super hardcore hyperfixated (I have ADHD) on the franchise when I realized what it was actually meant to be viewed as, where the red is the eyes and the dark grey parts are just designs.

There are multiple ways to practise MTG alone and one of them s Challenge Decks.

https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Challenge_Deck

Which you basically play against with rules for solitaire play. As n these decks are designed for a lone person and using them in actual 
competition, even friendly games against acquaintances, is almost impossible esp if you seek to win games with them.

I never heard of these at all in YGO, Digimon, and Pokemon so  have to ask if the exist? Considering Yu Gi Oh is the most popular CCG in the world and Pokemon is in the same league with YGO and Magic as the Big 3s of TCGs,  find it impossible this doesn't exist for those games.

1443,pokemon,"There are many features in Pokémon games.  Some are loved and others are hated.  A lot are hated.  What thing do you definitely NOT want to see brought back into Gen. 9?  For me, that would probably be the Fire/Fighting type duo or humanoid final evos that don’t fit the first form.  We’ve gotten far too many of those at this point.  It was cool when it was first introduced with Blaziken, but after they did this to Infernape, Emboar, Delphox, Incineroar, and even kinda Cinderace, I just really want a break from this.  I really hope they don’t do this to Fuecoco, Quaxly, or Sprigatito.  What do you not want to see (comment)?",2
1444,pokemon,I loved Pokemon and its community always. But often I always seem to find negative things about the Pokemon community. Sure some fans are not the best but every fan I encountered seemed to be friendly.

1445,pokemon,"When gen 5 got released I didn’t really like the Pokémon designs. To me they looked so weird and I disliked most designs. They didn’t really look like  Pokémon to me, but more like creatures from a rip off game. However when the sprites got 3D in later games and when gen 5 got added to Pokémon go the designs has really grown to me and I like most of them. Do more people feel the same way? The sprites in gen 5 looked so weird in my opinion and now all the Pokémon gen 5 are in 3D they look so much better and really as Pokémon. I really need to replay the games someday now after liking the design much more. The games itself were great not BW and BW2.",2
1446,pokemon,"So based on the pattern of remakes, Pokémon will be coming up to B/W remakes within the next few years. With that being said B/W are known for having a sequel instead of a third game so if they’re remade then will we have to wait for the sequels to be remade or forgotten to time? With this thought I came up of a few ideas they might do and some are as straight forward as the poll says. The main 2 I’ll go briefly over will be elements of B2/W2 and post game

My idea with this would be taking ideas from B2/W2 and putting it B/W. The relic tunnel, PWT will all be available but will have the B/W story. Might have ghestsis already have kyruem for his final battle after N to set up a post game with the fusion kyruem. Many places would have post game like the reversal mountain and pokestar studios. 

I’m no game maker so these ideas are terrible explained but it’s just to give gears turning and if you have better ideas please let me know. This is just something I thought about while driving To school.

1448,pokemon,"Hello! I'm here because I was recently inspired by Nick Robinson's recent video where he helped someone recover their Blastoise in their LeafGreen save file after his file was corrupted over 15 years ago. This is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqgmR1Hqvbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqgmR1Hqvbk)

In the video, the people involved talked about how each person has a ""Pokemon tragedy"", where someone's beloved save file or Pokemon was lost. For my case, this is my Pokemon Y cartridge. I played that game for well over 300 hours and is the first game I completed the national Pokedex in. I lost it in 2016 shortly before Sun and Moon came out; fortunately, I had just finished transferring the last of the Pokemon I needed into Bank for my living dex. Unfortunately, my team I had used to beat the game was still on the cartridge. I lost the cartridge at my high school, and never found it no matter how hard I looked. 

I was wondering if there was even a tiny chance someone happened to find the cartridge (likely after someone found/stole it and then sold it) and still has it could see this post. I don't want to reveal much about my location, but I lived in central Kentucky at the time. Other information includes:

Trainer ID: 64543  
Trainer Name: Oliver  
Team Members: Delphox (Firefox), Venusaur (Rex), Aegislash (SkywardSword), Yveltal (Y Destroyer)

1450,pokemon,"For me, I would pick strength sap. Its ability to completely nullify physical attackers and heal the user all the way back to full is the most infuriating to go up against in my opinion. Thankfully it is quite rare, with only Cursola, Polteageist, Shiinotic, Drifblim, Jellicent, Vileplume, and Bellossom having the ability to learn it (some of the prevolutions of those mons do get it as well). A couple of those mons are really bulky as it is, and do not need a free heal all the way back to full plus an attack drop.

My prediction is that spore and any evasion move will be common picks, but I'm curious what everyone hates the most.


Edit: Looks like the most common ban is stealth rocks.

1460,pokemon,"**WARNING: LONG**

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen this discussion multiply times. Real animals have been seen in Pokemon, not just the anime, but the games as well.

This raise a question. What is the difference between a Pokemon and an animal? Why can't a cow, tiger or elephant be trained and used in a Pokemon battle?

Unfortunately, nobody has given an answer I can accept. So I'm going to explore the issue myself, and come up with a theory, that (hopefully) makes sense.

**Disclaimer:** I'll be using the anime as my main source for this theory, but I will include the games and other media as well. Contrary to popular belief, animals are NOT an anime exclusive thing, and do appear in the games. Also, I will ONLY be using the original Japanese dub. Animals mentioned only in the English dub (like lions and reindeer) will NOT be include in this theory.

Also, I will be looking at things from a Watsonian view point rather then a Doylist one

&amp;#x200B;

# Debunking a few theories

Like I said, I have seen people try to answer this question many times. Unfortunately, these theories don't make sense, or at least not for every species. I mean, a goldfish is different to a mongoose which is different to an elephant. As such, no ""one size fits all"" explanation will do.

One popular explanation is: ""**Animals don't have moves**"". This comes from the Zygarde cell and core, which explains that they are not Pokemon because they lack moves. This explanation works for things like goldfish and insects, as they are small and can't do much in a fight. But what about an elephant or a tiger? They have plenty of moves (albeit normal type) that would be affective in a Pokemon battle.

As I said before, a ""one size fits all"" theory just wont work.

Another explanation is: ""**Animals are weak, and not as invulnerable to things like electricity and fire, and would therefore DIE if used in a Pokemon battle**"". I'm afraid that doesn't work eaither. I mean, there is one animal that appears in every Pokemon media to date that shows the same level of toughness Pokemon have. That animal is of course humans.

Humans in the Pokemon world are shown to have high resistance to thing that would kill, cripple or disfigure a person in real life. The amount of times Ash has been electrocuted or burned is too many to list, as well has Team Rockets ""blasting off again"" only to be safe and sound for the nest episode. Now you could say ""**Oh, this is just slapstick humour for comedic affect**"". It still doesn't change the fact that it happens. Slapstick comedy or not, humans in the Pokemon world show clear invulnerability to Pokemon attacks. So there is no reason why a non-human animal wouldn't have this same kind of protection.

Still not convinced? Raichu's Pokedex entry says

&gt;Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint.

The key word here being **FAINT**, not **DIE**.

# My theory

I looked at this list of animals and I noticed a pattern.

[Animals in the Pokémon world - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia (bulbagarden.net)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Animals_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world)

We can group animals into three different catagories: **Confirmed animals** (animals we know for a fact exist in the Pokemon world), **Cryptic animals** (ones that are heavily implied to exist, but not confirmed) and **Implied animals** (animals that are only reference vaguely)

**Confirmed Animals:**

* Fish
* Insects
* Worms
* Crustaceans
* Clams and Oysters
* Coral
* Varies lesser sea invertebrates (starfish, sea anemones ect)
* Frogs (one appears on Oddish's Trading Card)
* Small birds (one appears on Weepinbells Trading Card, they are also, in the Anime they are heard in the background sometimes)

**Cryptic Animals** (explanations in brackets)

* Mice (get mentioned way too many times to be a passing reference. Also, the Gastly from ""The Ghost of Maidan's Peak"" once turned into a giant mousetrap)
* Cats (again, get mentioned an awful lot. Even Catnip is mentioned)
* Mongoose (The Maidan's Peak Gastly turns into one to scare Ekens, showing both these Pokemon at least know what a mongoose is)
* Cows (beef appears, although it could come from anywhere. Also Ash once dressed up in a cow costume, showing he, Misty and the people who made the costume know what a cow is)
* Chicken (get mentioned a lot. Also, cooked chicken appears, but this could be anything)
* Deer (what looks like a deer head can be seen in ""The Tower of Terror"" but it's not acknowledged or detailed, so it could be anything)
* Tigers (a picture of one is seen in ""Riddle Me This"")
* Swans (Meowth wears a rubber swan in ""The Misty Mermaid"")
* Seagulls (Miranda from the first movie apparently talks to them, though they are not seen)
* Elephants (get mentioned in Raichu and Gastly's Pokedex entries)
* Chameleons (Lickitung's entry)
* Whale (a whale-like creature that appears in the Manga ""The Electric Tale of Pikachu"")
* Turkey (Snorlax eats a frozen turkey in one of Pokemon Newspaper Strips)

**Implied Animals** (explanations in brackets)

* Rabbits (rabbits are not named, but appear as plushies and as pictures)
* Bears (same matter as rabbits)
* Owls (One Bird Keeper says  ""I go everywhere with my Noctowl. We’re gonna show you **owl** best! Ha!"")
* Polecats (Somebody calls Team Rocket polecats in one episode)
* Ducks, Horses and Giraffes (appears as toys in ""Tower of Terror"")
* Chipmunks (Get mentioned in one episode)
* Basically, ever animal I haven't mention that is a Pokemon category, like Turtles, foxes ect.

# What does this mean?

With this list, you will notice a few things.

All **Confirmed Animals** are animals that are too small and weak to be used in a Pokemon battle. Like I said earlier, the Zygarde cell and core prove that there is a dividing line between what is a Pokemon and what isn't. Pokemon like Magikarp probebly only just qualifies due to have an evolution with moves. Overwise, it would likly not be a Pokemon, as it has no effective moves (over then tackle).

It should also be noted that small creatures non-superpowered fast breeding creatures must exist in order to have a stable ecosystem. I mean, if all insects are the size of small dogs, or bigger what's pollinating the flowers? And if every creature has powerful moves, how do predators effectively hunt their prey? It's too much of a gamble if their aren't any small spawning  creatures providing easy food, and every predator had to battle their prey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cryptic Animals** are a different story. For this I bring up this link:  [Disputed Pokémon - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia (bulbagarden.net)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Disputed_Pok%C3%A9mon) 

This page shows use that there are creatures that are clearly not real animals, but that are not identified as Pokemon. One of these disputed Pokemon is the alleged ""Whale"" the Manga ""The Electric Tale of Pikachu"", which as the article points out, has three sets of flippers.

My guess, is that many of the cryptic animals are actually unidentified pokemon that are eaither extinct or from an unknown region. The Mongoose could be a now extinct Kantonian varient of Yungoos or Gumshoos, Pokemon which are said to be foreign to Alola a place known for it's reginal variants of Kanto Pokemon. 

The deer head could also be an unidentified Pokemon that's eaither extinct or was obtained by the home owner outside the Kanto region.

Same principle with the elephant, tiger and swan

Cows and Chicken (and possibly Turkeys), I think might be Pokemon that have been domesticated for meat, and possibly not suitable for battle.

Now I have a confession to make. I was originally going to make this post a month ago, but now I'm glad I delayed it, thanks to **""Pokémon Legends: Arceus""** which provides more evidence for my theory. firstly, Raichu's entry in that game now mentions Copperajah in place of Indian Elephants, implying that's what these so called ""Indian Elephants"" were this whole time. This game also have reginal variants of Pokemon from outside of Sinnoh (present day Hisui) confirming the idea of local extinctions, particularly that of reginal variants. (Though this does raise the question as to why they haven't been revived, since we know they can do that in this universe)

&amp;#x200B;

As for **Implied Animals,** the only ones that have images (which I can't find, sorry) are the Rabbit, Bear, Ducks, Horses and Giraffe. Of course, these could be written off of simplified caricatures of rabbit and bear-like Pokemon, such as Nidoran and Ursaring for the rabbit and bear. Kind of like Ty Beanie Babies. 

The ""Owl"" pun could just be a short Noctowl. 

Polecat, could mean something else in the Pokemon world.

The Chipmunks could eaitehr be unidentified Pokemon, or maybe even fictional ones.

Everything else, like Mice, Cats, Turtles ect, could just be categories like Canine and Rodent. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my theory. Sorry it's so long. If there's anything I've missed, please let me know.",2

&gt;!It’s probably because I played the Pokémon mystery dungeon games but compared to the moments in some of those games where you are forced out of the main town like becoming outlaws in red and blue rescue teams and getting dragged to the future in the explorer games, getting banished in Legends Arceus didn’t really hit me that hard.!&lt;

&gt;!My best guesses as to why are that I didn’t really care about the characters in the galaxy team that much (I liked Cylenne and Akari but the professor was annoying me by this point and I didn’t really care that much for Kamado in the first place), it didn’t really change that much gameplay wise aside from where my main base was (maybe taking away my Pokemon (either the riding or the Pokemon I had on me would have worked? IDK) and aside from a couple of moments (got annoyed when the girl I helped with the bidoof problem said I couldn’t be trusted and I got a little smile from that shinx and luxio scene in the obsidian fieldlands), I didn’t really feel that much throughout the whole thing!&lt;.

&gt;!IDK, maybe I’m just older and moments like this get me more annoyed than sad now.

1463,pokemon,"So after playing PLA and BD I've remembered one of the biggest gripes I've had with pokemon for awhile, the repeatedly keep the same 6 pokemon in just about every zone to the point I'm sick of seeing them. When I first reached Mt. Coronet in PLA the first 4 different pokemon I saw where in all 3 of the other areas. I have 6 badges in BD and when I walk in the grass I don't get just the evolutions of those same 6, but occasionally 1 of the 6. In the underground it's almost a carbon copy of those 6 plus the occasional rare to make it seem different. 

I get that they are set in a region and they are supposed to have set pokemon but come on. I don't need to see them in every patch of grass in every spot on the map.

Personally I don’t want it for two reasons: I imagine it would be overpowered if implemented, especially types with a lot of resistances like Steel or not many types that resist its moves like Ghost, plus it would be hard to make it make sense within the world itself. However, I feel the concept itself is somewhat interesting. Perhaps it could be a future gimmick like Mega Evolution where you can make it so one Pokémon has their primary type in their secondary type’s slot, with any secondary type they used to have being temporarily replaced. Again though, probably still overpowered.",2

But it wasn't completely a waste because While I got leafgreen I decided to ditch doduo and trade a Charizard too to my fire red as doduo is just flying and Charizard is fire/flying. I have to say that was one of my best teams. Nidoking, venusaur, starmie, Charizard, snorlax and jolteon. Infact starmie went on to become my MVP. It was so nice having huge coverage. I defeated almost all of the E4 with it. Starmie was defeated by blue's exeggcutor. I had only venusaur that was not fainted and venusaur had to frenzy plant exeggcutor to win the league. It was such a nice experience



So had there been any instance when you wished the version exclusives system didnt exist so that you could get all the mons of that region in one single game without having to trade?",2

1481,pokemon,"Okay, we’re off to a great start with the first episode of the Indigo League series! 😁
Ash, Pikachu, Gary, Professor Oak, Misty, and Delia (Ash’s mom) all had great character introductions! I feel like they also established the Pokémon world in a way that everyone could properly understand, dropping more and more facts as the episode went on! ☺️🙏

I only started considering changes whenever Ash started trying to capture Pokémon, like the Pidgey, Rattata, and Spearow he came across. But then I realized a few things:

The reason Ash didn’t catch Pidgey and Rattata was to highlight his lack of understanding of how to properly battle and capture Pokémon, and Spearow couldn’t have been captured because you can’t replace Ash’s awesome sacrifice for Pikachu near the end of the episode! ☺️

One thing I would think about reimagining is to uncensor the “Misty Slaps Ash in the Face Scene.” For those who don’t know, the original airing of this episode in Japan had Misty slap Ash in the face for thinking that she cared about his safety rather than Pikachu’s. The was cut in the English dub because of unnecessary violence between children.

While I think the slap was ENTIRELY unnecessary, it’s interesting to think about how people would’ve reacted to this scene if it was giving the OK by 4Kids (the anime’s English dubbers at the time).

What were y’all’s thoughts on the episode? What do you think could’ve been changed and/or added to make this episode better? 
Comment below, and I’ll see you later! 😁✌️",2
1482,pokemon,"Yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of the Pokémon anime, and boy was I excited for it! Nearly 1200 episodes, 23 movies, and many manga adaptations, the Pokémon anime has come a long way every since the very first episode.

Speaking of, this momentous occasion has gotten me all nostalgic, and I’ve decided to run through the entire Pokémon anime (up to Journeys until it is finished) and reimagine (or maybe fix) any episodes that I feel deserve that treatment! 

My posts won’t really have a schedule because I’m pretty busy a lot, so I’ll just watch the episodes when I can!

What episodes would you all like to see reimagined? What things would you fix about the Pokémon anime? What things would you add? How would you change already good episodes into better ones, or how would you change bad episodes into amazing episodes? 
Answer me in the comments below! ☺️🙏",2
1483,pokemon,"Let me explain myself. Some Pokemon types give you immunity to certain statuses, environments, etc. I think it would be neat if every type had a special property like that. I was inspired by a Youtube comment with the same idea. I'm not going to copy their ideas for specific types, though. I'll come up with my own. Besides, they said things like ""bug types should be able to hold two items"", which would be ridiculous. I'm gonna list the types and my ideas for special properties. If I think I need to explain it, I'll do it.

\-Normal: any damaging move used against them repeatedly will gradually lose power. For example, the power of Flamethrower would go from 90, to 80, to 70, etc. The counter resets every time the opponent uses a different move. Normal types are probably the most adaptable of all types (just look at all the TMs they can learn), so I think adapting to the opponent's moves makes sense for them. Don't worry, not all properties will be as complicated as this one.

\-Fighting: their attack can't be lowered by the opponent's moves. 

\-Flying: any Flying type move they use has the added effect of ""10% chance to raise the user's speed"". It's unaffected by Serene Grace. All that wind is gonna speed you up.

\-Poison: they already have it.

\-Ground: they're already immune to Sandstorm, but Rock types have that property plus having their Special Defense boosted while's it's active. It's only fair that Ground types also get something. They're immune to moves that would displace them (forced switching, Sky Drop, Telekinesis, etc.) They'll stay grounded, no matter what.

\-Rock: they already have it.

\-Bug: Priority moves go down one number when used against them. A lot of bugs in real life have borderline 180 degree vision. Good luck catching them off guard.

\-Ghost: they already have it.

\-Steel: they have both the immunity to Sandstorm and the immunity to being poisoned. They don't need more properties.

\-Fire: they already have it.

\-Water: contact moves used against them do 10% less damage. You try throwing a punch underwater. And no, I'm not counting Rain Dance. That affects Water type moves, not Water type Pokemon.

\-Grass and Electric: they already have it. I saved myself a line of text.

\-Psychic: can't be confused or infatuated. A smart Pokemon can see through the opponent's tricks.

\-Ice: they already have it.

\-Dragon: any Dragon type move they use has the added effect of ""10% chance to raise the user's attack"". It's unaffected by Serene Grace. I have no good explanation, this one is just to fill up the list.

\-Dark: they're already immune to Prankster-assisted moves, but I feel like that's too situational. Not that many Pokemon have Prankster. I wanna make is so that Dark types can't lose their items from the opponent's moves (Pluck, Knock Off, etc.) A thief believes everybody steals, after all.

\-Fairy: When they attack the opponent with a Fairy type move, the chances of their move's side effect activating goes up by 10%. It makes it easier of them to curse their opponents. This doesn't stack with Serene Grace; the ability simply replaces the property.

If you read through my wall of text, thank you. What do you think? Do you have any ideas of your own?",2
1484,pokemon,"alot of people hate the finale of the kalos league with ash losing to alan with most people sitting that he had a severe type advantage with his water type greninja against alans charizard. but thats kinda not fair since if you recall for the bulk of the fight charizard was in mega form at the time and transformed into a dragon type, this grants it some resistance to water moves slightly evening the playing field. i know it was disapointing due to ads tricking us into thinking ash would win but the actual type advantage thing is totally unjustifieda as charizard was part dragon.",2

1488,pokemon,Aight bois and girls its time to talk big. I'm sure all of you have bit into this subject one way or the other but I wanna know from all of you... What do you think the history of the world from the beginning to until now would be like if Mons were real? Would we be able to go cross country adventuring just like in the anime? If so at what age? What professional category would Pokémon training be in? And if not a trainer what profession would you rather have?,2
1489,pokemon,"I originally wrote this in a comment, but I think it's worthy of a post.

&gt;Reasoning: if you spend enough time in the tall grass and get your starter to Lv.60, it doesn't matter how ""hard"" the game is supposed to be. You'll just steamroll, as proven by speedruns.

My concept for an easy-to-implement challenge mode is having a setting where Pokemon's stats don't increase with the level. Instead, both Lv.1 and Lv.100 Pokemon will have stats calculated at Lv.50 (using the EVs, nature and IVs as usual). Levels will only be used to unlock new moves and evolve, and as a sign of how long you have trained your Pokemon.

This way:

* the gamemode is easily implemented

* the game is always a challenge and there's no way to just ""cheese"" the opponent 

* every single battle, even against Youngster Joey, will feel like a competitive game, just like in the anime.

* you get to use your Lv.100 pokemon without feeling bad about breezing through/not enjoying the game.

* No real need for traded pokemon to not obey you anymore.

&gt;this wouldn't require much in terms of further balance.

You may think: ""if wild pokemon are always at your level, running away will be harder"". 

This will finally give Pokemon with Runaway a reason to exist, and this applies to the Pokedoll and Smoke Ball items, too.

Also, routes with multiple trainers may trick you into thinking they'd be too hard. Luckily, varying your team's composition would be a lot easier, and since from SwSh onwards you always use pokemon from your boxes,this will only incentivize you using pokemon that aren't in your usual main party, as you can switch at any moment to that one Venonat in box 5, and it will be ready to fight.

I hear people in the back saying that the Pokemon League would be a nightmare.

It wouldn't. You'll still have access to your usual healing items.

It will be like having to fight 5 champions instead of only one, but after all, isn't that why they call them ""Elite""?",2
1490,pokemon,"Hello!

My favorite Pokemon is Floette so I was wondering what real world flower people thought would most closely resemble the flower that Floette holds.  I’m not looking for Eternal Floette, but if anyone else is interested feel free to share! 

I was looking around but couldn’t find an answer of what the flower could have been based on. I looked up native flowers to France but the closest thing in my opinion was the nasturtium.

I wanted to reference them in an art project I was planning on working on so any help is appreciated! 

I’m looking through a list of flowers and here are some I personally think are close (may update as I go through more lists): 
Alyssum
Big Flax
Buttercup

1494,pokemon,"Frequently, anyone other than the party trying to catch pokemon without a character are, especially legendaries,, is a horrible person, but if it's a main character it is fine. Why is this? I.e. Goh trying to catch Suicune or Zapdos or Lugia or mew is fine, but nobody else except maybe during a raid battle. I find it really strange. Like, yeah the guys were abusive toward suicune, but their methods of baiting it out were valid. Same with Kyogre in Sun and Moon. This happens with a lot of wild pokemon too.

1496,pokemon,"With how older Pokémon have been getting new evolutions again recently, I've been thinking about what other Pokémon would benefit from new evolutions.  

So, let's see what cool Fakémon we can design!

The rules: 

A) No branched evolutions, only new stages, i.e; a 3rd stage for Pokémon that currently only have 2 stages, or a 2nd stage for a Pokémon that doesn't yet evolve.  So no Eeveelutions, new Hitmons, etc. 

B) The Pokémon getting an evolution MUST have a BST of 500 or lower.  So no Snorlax or Lapras evos.

C) The Pokémon getting an evolution MUST be NU or lower on Smogon's tier list for Sword &amp; Shield. If it's not available in Sword &amp; Shield, then it must be NU or lower in Sun &amp; Moon. So no Skarmory or Mimikyu evos.

D) Art of your Fakémon designs IS welcome, but not required.  A detailed description (typing, stats, moveset, appearance, etc) is just fine.

E) The Pokémon CANNOT already have a Mega Evolution.  Sorry Altaria and Pinsir.

F) Since Gen 9 is coming very soon, ANY generation from 1 through 8 is fair game.

1499,pokemon,"Ash should not have won based on worldbuilding, techniques and what we were shown and this could be how they plan on writing Cynthia's loss.

When they talked about pitting an elite 4 against Ash, I was already worried about how they would portray it. Alain beat Ash's most trained pokemon, Pikachu and Greninja with his Charizard and **then got beaten by an Elite 4 of Kalos** with little effort. An elite 4 is supposed to be a well trained, powerful trainer that has numerous techniques, and tricks and overall has pokemon capable of taking and dealing a reasonable amount of damage. They are quite literally part of the top 5 of the region and some has kept that title for years if not decades. So now how is it that Ash can grab two new pokemon that are hardly as trained as his Pikachu or Greninja (Dracovish is hardly trained at all!) and he is able to beat what I'm assuming is a top 3 elite 4 of Kalos?

It was evident that the writers had activate the strongest plot armor they had in order to let Ash win this battle that he does not deserve to win. Im all up for him growing and winning really good battles, but it has to be done in a believable way. He uses Dracovish instead of Dragonite or one of his better trained pokemon from other regions against and elite 4, for fighting type instead of making it a more narratively sensical battle by having a Steel/Fighting Mega Lucario go up against the Fairy/Dragon Mega Altaria he used Sirfetch'd. Visually you can tell that Drasna should've won by the power of her pokemon's attacks and her skillful training. Drasna fights with actual strategy and set up moves while all Ash did was spammed the x button. How does sirfetch tank like 3-4 powerful attacks, nearly faint (it really shouldve already fainted) gets put back in the ball and somehow has enough power to tank 3 more powerful hits, but the MEGA ALTARIA Who only actually got ""hit"" with watergun and a not very effective meteor assault against a +6 defense is taken down just like that? Dracovish has been slammed with dragon and fairy moves and constantly shakes it off with no issue. How is this a battle fans are expected to agree with? They are quite literally breaking world-building and continuity as well as applying unbelievable amounts of plot armor just to have Ash win a fight he clearly should not have. I'm not saying Ash doesnt have the skills and pokemon to beat an elite 4 in a 2 v 2 battle, but he clearly weren't using the team or signature on the fly techniques that would make it deserving. Dont even get me started on how the ranking system works, idk how Ash can fly from 15 to 9 like nothing from one battle. My biggest fear right now, is that they will do the same thing for Cynthia.",2

I decided to give crossfire X (campaign) a try yesterday and honestly I only did it because of the bad reviews it got, I was curious to see how bad it is

So I went in having very low expectations, I expected a bad game I’d play for a minute then immediately turn off to how bad it is. But that wasn’t I got

The game wasn’t impressive or great by any means, it had a few flaws, but it definitely wasn’t as bad as all the reviews made it to be

I played and completed the “Operation Catalyst” campaign which is included with game pass and the game was alright. The overall quality was mediocre but still enjoyable enough for me to keep playing it

I like the variety of weapons it had and the weapon sounds and animations were cool too. I also really liked the slowing time down mechanic, it was a fresh mechanic I don’t see in many games nowadays that is just fun to use. I also liked how all the guns had a tight hip fire spread, really enjoyed no scoping enemies with a sniper from far away. But that’s where my compliments end lol, the only thing I had fun with was shooting people and that’s all

As for the flaws, well it definitely have a few. Let’s start with the story, it’s really REALLY generic and boring and all over the place. The characters are extremely uninteresting to the point I don’t even remember any of their names and I just completed the game. I stopped paying attention to it halfway through because I knew the campaign was short and it wasn’t getting any better. 

The plot resolves about finding a character that you only see for like 5 minutes at the beginning of the game then he gets shot and everyone think he’s dead and you think he’s not and you gotta save him blah blah. Its just your typical generic good solider guy vs bad solider guy story that we’ve seen over and over again. But there’s some sci-fi elements thrown in that kinda reminded me of Crysis but they don’t explain any of them since it’s supposed to be revealed in the other campaigns 

The only compliment I can give the story is that it had some cheesy moments. Without spoiling anything it just had some serious dialogue that I laughed at because it was ironically cheesy. You know, over the top military stuff

And idk how in the hell is the game is series S|X enhanced. I played the campaign at 30 FPS on Xbox series X and the graphics were terrible. I couldn’t find anything in the options to change graphics modes

Also I haven’t experienced any actual bugs or glitches but the hit detection and controls are bad. Only half of your bullets hit the enemies most of the time when you’re firing at them which I think is because of the terrible recoil patterns. There’s no actual recoil you have to control the gun just jumps up and down by itself and your bullets miss even if the gunsight is still covering their bodies. With some guns you can’t even see anything while firing due to how fast they jump up and down by themselves

And aiming controls wasn’t that great, aiming just felt off in the game regardless of how much I tried to mess with the settings. 

So overall, I think the game isn’t really bad, but mediocre at best. Is it worth a try? On gamepass, for sure. You get like 3-4 hours of fun shooting things and then when you’re done you delete the game and never touch it again. It’s still a decent experience, atleast from my own experience 

I think the reviews it got are a bit harsh. 2/10 IGN, 39 metascore, 3.2 user score. I don’t think it’s THAT horrible, I’d personally give it a 5/10",3

Looking online, I’ve only found that the storage chip goes up to 2tb and it’s $400.  Are there any external drives that will work with the Series X?  These games are so big, I can’t justify spending that kind of $ for maybe 15 games, before the storage runs out.

1544,xboxone,"So I have an Xbox account that I've had for years ever since I got my first Xbox. I have countless hours on many games and over a thousand dollars spent on multiple games at this point. And I've lost it. Despite having every single piece of information to said account.

Xbox has locked me out of it for ""security reasons"" I know the email, I know the password. The catch is that I went to basic training and infantry school for the Army about 7 months ago and Xbox decided to lock my account while I was there. Sadly I don't have access to the actual yahoo email anymore, as Yahoo has ALSO locked me out of my email account despite the fact I know the password to it for more security reasons. And wants me to enter a 8+ year old phone number I don't have to verify it.

So I went through the account recovery procedures on Xbox and I have entered EVERYTHING. Perfect address, all my card informations I ever used to buy anything, my gamertag perfectly, my DOB, even down to the SERIAL ID ON MY ACTUAL XBOX I USED IT ON.

Every single time (5+ tries at this point) it says there isn't enough information, despite I have entered everything correct, I'm 100% positive on it. Address? I live there. Card information? I'm holding it in my hand. Xbox network ID? I'm literally looking at it. Gamertag? The account is still on my Xbox I'm looking at it.

I tried support multiple times and they didn't help at all, pointing me to the account recovery that at this point wants a DNA sample, drug test, my birth certificate, high school diploma, tax return, and sacrifice of my first born son.

Is there anything else I can do to get my 4 year old account back?",3

1676,xboxone,"I am a bit late finding this out but I did not realise the USB ports on the Xbox One are permanently on even in full shutdown mode, I have always had the external drive in back facing forward so never saw the light on the front.

So I was just wondering if the external HDD that are advertised as being for Xbox can cope with being powered on all the time for years compared with a ""normal"" external HDD?

Bit of back story, I bought 2 WD 4TB external drives at the same time and after about 2.5 years the one on the Xbox stopped working where the one on the PS4 was fine (and still is a couple of years later).

The faulty one I got replaced under the guarantee and now use that newer one as my data backup, I have a really old WD 2TB on the Xbox One that used to be the data backup drive and the one that used to be connected to the PS4 is now unused as I have a PS5 with an added external SDD which I use more.

I would probably not think about updating my Xbox to a Series X till the ""pro"" version comes  out for no other reason than to get the upgrade out of sink with the PS5 upgrade cycle.",3

1. add the x 3 12month xbox gold to your account
2. Sign up to the ultimate pass and skip the renewal offer (because 3 years is the cap)
 

And off I go, BUT what if I already created and account with xbox and used the ultimate $1.00 thing already?

Must I create a new account or can I just work off the existing account I created (the one I'm currently using for gaming on xbox/PC).

What I read so far is:
1.Turn off renew membership via the Microsoft website
2. Wait till my membership expires for GPU 
3. Add the x3 gold pass subscription giftcards in
4. Go on Microsoft's website and select do the $1.00 for 1 month (it won't work as I've already done the $1.00 renewal)
5. It should ask me somewhere during the prompts if I want to ""upgrade"" my gold pass to GPU and done! 

Obviously rejecting and renewal offer they have as it will push me over the 12 months.

Hope to get an answer for the question:
Will it still work if I've already done the xbox GPU $1.00 thing and get charged a full month only ($16) or whatever it is.

Are there any games beyond FPS titles where you work together to accomplish something?

I don’t think it was necessarily designed with that in mind, it was just really hard to do all of it on your own and playing with two people working together was a lot of fun.

I replaced it with Xbox One S because I was dumb enough to buy digital games on Xbox store. Xbox One had no true exclusives like PlayStation, no VR, even lost Kinect support(there weren't any good Kinect games anyway). Most of the games were stuttering or lagging.

I'm trying to play a co-op game that does not have ""invert Y axis"" in the settings. I use inverted, my girlfriend does not. When using the xbox accessories app, it seems to set any profile changes to both controllers. Any way to run an ""inverted"" profile on just one controller with this app?

1. Can I duplicate the game data so it is stored on both Xbox's?  
2. If not, how can I transfer the data from the OG Xbox to the Series X?  
I imagine its something to do with moving as much as I can onto the 1TB hard drive, and then safely unplugging this and plugging it into the Series X, then download what is on the hard drive onto the Series X, and then repeat once more. Can someone validate that for me? Or is there a better way to do it?

1832,xboxone,"Hi everyone!

So I'm currently thinking about purchasing an Xbox Series S, because it looks like a really good value at 300€. 

I've been gaming on a PC my entire life and never owned a console, so there are a few things I'm not sure about.

I'm not a fan of subscriptions so I'll probably skip Xbox Gold and Game Pass. I heard that you don't need Xbox Gold to play free games online, is that true? Can I play Rocket League for example without the ""multiplayer subscription""?

How is the overall user experience? If I plug in a keyboard and mouse will I be able to navigate Youtube and Twitch smoothly? 

I'm also curious about game cross-compatibility. I purchased Forza Horizon 4 on Steam and was required to log in with a Microsoft account. If I open the Xbox app on my phone, I can see Forza Horizon 4 in my list of games. Does that mean I will be able to play FH4 without needing to purchase it again?

What are your feelings about the Series S? What are your experiences with it like? Does it stand up to it's hype about performance? 

I'm happy to hear all your feedback! If you think purchasing it is a good idea or whether I should just keep playing on PC (which I don't intend on stopping btw, just felt like playing a few chill games on the couch lately).

Thank you to everyone who decides to read and comment on this post!",3

Can I change the graphics quality like I do on pc if the FPS is bad ?

1895,xboxone,"Hello, I have a pretty good home theater and I recently added an Arcam amplifier because the Denon receiver really couldn't make the Bowers and Wilkins speakers breath as they should. 

I added Amazon Music Unlimited to re-evaluate the system because Tidal through Plex is not MQA quality and it turns out that Amazon sounds better. I listen to music in stereo through the tower speakers. 

Upon firing up Amazon, I was a little stunned how much better an Amazon HD playlist sounded than Plex with Tidal. It dawned on me that I had set the HDMI out to Headphones in the Xbox settings and then I thought something else has to be different because I already evaluated the system after the new amplifier was added a couple of weeks ago, so I selected every other HDMI option and all of them sounded diminished and much less alive or robust than when I had headphones for HDMI selected. 

Now, I am spoiled and do not want to listen to it any other way but realistically that is not the best idea because I have an in-ceiling Atmos system. 

I am thinking that the signal may be boosted through the HDMI output when headphones are selected so one can be more competitive when wearing headphones? 

I cross referenced the Amazon app from my TV, but it was lesser as well, but slightly better than the Xbox for Netflix and comparable to my Netflix app in the stand alone Blu-ray player. Maybe I need a pre-amp, I'm not sure but I have been missing out on the systems ability for a couple of years already without a separate amplifier.

Since the Series S|X Update for Cyperpunk 2077 was released, I was heading back into the Game and I realize that the aiming specially for Controller is really bad. After experimenting with the settings I found the solution. After you turn off all additional sensitivity settings in the Advanced settings you configure your ADS Settings with the normal horizontal and vertical sensitivity if you find a Sensitivity that you comfortable with you start putting in the advanced setting the horizontal and vertical rotation boost this setting will not affect the ADS Sensitivity and you should put the horizontal and vertical rotation at the same value or it becomes weird and here you go now you can enjoy Cyperpunk 2077 on console without weird or trash Aiming problems   I put a Link for a Screenshot as an example for what I mean it is in German but I can describe it for you guys 8 and 4 is my Sensitivity and the two 1.00 is my rotation bonus you can copy those settings If you want but a little disclaimer it is more for the low Sensitivity players

She's spent the last few months getting into Minecraft and building some great things that have really surprised me, as I've not played it in years.

She's been mostly playing on my Series X but a few times played on my One X. A few weeks ago, she realised things she built on the One X, wasn't in the world on the Series X, despite the world ""syncing"" to the cloud. So she just continued building on the Series X. I've now brought the Series X into my office and set the One X in the living room, but again, despite the world saying it's up to date it's missing a month's worth of building. So I deleted the local save, but it kept syncing the ""out of date"" world.  After removing her profile, it then said the world is corrupt and to play it on a working console for a while, and let it sync. I did that for around 15 mins, quit and said it synced. Which again, didn't work. It seems it was in such a state, that it didn't save to the cloud properly. And since you can no longer backup a save to USB anymore, delete from everywhere would have meant losing her world.  Now, it shows as corrupt on both consoles and can no longer load.

Either the ability to backup saves or delete cloud only data would have easily resolved this, and I've not had the heart to tell them they've lost all the building they've done.  I've reached out to Microsoft to see if there's anything they can do, but I'm highly doubtful anything can be.",3

1924,xboxone,"**Every** review of the game on Xbox right now is 1 star and asking the question of: *""How do I play the game now that I've bought it?""*  


The trick is, GTA V series S/X is **actually GTA Online**. You need to run GTA Online to play ""story mode"" (single player) GTA V.   


After one hour, I figured it out. Here's how:  


The game is **not** a free upgrade. You need to purchase the Series S/X version to get 4k, ray tracing, and 60 FPS. Right now it is in the store for half off, which means you can buy the ""story mode"" (single player) for $10, and GTA Online for $10. There is also a bundle to buy them together for $20.  


Here is where things get tricky. I bought both, so I'm not sure of what happens if you try to play story mode (single player), but do not have GTA Online.  


1. Purchase GTA V Series S/X **and** GTA Online.
   1. Can someone confirm what happens if you purchase **only** GTA V series S/X and see which title actual appears in your library?
2. Your library will now have GTA Online. Launch that.
3. Once GTA Online launches, you will have the option to select GTA Online **OR** GTA V Story Mode (single player)

  
Why they would hide the single player game inside multiplayer, I have no idea.  


**How to transfer your saves from GTA V -&gt; GTA V Series S/X**  


1. Launch your old version of GTA V
2. Load your latest save
3. In the options menu you'll now have the opportunity to upload **one** save to Rockstar
4. Upload your save
5. Launch the Series S/X version of GTA V (follow steps above)
6. In the settings menu, you can download/load your save from Rockstar",3

1946,xboxone,"Apologies for the long winded post, but I'm frustrated with the support I've received from Microsoft on this product. Timeline below:

1. I received the Elite Controller Series 2 as a Christmas gift in December 2021. The left bumper of the controller that had come with my Series X had become almost unusable, so I was excited to have a fully functioning controller again.
2. I began using the controller about mid-January. Roughly two weeks after I first began using the controller, it stopped turning on. I plugged it into the charger, left it charging overnight, tried plugging it into my laptop per recommendation of submitting a question on the Xbox help site, but it wouldn't turn on
3. A few days after that, I randomly tried turning it on again and it worked with no issues for a few games of Overwatch. I thought it was a weird error and was hoping the issue was behind me. After about 45 minutes of play time, the controller remained on, but disconnected from the Xbox and I received the ""please reconnect your Xbox controller"" screen in-game. Nothing I tried would reconnect it and I ended up getting kicked out of the game and a 15 minute comp ban lol
4. At this point, I decide I'm going to submit a warranty claim so I register my controller with my Xbox account. I click through the steps online until I get to the part where I'm required to pay for shipping and supply packaging to ship this controller in. The site also mentions that the customer must ensure packaging is sufficient so that the controller is not damaged in transit.
5. In early February I called the support line at this time to ask if there was any way to receive a prepaid label since I thought it was a bit odd that I'd have to pay out of pocket for service on a controller that only functioned for 2 weeks. After about an hour and 45 minutes on the phone with support, and being transferred to a supervisor, I was told that they were going to check if FedEx could pick up the package for me, and since I mentioned that this was my only fully functioning controller, they were going to check if they could send me a complimentary standard controller as well. I thought this was a generous offer and I thanked them for this. I got off the phone after being told I'd hear back from them shortly with an update.
6. Two weeks went by and I had heard nothing from Microsoft. During this time I was also packing for an apartment move, which will be relevant shortly. I received a phone call from the original support rep I had spoken to, and she let me know that they heard back from their internal team, and not only was my complimentary controller not approved, but FedEx would not be picking up the controller either, and I am back to square one, having to pay for shipping and packaging myself.
7. I told her I understood that she's just enforcing the policy but the amount of time this has taken, and my controller has been unusable, is frustrating, and she let me know that she would expedite my service as soon as I could send the controller in. We went through the steps again of collecting my info, and I informed her that I would be moving apartments soon so I'd need to know the timeframe for the return, as my shipping address would be changing depending on when the controller is shipped back. She let me know that she couldn't provide a date, and once the order is created they have no way of changing the shipping address. She suggested she call back at the beginning of March when I moved, so we could process the order then.
8. That was roughly mid-February, and I have not heard anything from Microsoft since

Alamo Drafthouse had an early screening tonight of the 2-part premier. I had heard bad things and wasn't impressed with the trailers, but figured it would be kinda fun.

And it was!

I went in not expecting much and was actually pleasantly surprised. Yes, there were plenty of flaws, but none of them were deal breakers for me. It felt very much in the same ballpark as *The Expanse*, though not as grounded or personal (yet) in terms of the universe. Acting was comparable and it felt similar in scope, though Halo clearly had more money for effects (which were excellent for the most part). Pacing was good, sounds and sets were great, and there are a lot of questions I'm just interested enough to care about answering.

It clearly isn't the best sci-fi ever (or even recently). But it's good enough that I'm gonna see if anyone in my family has a P+ account. If not, I actually might sign up. It looks like it could scratch that ""sci-fi action flick"" itch that Boba really didn't.

I know that if you are split screening both of you can be in a party, but only one mic will work. Currently my gf just sits next to me and our friends can hear her well enough through my mic, but we would like her to use her own headset for the mic/directional audio. Are there any work arounds for this using discord or something?

Some additional information is I have Turtle Beach Stealth 600 and my gf uses the $50 Xbox headset that came bundled with my Xbox One S in like 2014. We both have Discord accounts but so far we haven't been able to get the mic to pick up our audio, so we have to use party audio which still doesn't pick up the second players mic.

2002,leagueoflegends,"One, two, three, four, the rows of lanterns turn off, one by one. They stumble, blinded by the lack of mortal light. But they shall be enlightened by my work, I shall make them see! They scream, challenging a spirit, an assassin, one who is not there. When I shoot, they dance. They panic, and stumble about, feeling for something, but touching nothing, and stumble into my traps, so intricately laid. This shall be the paragon of my works, and it will only be the first.

They called me… call me a killer, a demon, a madman. All artists are mad, I just chose to put a more… creative flair to my madness, and I share it freely with the world, to show what is within all of us. I long to share the similarities all of us bear, under all the masks and lies, in four beautiful strokes! 

But before I do, I do take my time, examining my victim caught in quite the bind. After all, death shouldn’t be quick, it should be an opera. Alas, this stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it! “Now, let’s start the show, shall we?” They always expect me to some sort of monster, I wonder what they think when they hear me. I ready myself, my heart beating quickly; the euphoria of killing is quite a rush.

The first cuts the skin, cleanly separating the skin from all the tendons and muscles laying underneath. There is a certain art to it, like fishermen cutting and gutting fish at the slaughter docks. My victims scream. Quiet! And they do, as their lungs no longer have the capacity to, their voices hoarse from the spectacle. My masterpiece has rendered them speechless, as it should.

The second stroke, cuts finely between the muscle, into their blood veins pulsing underneath. To have a scab on my perfection simply will not do! A fine cut, a spray of blood! It’s quite amusing and intriguing to me how one small capillary can send one healthy man spiraling unto death. Like one quiet note, sparking a beautiful nighttime sonata, the loss of blood always looks so strangely beautiful, but my work isn’t done yet.

The third, rearranges their bones into a more pleasing, beautiful shape. It supports the skin I have cut away earlier, so now they lay in loose flaps on the surface I have deigned worthy as my stage, for their body is my canvas, and I shall create my masterpiece however I see fit. Their screams have since gone silent, no energy or sanity left to scream, though their eyes still move in agony. But I am not done, art takes time, and time is something I’m not afraid to take all of what I need.

The fourth… four. Four is such a potent number in what it brings. Four quarter notes, but there are only 5 fingers on the piano, only five notes that play when one practices. What song only uses 4 notes when they could use five instead? Five is perfect… but four is a measure of imperfection in art, four is chaotic. Four… to the untrained listener unnerves them, it makes them afraid, fearing what will come when the end comes. They do not know there is no end. To me, four is perfection.

The fourth is not a cut, I am not so shallow. An artist must think outside his box. To be perfection, he must reach beyond his limits, his mortal limits, and I am such perfection. After all, art requires a certain cruelty, and I am all too content to supply such a demand. I lay a small flower in where his chest cavity used to be, a farewell gift, so to speak. When they come searching, looking, he will bloom, like a flower in the dawn. 

My trademark, a lotus blossom, adorns each of my masterpieces. The skin and bones make up the petals, while the muscle and blood become the pistil center. When it blossoms and all that remains are corpses that lay dying, one might say they have become the seeds of terror. Regardless of what remains after it is all over, there is always one message. The Lotus Blossom has returned.",4

1. Its at NRG stadium, the largest venue for a LCS finals ever.

2. Tickets went on sale pretty late in the split, only becoming available last week of LCS regular season play.

3. They were quite a bit more expensive than previous LCS Final tickets, cheapest prices being 120 for 2 days and 70 for just 1 day.


Well with almost 2 weeks until finals the venue is looking pretty empty for a finals weekend.  I would say about 2/3rds of 2 day tickets have been sold and about 1/2 of the 1day tickets have been sold. If this stays the same what would be the main reason why the venue couldnt fill up?

not talking about chat and feeders.ppl here literally play the game against their team and i guess it brings joy to them.

one would simply stand back and press ctr4 emojis on 2v2 situation until the mate dies. would get his kill if the enemy in low health if not would just fall back.

during 5v5 i see ppl intentionally saving skills for the last shot so they get better kda than others. this ruins the battle and leads to defeat 90% of the time. at the end someone will have 9/2/3 but have the least damage done.

would never interfere if they see no kill is guaranteed for them.

my kda is more important than victory/defeat of the the team.

even in event mode such as one for all, would intentionally pick champions that can never win. ex. yumi, soraka.

It's possible i like to play with louder volume than most as well as use headphones. I play auto attacking champions and like to hear every auto as it helps with timing auto attack resets and orb walking. I actually move the screen because if the blastcone is on the edge of the screen or not on the screen when it goes off the volume of it goes down.

2041,leagueoflegends,"Hi all, I’m looking for a way to disable or change the killstreak notifications like “triple kill” and “legendary.” I don’t find them adding any information to my game that I don’t get from the normal elimination notifications. Ideally I’d be able to disable the announcer voice lines for these as well as I find they obviously pop up the most often in team fights when people are getting lots of kills, and I find them distracting.

Searching around I found a few UI mods and other jankier ways of doing this, but they’re all more than 5 years old so I was hoping someone here could provide me with updated information. 

If it’s not possible to eliminate specific pop ups, is there a way to completely eliminate the on screen pop ups and announcer lines? I really don’t find them useful and would like to customize my UI this way if possible.

2054,leagueoflegends,"*Passive: Stability and Form*
When Gang Quan attacks an enemy, he gains a stack of chakra, gaining 2.5% attack speed, maxing at 20 stacks. If he hits an enemy champion with an ability, he gains 5 stacks of Chakra. 

*Q: Wind Rider*
Active: Dashes to a target enemy. Upon collision, Gang Quan will immediately dash to the closest enemy nearby him (think melee range.) He will continue dashing into up to 5 enemies, or until he hits an enemy champion. When he hits the last enemy or a champion, he will root everyone in a small area around him (think karma q). The duration of the root decreases by 10% for every enemy he dashed into.

*W: Crater Blow*
Active: Empowers the next auto attack to have increased range and deal significant damage. When this attack is used, Gang Quan will be unable to auto attack for a short duration. This ability’s cooldown and debuff are refreshed when using Wind Rider or Meteor Slam.

*E: Meteor Slam*
Active: Dashes in a target direction, unable to pass through terrain. If he collides with an enemy champion, he will slow them, leap into the air, and slam down into a large aoe a second later.

*R: Thousand Hands*
Active: Unleashes a flurry of punches over 2 seconds in a target direction, one punch for each stack of chakra. If an enemy is hit by at least one punch, they are suppressed for the remaining duration. Each punch after the first will deal decreasing damage, until the last punch, which deals execute damage and knocks enemies back.

Gang Quan would be a jungle primarily who could fit into a lane. His goal in a fight would be to land either Q or E on an enemy carry and burst him down. He seems a bit overturned, however that’s made up for by the fact that if he messes up his Q or his E, he will do significantly less damage.",4

And this rage post isn’t even influenced from a loss, I’m actually 4-1 in my placements rn and have been doing fine. It’s just not fun gameplay at all.

As an adult with an actual life, I don’t want to play 150+ games to get out of Smurf queue so the system can recognize that I’m not a Smurf. It should take a computer less than a millisecond to recognize that my account level and age is not that of a Smurf. My friends are also very hesitant to even touch solo queue again because of this.

Worst of all, I could maybe look past the challenge of Smurf queue if it wasn’t the most miserable experience actually playing with these people.

2067,leagueoflegends,"Hi! This will be a comprehensive list of all the most popular gamemodes created by the LoL community.  
I wrote down the main aspects of each gamemode, so that you can check which one sounds the most fun to you and go read the full rules for it.

# ★ [Hide &amp; Seek](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/kw4jac/hide_seek/)  ★ 

The game is played by 5 Hiders and 2 Seekers  
Hiders have 5 lives and will hide in the map and try to escape Seekers  
Hiders can't attack  Seekers, but they may use their CC abilities (slow, stun, etc.) on them  
Seekers have to find and kill all the Hiders 5 times each in 40 minutes to win.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Fight Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/kw4ib1/fight_club/) ★

Played in Draft Mode in the Howling Abyss.  
The gamemode is based  on 1vs1 fights, where the 2 players will fight      until  one dies, when this  happens the next team member will go  fight     the  previous winner and so  on until a team reaches a certain   amount  of    total kills.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Draft Racing](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/p129hz/draft_race/) ★

The  objective of this game mode is to run through the jungle to die in the  enemy fountain and preventing the enemy team from doing so as well.

Managing to die in the enemy fountain will give your team 1 point, and the first team to reach a total of 10 points wins.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Find the Teemo](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/fll95n/find_the_teemo/) ★

Can be played 5vs5 or 5 vs Teemo.

In 5vs5 there is a Teemo in each team, the first team to find and kill the enemy Teemo will score a point.

In 5 vs Teemo the whole team has to find and kill Teemo before 15:00 minutes, otherwise the Teemo wins.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Dodgeball](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/fliy30/dodgeball/) ★

This game is played in the Baron pit,  it's a deathmatch where the  teams will position themselves on the  opposite sides of the pit and try  to hit the enemy champions using only  their skillshot ability, until  only one team remains alive.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Protect the BOT](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/fvg83m/protect_the_bot/) ★

The game is played 4vs4 + 1 Bot in both teams, the objective of the game is to kill the enemy Bot 10 times while protecting yours.

&amp;#x200B;

# ★ [Ultimate Bravery](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLCGM/comments/fvgeav/ultimate_bravery/) ★

A normal game but with a twist: everyone's build will be randomized using the Ultimate Bravery website.

I have been an owner of every skin in the game for some time now,  and have obtained all new skin releases by rerolling shards as you're guaranteed any skin you don't own. This, of course, includes all prestige, ultimate, and *former* gemstone skins. As I was doing my rerolls for the new Anima skins, I was outraged to see that I received a champion permanent shard in place of my Prestige Jinx/Ashen Lord Pyke skin. You could imagine my anger when I discovered they've prohibited new mythic tier skins from being rerolled for an undisclosed time after their release. This is how Riot treats their biggest financial supporters? I'm considering quitting the game after this... why should I be forced to spend hundreds more just to get the event tokens to purchase them through the event shop? Why am I not being respected for my investment and allowed to reroll **ALL** new skins, as I have been in the past.

2078,leagueoflegends,"Worlds 2021 featured 21 English-language casters, analysts, hosts and interviewers (plus four translators). The biggest event of the year naturally has a large amount of on air talent to make the event run smoothly and highlight the best from all four major regions.

This however pales in comparison to the European Masters. The main stage features [17 English-language casters and analysts](https://twitter.com/EUMasters/status/1510955103456575496), and the play-in stage with its four parallel games is brought to us in English by [The EUniverse and 25 casters and analysts](https://twitter.com/The_EUniverse/status/1510980493650853889), which with some overlap brings the total to 34 on air talent (plus any guests that might show up). And that does not take the broadcasts in 11 other languages into account which should at least double that number.

What makes it even better is the absolute breadth that these casters represent. These 34 people have previously casted 12 different regions around the world, and their experience ranges from Worlds to minor ERLs, from the LPL to amateur volunteer casts of foreign leagues with limited exposure. For some of them this is even their first time casting in English.

We've all seen how significant caster turnover can be, and by having an event like this and all the ERLs feeding into the European Masters casters are allowed to gain experience, grow and eventually settle into the LEC as regular guests and eventually permanent cast members and fan favorites.

Just to highlight them all, here is a rundown of the English-language casters featured during this event (and I've for sure missed some casting experience for a few on them):

Im glad they are considering no duo queue in ranked because almost every time someone is trying to troll everyone else its a duo. Is there a reason for that or what because its pretty ridiculous. Maybe kids wanna be cool for there friends even though most league players are 20+ I dont get it lol.,4
2094,leagueoflegends,"I expected the game to have deteriorated but not that level. Just wondering if there are other abilities on any other champion with punishments like Blitzcrank's -% movement speed after using his supercharge? I'm not talking about regular cost like mana/health/energy, but actual punishing debuffs after using a skill.",4
2095,leagueoflegends,"Ever since the sustain changes last patch Kaisa is doing much worse.  Her win rate is lower than both Yasuo and Yone. [https://u.gg/lol/tier-list](https://u.gg/lol/tier-list)

If Yasuo and Yone are going to get buffed next patch then Kaisa should too.  She's just as if not more popular than Yasuo and Yone.  I really wish we could move past the favoritism those 2 champs seem to get and help out the many other champs who need help.",4
2096,leagueoflegends,"For the past like, week, I've been kind of on a losing streak. Not a direct streak but I'm losing more than I'm winning by a lot. And I want to blame matchups but I don't know if I'm just in denial or something. It's getting to the point where I play one match, bomb, then just can't even get the (idk, courage?) to play another game and just be done for the night. Like sometimes it's an obvious matchup diff like a fucking top laning Akshan when I'm using Sett, and like earlier today it's harder for me to say like me using Sylas laning against Ekko. But I'm, sure it's just me being bad at this point but I don't want to admit it if you understand. Idk I just hate losing like anyone would so losing this much kinda taking a toll.",4
2097,leagueoflegends,perfect daven triple in one fell swoop to win the game,4

2101,leagueoflegends,poor zac cant catch a break,4
2102,leagueoflegends,Ahri ult - is it supposed to be 3 bolts or 1??,4
2103,leagueoflegends,So did they get rid of the weekly missions from previous events that give you around 200-300 tokens? Or is my game just glitched and it isn't showing for me? I don't see how any normal player who only plays a game or two a day can reach 2000 tokens without those. Would love some clarification. Thanks!,4

2106,leagueoflegends,In English he has sort of a Texan accent/southern American one. He’s sort of a stereotype of the southern libertarian who’s a bit crazy. I’m just wondering if there’s an equivalent in other languages. Does he speak in an accent or something similar?,4

2108,leagueoflegends,"I am (very) bad at lol. I play and play every day, I train alone, I play with my friends, but I can't get better.

It's hard for me to play the game like this because I'm not used to it, I really wanna play the game all my friends play, but enjoy playing it 

I keep getting 1-3 levels behind my team members and 4/2/5 score when they are 26/3/8. I know lol is a complex game and it takes time to get better, but I seem to be stuck. How can I get better at the game?",4
2109,leagueoflegends,Anybody know where I can find them? I cant seem to find anything on Twitch or Youtube and I live in Australia so watching the live streams from Europe doesn't really work,4
2110,leagueoflegends,"I don't know why but today I got the urge to draw Jinx as a Noxian instead of a Zaunite. I'm really interested in what you guys think. I decided to make her hair darker since most Noxian's have natural hair colours unlike Zaunites who seem to have all manner of hair colours. Her tattoo is supposed to look like hair but also  looks like air which I also like, I think she looks cool but i'm slightly bias. I wanted her face to look healthier and stronger since she wouldn't have to deal with the poisoned air of Zain. Her belt was supposed to have spikes but they looked weird. Her skirt and outfit are inspired by some of the really cool art from fans and the LOL wiki which I will link below. I made her hair shorter because I though it looked really cool.

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team).",4
2112,leagueoflegends,"Pretty much the title, i know that when a skinline is getting new skins usually the old skins in the same skinline are highlighted in the shop, but are the old skins on a discount or are they on regular price?",4
2113,leagueoflegends,"I don’t know if Viego is still despised in the community but I personally consider him somewhat balanced at the moment, as he lacks the damage to carry a teamfight without a good team.

That said, I think the way active items work when he possesses enemies could be better. He can’t use his own, yet he also can’t use the enemy’s even if they’re not on cooldown. There is quite an advantage in possessing a carry with say, Kraken Slayer as opposed to one with Galeforce. Alternatively, possessing a control mage mid-teamfight is usually suicide, but the Everfrost could make all the difference.

Just to reiterate, I mean only if the active isn’t on CD from the enemy already using it.",4
2114,leagueoflegends,Support actually has to be the most stale role in professional play because people feel the need to always pick Nautlius/Leona. Now Nautlius makes sense because he’s good into Zeri but the fact that teams refuse to find an answer other than handshaking Leona is so boring to me. Add into the fact that they’re nerfing moonstone and enchanters will never see the light of day in pro play. If it’s not Naut/Leona then it’s an Alistar/Braum/TK. The only enchanter who sees any play is Nami with Lucian and occasionally a Zilean/Lulu/Yuumi. I get that engage supports are flashy but when people pick the same two or three champions every game it makes me wish there was a little more diversity in this role in particular. Support has the ability like jungle to have the most diverse roster of champions played there and yet we only see a small fraction of what could be.,4
2115,leagueoflegends,"2 games in the last day legit i'm on herald and I have it down to around half hp or less. The top laner then starts spamming GANK NOW GANK NOW. I ping away and say after herald.

Well they then all in a duel without me there. Then flame and int afterwards.

RIP",4
2116,leagueoflegends,A very satisfying Corki ult,4
2117,leagueoflegends,"It's recently caught my attention half way through the game or in post game lobby (me top laner, me no look bot lane)

I see a bunch of Miss Fortunes build Liandry's with full lethality as the rest of their items. I'm noticing Muramana with Serylda's as the other two main components (correct me if I'm wrong).

Where did it come from/who started it? Does the math check out? Is the playstyle supposed to be different? I'm guessing you want to maximize the Liandry's uptime with Serylda's? Why is this better than going Eclipse or Duskblade? Do the numbers improve drastically to the point where she scales much better, even when forgoing extra AD? I'm guessing you don't lose much from the mythic passive since Liandry's gives Ability Haste which is really nice.

Someone please break down this build to me.",4
2118,leagueoflegends,"Mine is when morganas go comet and full ap sup, or when supps pick soraka/lulu/janna when I pick miss fortune.",4
2119,leagueoflegends,"I am a (mostly) free to play gamer and am interested in getting the tokens needed to get enough ME so I can get a skin, im level 54 or something right now and I play about 6 games a day or less. I already have all of the weekly challenges done.",4
2120,leagueoflegends,"No disrespect to the guy, seems like an ok dude but my man has the charisma and interviewing skills of a wet sock. Not an avid LCS watcher but when I saw the segment it seemed such a neat idea, but after listening to him I couldn't keep watching it. There is no back and forth, he asks the question and then he has zero follow up, it's like he doesn't listen to the player's analysis, he seems like he is focused on the next question which makes the whole thing so forced and with zero fluidity.  


TLDR: He has zero interviewing skills and feels like a robot asking one question and getting ready for another one regardless of what the interviewee has answered.",4
2121,leagueoflegends,"For people who don't know next patch we get phase 2 of the mythic content overhaul which means masterwork chest will be getting a reward track and using them next patch will give you free rewards.  
  
just in case cause 3 more chest on the bar to progress is still 3 more at the end of the day for people who bought the event pass.",4

Can you buy the 125 ME for 2200 Token (Anima Event Shop) and then grind for another 2200 Token and buy another 125 ME? or is it only possible to buy it once? has anyone tried it - or grinded enough in past events to know if its possible? or any rioter / twitter link on this topic - any sources/links if its possible?

thanks!",4
2125,leagueoflegends,"45% pen + 18 boots + 6 luden's + 5 mythic passive + 6 sudden impact = 45% + 35 pen.

(1-0.45)*x -35=0.  0.55x -35=0, x=63.6

Any target with 63 or less MR, has 0 MR, as long as a champ has void + luden's/protobelt.

Kaisa at lvl 12 has 35 mr. With wit's end (40 mr), your 75 mr gets shredded to 6.25 magic resist. 

The other option is going maw on kaisa.. not very appealing on ad kaisa who is reliant on crit/on-hit. With maw kaisa has 35+55=90 mr. After void+luden's kaisa is left with 14.5 mr...

Either 45% percent pen on void staff is too overpowered, or flat pen from sorc shoes is too overpowered. As adc you literally can't deny AP champs from getting pseudo true damage, whether you buy MR items or not. Going merc treads + maw is insanely low dmg on many adcs.

This scenario where you can't get enough MR kind of happens cause MR growth is weaker than armor growth. At lvl 12 kaisa has 57.5 armor and 35 magic resist. At lvl 18 the gap widens to 79 armor and 38.5 magic resist.

[Every ap champ gets access to 100% pen at 2 items (or if you buy maw 2nd it's 84% pen). I just don't like the idea that it is almost impossible to itemize magic resist vs. fed ap threats because base MR is lower than armor and void staff gives 45% pen]",4
2126,leagueoflegends,"I trained a ML ranking model on [Mage](https://www.mage.ai) 500 plat/diamond ranked games to try to find a trend that led to victory.

&amp;#x200B;

Going in, I expected to need a lot of factors, like ""total damage dealt in game,"" which champions were banned, what role that was played, which champions, etc but they had little influence on the outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

In order of importance, the factors that contributed the most to victory were:

1. Keeping deaths low
2. increasing gold earnings relative to your team
3. Getting more kills
4. Amount of gold earned in early game

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: keeping your death count low increases your chances of victory more than trying to get more kills.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I'd need 10x more plat and diamond games to make even more insightful findings (and possibly which champion picks increase your odds of victory), but for more info on how I conducted this analysis and the 5000-row raw dataset I queried, visit this [blog post](https://www.mage.ai/blog/league-of-legends-ranking-guide)!",4

FAN CHAMPION CONCEPT

Inspired by: Renata Glasc The Chem Baroness Of League Of Legends

Miriam The Poisonous Rose

Role: Support

Lore:

Miriam is a ""Loan Shark"", She was born on limarin, and still lives there. She always have been told that the generosity would lead to the wrong way by her mom, but she wanted to be good just like her sister Rose, but she decided to agree with her mom, so they would stop arguing everytime. And then se became a ""Business Woman"" so she help everyone that need, but in exchange, she get their loyalty. She created a town called Crimeville (i'm not good with names), where any criminal could redeem itself, where no cop could ever found them in there.

Passive: Loyalty

Whenever Miriam get Assistance, she creates an Companion. If only her assisted the allie, the allie who killed will have damage bonus, if another allie and her helped to kill the enemy, the allie who killed the enemy will receive some resistance bonus.

Q: Tying Rose

Miriam Throw a Rose, when hit the first unit or champion, it will give magic damage, and after 0.8 seconds it will root the target.

W: Restricted Area

Rose Creates a cone area in front of her, causing damage and slow on enemies.

E: Rose Trap

Miriam Plant a invisible Poison Rose Trap, if an enemy steps on it, The enemy get Rooted and get Poisoned.

Ultimate: Pink Rose

This Skill is only activable if she have 2+ Companions

Active: Miriam inject an Toxine called ""Pink Rose"" on all of her companions, she buff all of her Companions, giving them Attack Speed, Move Speed, Damage, and more AD/AP based on what is the allie type.

2128,leagueoflegends,"I’ve always wondered why pro play isn’t balanced completely separate from regular league, several champions don’t exist in solo queue because they’re too oppressive in pro play if they’re buffed and vice versa as well.

Now that it is nearing the end of the season, I’m wondering why Riot has never tried to have a large patch last for half a season or so in order to actually allow a meta to develop and for people to find responses to that meta.

Often times a champion is strong for 2 or 3 patches and then nerfed before people find a response to it.

If the patch cycle were something like

Spring Split - 13.1p

MSI - 13.2p

Summer Split - 13.3p

Worlds - 13.4p

And then have solo queue/normals operate on an entirely separate patch cycle, this way champions like Azir wouldn’t be gutted to the point that only the .1% of players can reasonably make him work.

I’d imagine there are plenty of people who pick up difficult champions BECAUSE they’re difficult. It allows you to strive towards mastery. Having that skill ceiling cut or even removed because *insert pro player here* has a 90% WR on that champion feels terrible.

Larger patches on a less frequent schedule seems like it would actually allow for a true meta to exist and for teams to be forced to respond to picks that are strong. It would make drafts more punishing and teams that find the secret pick before others gain a clear advantage.

Watching Jinx/Aphelios get picked for 4-6 weeks or seeing Corki/Viktor locked in yet again is getting extremely boring and I think it’s part of the reason viewership seems to be declining aside from co-streams.

Just some thoughts of mine, curious to how people of all levels of play would react, I know that balanced pro play is different from Masters+ and that’s even more different from the lower ELOs

Thanks for reading.",4

2170,leagueoflegends,"I'll be starting a new weekly series where I talk about which champs need help and which champs need nerfed.  Every Monday I'll be talking about the state of the meta and what needs to happen.

Buffs

Aphelios, Ryze, Renekton, Thresh and Gwen champs are just straight  trash right now.  That said I think he won't be seeing buffs, due to tardo games caring too much about pro play.

Kaisa the removal of Ravenous hunter has hurt her badly causing her to lose 1.5% WR, I'm talking about her bot lane win rate which is now 48%.  This has nothing to do with Kaisa mid which is a 44% troll pick that's being played quite a bit right now due to the rampant Faker fan boys.  My suggestion is reverting the Q CD nerfs from last season since this will mean much more bot than it will in mid lane.

Varus the on hit version of Varus should be buffed he's a high skill champ when played on hit instead of lethality.  I think the hard part will be finding a way to buff on hit and make sure the low skill lethality build doesn't take over the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Nerfs

Veigar Champ is super easy to play and super OP at a 54% win rate in bot lane he's also 51% in mid lane.  This means there's room to nerf him without making him useless.  Suggestion is simply undoing the Q buffs he got earlier this season.

Heimerdinger Mages are an issue in bot lane and have been for multiple season now.  My suggestion is making his turrets less durable to offer a better chance of killing them quickly.

Karthus another mage taking over bot lane suggestion is further lowering his armor so he can actually lose all ins without getting a kill trade even through his passive.  Alternatively lowering his Q damage again same goal making it so he can be successfully all ined.

Quinn completely broken ever since the TP changes this season my suggestion is increasing the CD of Vault significantly to offer more counterplay for melee champs.  16/15/14/13/12 would be my suggestion.

Riven champ has been OP this entire season and is in need of some big nerfs my suggestion is nerfing her E CD.

Aurelion Sol and Pyke Mid

I don't see Asol enough and I also don't play him so I can't comment fairly on what nerfs he needs but I can say he definitely does need nerfed.

The play rate of Pyke mid has tripled since the start of this season.  Pyke is such a cool concept when played in his intended role as a support, sadly it's too easy for him to roam and he can basically force this play style on the game by ignoring the lane and perma roaming bot.  To understand why Pyke mid is so bad for solo queue you need to understand how you beat it.  You basically beat it by having your bot lane never go aggressive and respect that he will perma roam bot lane.  This makes for a very boring game for the enemy ADC and support who are likely to get fed up with this boring playstyle and then die to Pyke and lose the game.

My suggestion is finding a way to lock him out of solo lanes.  My suggestion is making it so his Ultimate won't work without a support item.  I'm sure riot could come up with some other creative solutions but at the end of the day he needs to be kept out of solo lanes.",4

I heard that today's meta is ""everyone oneshots eyeryone"" and I looked at [u.gg](https://u.gg) for Gwen's winrate and it's one of the worst in the game.   


so what certianly happened, why is she so bad right now, did she get nerfs or the new meta or changed items don't favor her so much? Also many immobile tanks right now like Tahm, Garen, Ornn and Yorick has one of the highest winrates rn so still I am confused why she is so bad and if I still can pick her against tanky top?  


P. S. I am not Gwen main by any means but I always wanted to learn her and become one, I get special joy playing on hit ap champions especially in top. I usually play tanks which helps me a lot with her because I excatly know how to counter micro wise and macro wise most of them and I know what limits they have.  
I play at mid platinum level and easily would be better but my macro often sucks ass and isn't calmy thought out as much as I wished which often leads me in mid game to disadvantage and ""what the fuck should I do rn now mode"" but it can be helped and worked on with no big deal.

\- duo with other silver friend: +13lp on win, - 16lp on loss (he got +23lp on win, and -8 on loss)

I feel like GG has a hard time closing out the mid to late game so C9 will have more chances to take control but we have seen time and time again that C9 struggles to play from behind. Summit wins games with a gold lead but when he falls behind is often caught pushing with the same pace and tempo in side lanes as he does when he is feed. Just based on the fact that GG has had some strong early games during the season and a lot of games they couldn't close out due to macro, Is there a chance they have solved some of those issues and can take the series over C9 and go to Houston?

2193,leagueoflegends,"This is a rough and abridged translation of a post in the League of Legends Gallery of DCINSIDE. Today, reporter Yeonjae Shin of Inven in a youtube stream revealed her estimations of the LCK team payrolls based on her talks with insiders. (These estimates are only of the players in the main rosters, and do not include transaction fees. I don't know whether the options are included or not. The payroll for LCK teams rose exponentially in the past few years, a growth comparable to that of crypto prices.)

&amp;#x200B;

10th: Fredit Brion - less than 820k

9th: HLE - about 1.25mil

They did compete for free agents in the offseason but lost out a lot

8th: Liiv Sandbox - about 1.5mil (maybe more than 1.65)

6,7th: Kwangdong or Nongshim

The reporter is not so sure about their rankings, but both teams' salaries are around 3.3mil, give or take.

5th: KT - more than 4.1mil

The team didn't spend much in 2021, but they really invested this year, and in summer they will definitely do better with Vicla as a starter.

4th: DRX - about 4.9mil

The botlane duos are really expensive, and Zeka's salary is definitely lower than 1.6mil.

3rd: DK - definitely more than 5mil and definitely more than DRX

2nd: Gen.g - at least 5.8mil

Understandable considering the name value of the players. She also notes that the star players' salaries are not as high as one might think but the middle players' salaries are quite higher than expected.

1st: T1 - about 8.2mil (But she says that info of T1 is quite limited)

She also notes that the team's salary minus Faker would not be the 1st, and also that for 2020, T1's operating costs were around 10mil in their released financial statements.

(BTW obviously they are all dollars)

&amp;#x200B;

Further comments

\*When she started working in 2015, star players got paid less than 800k. Now they get paid at least 1.6mil.

\*As for Nuguri, it's solely up to him to decide whether to return or not.

\*Her most surprising transaction during her career was Rekkles joining G2.

&amp;#x200B;

\*After the stream, the vice president of DK posted a tweet implying that DK's team payroll was way more than what the reporter suggested and that he would be really happy if he could run a team with the estimated amount of money (5mil).

Simple question, as seen in the title.

Is there an English EU Masters broadcast? On Lolesports, I can only get the Italian, Spanish, Polish and French broadcasts. More do seem to exist (e.g. Dutch), but I can't find any complete list, nor does the EU Masters Twitch channel stream, and an EU Masters YouTube channel doesn't even seem to exist based on a quick search - certainly ""EU Masters"" doesn't return any English livestreams.

I get that EU Masters is all about the European regions, and therefore more localized broadcasts, but there is also England, *where people speak English*, and apparently they do not have their own broadcast? Not to mention that you lack an American audience this way.

The EU Masters Twitter account is active, by the way, but they haven't posted any links to an English broadcast.",4

hey guys,

whenever I launch league, it gives me the trying to reconnect screen. I've redownloaded league and tried everything.

My WIFI is perfectly fine but at random times (every time I launch league now), it will say ""trying to reconnect"" and give me that popup. I've tried loads of different ways but I haven't been able to fix it..  Been happening for months now and it's so hard to even get into a game with my friends. It'll take like so many restarts of the game for it to randomly work.

I always played league on the same laptop. Btw I'm on mac.

2201,leagueoflegends,"I like a champion with a good wave clear and farm well. I also like AD champs because they can farm fast, deal lots of damage over time, and get turrets down quick. But, I also like to keep at a distance and wait for the enemy to roam so I can start chipping away at their turret. I mostly let my minion wave do the work for me while I recall and buy some items. Long distance range and good kitting is what I’m usually looking for, melee fights are not what I’m looking for. 

just to give you an idea of who I like to play: I play Teemo, Seraphine, and recently Kayle. 
Teemo because I don’t always have to fight to deal damage, Seraphine because she can do well in team fights and has good wave control and burst late game, and Kayle because her AD is really good and deals lots of damage. 

If anyone has a champion that fits that type of play style, please tell me. Thanks!",4
2202,leagueoflegends,"First off, when Akali ults you, there are 2 main combos she will do, either she will r1+E+ignite to guarantee the E damage, and if you didnt flash her initial r1+e you have flash to flash her r2, only that the problem is that her r2 is instant, so it becomes more of a luckbased mindgame rather than outplaying her, akin to Malphite ulting you near melee range.

Scenario 2 is that Akali r1 ignites you, you try to dodge the E because you think she needs it to have enough damage to kill you, she never uses it, she uses r2 and you are at 10-15% health and you flash away, and she just flashes after and q's for the kill and then uses E to escape.

Most other assassins has some key ability that has a cast time that you at the very least flash away from it(zed q, fizz q+r on minion, katarina dagger, nocturne fear, ekko q/w/e/r etc etc), or exhaust them(doesnt work on akali because she just waits out the exhaust in the shroud while you are unable to attack her)

In the toplane, its pretty much the same except toplane champions usually have to be poked down to 80% hp, but since most are melee akali has no problem to do so.

All in all the akali pretty much has to play bad in order for you to live, and in high elo that basically never happens because everyone knows what Akali does.",4

2208,leagueoflegends,"NOTE: This is a repost (from 28th March) in order to reach more people - for obvious reasons, given the nature of the post topic. If you have already read the original post, sorry for bothering you.

Fellow League players, fans, supporters and connoisseurs,

my name is Vojta, I am known as ""Crtk"" in gaming world, and I am a student of marketing and trade at Technical University of Ostrava (Czech Republic).

As part of my university diploma thesis, I decided to carry out a research aimed to analyze consumer behaviour of League players. The key element of the research is a questionnaire survey; hence, I turn to this subreddit with my plea for help.

I would like to kindly ask each and every one of you for five minutes of your time. If you could spare that much (will not take more) and fill in the questionnaire in the link, I would be ever so grateful.

The questionnaire is, as I mentioned above, about consumer behaviour; basically, I am trying to find out whether players buy in-game stuff, how much they are willing to spend on it, what motivates them to buy etc. You can find more information in the screen right after you click on the link. While the questionnaire asks for some information about yourselves, it does not need to know your name or any sensitive personal information - it is completelly anonymous.

I hope that some of you can find those few minutes to help fellow gamer; I also believe that maybe, one day, I will be able to repay the favour.

Thank you and I wish you all the best in your lives.

After his play on Vlad, a stealthed Evelynn tries to get a counter kill, but he outplays Evelynn super hard too.

2222,leagueoflegends,"For a long time Gemstones were only available from chests at a 2.68% chance to drop. This means as a F2P player you would need to open roughly 400 chests (over 8 years worth on average) to get enough gemstones to acquire a coveted Hextech Skin. Hextech Skins have always been some of the most exclusive and rarest skins in the game. (Sure there are rarer skins but those are really really rare) Seeing a hextech skin in a game used to make you go ""oh damn"" like this person really put in years of their time and devoted their 10 gems to get a skin. It took me about 3 years to get my first one. 

Now the conversion has happened and the issue that I have with it the most is not the conversion rate, 10 for 1 seems fine at face value, but then the shop for mythic skins is completely upside down. Now you have low effort skins costing double the cost of the old hextech skins. 

When I say low effort I dont mean in quality or looks... Example: any prestige skin took less than a month to acquire in game. You used to be able to trade 2200 of any event currency to get 100 prestige points. Which would have unlocked a prestige skin. So why are some prestige skins being priced at what equates to 16.6 years worth of gemstone farming for F2P players? 


If they really want to try and say that these skins are better than the hextech/gemstone skins and push them as the more exclusive flavor that's fine.. It's Whatever.. But then the exchange rate for current gemstones feels bad based on the amount of time devoted to earning them before hand. 

Prestige point skins in the past were much easier to get than gemstone skins. League has about 5 major events per year. Most of those have 1 gemstone as a mission if you buy the bundle and complete it. But it was fairly easy to get 100 prestige points by trading in your 2200 tokens given the time frame in which you had to do so. 

That means in a given calendar year the game would give you 5 prestige skins assuming you played enough to earn 2200 tokens. They also give you 1 gemstone per event so about half an opportunity to get a gemstone skin in the same time frame. If we factor in rng drops from chests... That's 104 potential chests in 2 years at a drop rate of 2.68% so call it 3. That is a total of 10 prestige skins = 13 gemstones. Or.. A prestige skin was worth about 1.3 gemstones. 

But now... Prestige skins = 125 magic essence which was 12.5 gemstones. Yes the magic essence can be obtained much easier now. So the conversion rate for gemstones should have been much higher than 1 for 10 and gemstone skins should cost more. Otherwise all the money people spent to obtain gemstones has been massively devalued. Like the bundles that were 5000 plus riot points that you know people purchased just because it was a guaranteed gemstone drop. Those are pointless expenses now. They devalued gemstone skins massively. 

Using this value for time/effort calculation.. 13 gemstones = 10 prestige skins. Prestige skins cost about 125 each now so (10 x 125) ÷ 13 = a gemstone should have been worth 96 mythic essence and a former gemstone skin should cost 960me.

By not doing it this way everyone that spent loads of money buying bundles for varying costs of riot points to bypass waiting forever for RNG wasted their money. The goal was to get a rare skin that very few people had and now they are the cheapest skins in the game. You can get 5 of them for every 4 events instead of 1 every 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Due to making prestige skins cost more than gemstone skins used to... And by not giving a fair conversion value of gemstones per Mythic essence... Gemstone/Hextech skins went from the hardest to obtain to the easiest to obtain overnight completely devaluing them by making all the effort and money that went into getting them a massive waste.",4

Loot was Just introduced when i jumped off, and I know It was subjected to several changes in time, but I could not undestrand how game breaking was for someone Who loves in game content.
I could not spend real currency to get the skins I love beccause my economic condition shifted throughout these years, so I decided to test how many skins I could obtain with a little experiment; without spending a single penny, I kept track of all the possible methods to obtain free in game content, including loot, a prime gaming account borrowed from a friend Who doesn't play League and events (like Arcane Capsules and Event Missions). I'm still looking for other ways, right now trying to leverage Buff and Microsoft Rewards mechanism, but the final result with some re-roll optimization and luck Is the following:

• Dark Star Kha Zix (1350 RP)
• Dark Cosmic Lux (1820 RP)
• Sentinel Olaf (1350 RP)
• Astronautilus (1350 RP)
• Sentinel Irelia (1350 RP)

• Project: Jhin (1350 RP)
• Championship Ryze (1350 RP)
• Omega Squad Tristana (1350 RP)
• Unused Prime RP (2150 RP)

The total amount of obtained value sits around 31.000 RP, which is roughly 250$; this value does not also take in account other side elements such as Chroma bought with Essence Emporium, unclaimed Skins/Skin Shards in the loot, Wards and Emotes. 
Overall my general idea is that the system Is overall underappreciated, and despite any criticism that can be directed toward Riot, it's undeniable that the free content they provide for a free game is overwhelming compared to other games; sometimes is worth to Just sit and appreciate what this game and its team provides without asking anything back, in a word where corporate mindset pollutes most of the stuff we enjoy.",4

2240,leagueoflegends,"This content is from korean league of legends youtube channel ""PS"" 

This post is based on plat+elo Korean server, about the champions on the rise after patch 12.6  

 Since the data is collected for three days after the patch, the number of samples may be slightly be insufficient and the values may vary.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Talon**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/91/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/91/statistics/)

Talon Jungle seemed to disappear into the history as the additional damage to monsters disappeared with the last 12.2 patch.  


[Talons patch history, Talon's w Additional damage nurfed to 105&amp;#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/psub64fgzfr81.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca5f7abf1e0c28bb8e96b4238328ab9d9d8e8834)

However, Talon jungle is emerging again. And the 12.6 patch has boosted talon's rise.  
Currently, the winning rate is 52.3% and the pick rate is 3.4%, up 1.2%p from the last patch.  
The biggest reason is that there is a huge nerf on hecarim and  over time, Talon jungle players' adapted to talon's early jungle camps may have affected to the rise.  
Talon's E-skill has a high value of mobility. However, the Talon jungle shows a trend that the merit decreases as the tier goes up.  
In the master or higher elo, win rate was 46.6% and the pick rate was 5.9%, which is clearly higher than before, but its not   
recommendable.  
In high elo, players often take advantage of opponent's slow camp clearing by invading and early engagements.  


[JG talon's expected winrate graph](https://preview.redd.it/y3pfwcre4gr81.png?width=229&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e65e82dc45e329c034fc1fa30248c596c88621)

In fact, the predicted winning percentage graph of Jungle Talon shows an upward right graph with a fairly large slope. Therefore, it would be desirable to pick talon after the opponent jungler is picked and I recommend that you match with the mid-champion that will compensate for your initial weakness.  
As long as talon makes up for his disadvantage in early jungle phase, he must still be an active jungler.

&amp;#x200B;

 **9. Camille**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/164/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/164/statistics/)

https://preview.redd.it/5oa7j3wwugr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32d5f365859688b3951aed384b8d13fb1572c93a

In this patch, there were many changes to the champion centered on the upper lanes, and among them, TOP's ecosystem is in the midst of reorganizing.  
In the meantime, Camille shows a rise in relative value. The winning rate has risen 1.4%p compared to the last patch, making a pleasant start.  
The biggest reason is the nerf of tryndamere. Originally, if the donminating champion of any line is nerfed hard, the champions right under that will benefit from it.  
Among them, Camille, in particular, when there is no exceptionally strong champion at the top, the difficulty of the line game is eased, and the index rises as the frequency of exerting influence in the late game increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Camille prediction multiplier graph 12.5b\(L\) 12.6\(R\)](https://preview.redd.it/e98tvnxm6gr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af7e84821b426235d0e09d8b1024ecc99c3975d6)

In fact, Camille's win rate graph shows that the low point of the 10-15 minute interval has risen compared to the last patch, and the high point comes a little faster after 25 minutes.  
However, it seems difficult to reach the first tier because other champions are on the rise in the current top ecosystem. 

**8. Gangplank**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/41/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/41/statistics/)

Gangplank has been showing promising results quietly. However, thanks to the reorganization of the tower ecosystem, he is showing better results.  
Gangplank succeeded to be tier 1 champ with a win rate of 51.1% and a pick rate of 6.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tough Matchup of Gangplank\(12.5b\)](https://preview.redd.it/pfp3tykf7gr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92cc44f8a4d4d86cbf0a03fd46187871fe7e3f01)

 It can be taken for granted that Tryndamere, most difficult to deal with previous patches, is on the decline. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Gangplank 2nd-Core build Data ](https://preview.redd.it/p69cwhqz7gr81.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc90931783120b1a9a610f8f876019bca5b6aca4)

 What's interesting is that the gangplank, hullbreaker as 2nd core and focusing on the side lane is showing positive data. Currently, the pickrate is over 20% and win rate is 56.59, Which shows far more advantageous data over other 2nd core items.

 

[ Gangplank win rate prediction graph \(12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/wzn8r9fr8gr81.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8f27ccb915dd5d129ec259eeca5db77fe0776eb)

Contrary to popular perception, the current solo rank-based gangplank is a snowball champion who has to continue it's benefits of the line match.

It is true that gangplank is strong after level 13, but the difficulty is too high, and blasting his barrels in team fights are hard.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Gangplank Spell Data ](https://preview.redd.it/ayb17p05agr81.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508c6d3d3e73c27918b76577720da05802d64f65)

As a result, the win rate of the gangplank focused on the line is significantly higher by using the ignite. This kind of play has enough merit, and based on skilled players, gangplank can exert both line and second half influence.  
Obviously its a difficult champion, but it's worth practicing. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **7. Zeri**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/221/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/221/statistics/)

What is the limit of this champion? The last patch was a huge nerf for Zeri and she showed a huge decline.  
However, the current data after 12.6 patch shows Zeri is one of usable main adc.   
Currently, the win rate is 50.3%, pick rate of 11.2%, and ban rate of 23.1%, recording the highest data among second tier adcs.

&amp;#x200B;

[Easy matchup of Zeri \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/ip46ms4gbgr81.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738aef0819498b88aeeea4419949964f901439e9)

 t is believed that Zeri's rise is driven by his superiority over Samira, Kaisa and Jaya, who have frequently appeared recently.  
Basically, Zeri has a long range thanks to her Q skills. Therefore, she has an advantageous structure against a champion who has shorter range than her and has no means of checking the line match.  
Kaisa, Samira, and even zhaya are all uncomfortable against champions with long ranges.  
The combined pick rate of the three adc is close to 45 percent, so the current Zeri index seems to be possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[hard matchup of Zeri \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/2wih0vjbdgr81.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e8dbe230a3f5613a53bcf65c889967279d81c9)

It is difficult to withstand the early lane match against MF, Draven, TRistana, Jhin, and Lucian, stronger adcs in lane compared to Zeri.  
Therefore, Picking Zeri after opponent ADC  is a way to make full use of her.  
It clearly shows that the carrying power in the late game, such as the overwhelming range of Q skills and the movement speed of the ultimate is great as long as lane phase is smooth.  
It's amazing to see her performing well again after so many nerfs. 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Azir**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/268/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/268/statistics/)

Azir received a very good buff patch. My growth health increased by 13, and final base health in level 18 increased by 211.  
For Azir, who has to be close to deal full damage did benefit alot with health buff.  
Currently, the win rate is 50.5% and the pick rate is 2.3%. It is quite encouraging that Azir, considering its famous for champion difficulties.  
In the master+ elo, the win rate was 53.6% and the pick rate was 2.2%, showing even better indicators.  
This data is for solo rank, but we should pay more attention to Azir when this patch version is applied to pro stages.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Darius**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/122/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/122/statistics/)

Darius now has a win rate of 52.4 percent and a pick rate of 8.4 percent. This is the one fo the highest indicators in top lane.  
The buff of the ultimate was not small, Darius, which was originally powerful, is more lethal.  
Not only that, Top lane dominator Tryndamere is nerfed pretty badly by this patch, aiding darius to trend.  
What's interesting is that unlike the perceptions that darius is strong in a low tier, he has a win rate of 53.6% in the diamond+ elo and a win rate of 54% in the master+ elo, recording a higher win rates as the tier rises.  
The win rate is 51% in the Bronze\~gold section, recording the one of the highest win rates in all sections.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Darius 1-core data ](https://preview.redd.it/jcerb40engr81.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5fa38369c464a0a39793e0dd1613631e47ace24)

As the darius' lane dominance has risen, the index of the Trinity Force records the highest, and it is also possible to use the stride breaker and hull breaker according to the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Darius 3-core combination data ](https://preview.redd.it/088fxr9rngr81.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f97f5f7a6e689d47c4cd8d1693d17959e189755)

It has shown that darius is best with typical bruiser items death's dance and sterak's or death's dance and Malmortius

In particular, Darius has the highest growth attack power in the rift with a growth attack of 5, so please note that the efficiency of the sterak as a third core item is quite good. 

&amp;#x200B;

[hard matchup of Darius \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/j4bcgszaogr81.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a6d81410ff8a06cf6b0437f3aec0870b21a668)

There is definitely a disadvantage against long-distance champions such as Vayne and Kayle, but it is undeniable that darius is one of the best top champions at this point, and their influence doubles if selected after your top opponent.

Darius,which every top laner must have tried at least once, is no longer a choice, but must play champion.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Rengar**

[**https://lol.ps/en/champ/107/statistics/**](https://lol.ps/en/champ/107/statistics/)

https://preview.redd.it/kbm2vhwjxgr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b05a2d6598ee0b2f97908e882cf7a161f0aa5fd1

Rengar has received a wide variety of convenience patches. When taking a leap, it not only eased wild stack standards, but also lowered the difficulty of in-play, such as maintaining the stack and providing a view around E and the ultimate device, as well as increased the overall diversity of play.

On top of that, without any adjustment to the Q skill, the empowered Q skill can now be critically hit + additional damage proportional to the critical hit probability, so the index had to rise.

Currently, it has a win rate of 51.4% and a pick rate of 5.1%, including himself in the 2nd tier. Rengar's play is so unique that it's a huge rise considering that he was a champion only skilled users played.

The pick rate has also increased considerably.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Rengar's 1st-Core item Data ](https://preview.redd.it/tdqvxfrmpgr81.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f17e6f5b874f5f3ce73e2d8e60fe452d7015f80a)

Although it is still difficult to give a clear answer due to the lack of samples, a build that uses Immortal Shieldbow as one core shows the possibility of research.  
Based on Immortal Shieldbow, it is a build that utilizes items based on fatal hits such as essence reaver - the collector.  
Research on Rengar is expected to continue in the future, and will share it again when the mainstream build is established. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **3. Jax**  
[https://lol.ps/en/champ/24/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/24/statistics/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1uoer11oxgr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4531948d287d1d34802b368c248082addc3bf80

Jax currently has a win rate of 50.6 percent and a pick rate of 7.7 percent. In addition to the rise in the basic damage of the w, it is showing the proper efficacy of the buff that received basic physical strength buff.

  
In particular, Jax's performance increases as the tier rises. In the master+ elo, the winning rate was 53.8% and the pick rate was 10.7%, showing monster-like data. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Jax's predicted win percentage graph 12.5b\(L\) 12.6\(R\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxktbyxjqgr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e9238f6f5b02632cee71580786c1665f0f14f5)

 In addition, there is no significant change in the shape of the predicted winning rate graph, but the winning rate in the pre-line stage has risen from the early 49% range to close to 50%, making the low point a little higher.  
Now, instead of showing ambiguity in the line match, he has transformed himself into an insurance-like champion with guaranteed carrying power in the late game. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Jax' 3-core item build data ](https://preview.redd.it/f4jqlilhrgr81.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc72db3687997a21dcc1e66a0f755415b98ece9)

Blade of ruined king, trinity force, and death's dance three core combination is the most selected and best performing build. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Lucian**  
[https://lol.ps/en/champ/236/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/236/statistics/)

Unexpected Lucian ranks second in the ranking of champions benefited by 12.6 patch. In fact, Lucian's rise did not start out of nowhere.  
It just happened right after the 12.5b patch, as users who did not immediately realize Lucian's power started to play him. 

Lucian's pick rate has risen from 18% to 22.9% now, and the average winning rate has been on the rise, recording 53.2%. Even the ban rate has risen sharply to the top among adcs, achieving the 22% ban rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8drtn0obtgr81.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27c6d568e89bd6a8cce719f921051694e7938484

Based on the current data, there is hard matchup except for Ash and Tristana.

lucian a typical Solo-Rank strong winning rate graph with a winning rate of 53 percent in 15 minutes.  
So much so that Lucian's destructive power now is beyond imagination. If you are a one-deal user, I recommend that you use Lucian more actively. 

**1. Nidalee**

[**https://lol.ps/en/champ/76/statistics/**](https://lol.ps/en/champ/76/statistics/)

Nidalee is ranked first in list of champions that benefited this patch. Let's take a look at the data first. Nidalee has a winning rate of 50.7% and a pick rate of 15.8%, showing one of the top indicators of the jungle. 

It is hard to believe that win rate has risen by 5% with 6.6% higher pick rate. 

This is because proficiency must be supported in order to make full use of Nidalee.  
Recent buff of Nidalee was not small, and Hecarim, who ruled in the jungle until the last patch, fell into the abyss in an instant.  
Naturally, the higher the tier, the better Nidali's index is, and it shows a monstrous data of 52.7% win rate, 22.6% pick rate, and 42% ban rate in the master+ elo.  
Recently, the AP jungle champion has been weak, but she changed it at once. If this happens, the mid- and top champion picks will also be affected.  
We need to carefully observe how Nidalee's rise will change other lines.",4

2244,leagueoflegends,"Every game recently I've seen hullbreaker.  Either a Sion, or a Trundle, or a Yorick or even Trynd- and its always the same thing, no matter how much you try to put them behind, they will eventually just end the game by splitting because your team can't do two things at once.   I've lost so many games recently just due to hullbreaker- even when the person using it is massively behind.  We had a yasuo doing it one game and he still managed to 1v3 people in a lane alone due to the tankiness, and once an inhib goes down, its just a spiral into defeat unless we just force an end, which nearly never happens in norms.   It feels like a plague, and I'm not sure what to do about it when I see it.   


Just last game I was suuuper fed on ezreal, but it didn't matter- because the whole team had to be on the guy with hullbreaker, or I had to, and then it was either me trying to 1v4 or the team being unable to fight theirs while I dealt with the yorick using hullbreaker.   And I see it a lot when I'm not the one ahead, too- you just need a level of coordination to deal with it that random groups of people aren't going to have.   


Anyone know a good way or some champion that is great at dealing with this without resorting to it their self?  And I can't go to ranked, because I play with 1-2 friends, and duo is going away soon so even duo ranked isn't really an option to avoid norms. :/

Not too long ago we got lillia, rell, and gwen and they all have seemingly fallen out of relevancy not too long after they came, with no real work seeming to be made to bring them back into popularity. Same can be said for a lot of older champions too, like skarner(rework in like 2+ years, lol), kog, ivern, olaf, and taric to list a few that sit at sub 1% pick rates on average. 

Shouldn't there be a more active effort to just work on these champions (and items) and get them back up to speed for new and old players alike to have more of a reason to play them? After releasing so many, new additions nowadays just feel like another drop in the bucket rather than something special, and seem to be putting LoL into a race to burn itself out of ideas. 

In my honest opinion, ASU's and VGU's are the way to go from now on, and should receive the central focus rather than pumping out champs seemingly after every other month that is time after time causing issues for the game and causing frustration.",4
2246,leagueoflegends,"Heya peeps! Just wondering what are the safest top lane picks when first picking or just blind picking.

I am a mid main, but I've found that my only real decent macro skill is wave control. Other than that my mechanics are what carry me, so I'm making the move to top.

Could you please help me out with safe blind picks before I start my climb? 

Been playing Darius, Ornn and Irelia, but I feel that each of those have pretty solid counters and can get screwed over if picked against.",4

2249,leagueoflegends,"Hi guys, i am currently the captain of a competitive team, we're trying to improve our macro and map play, but I've never been a huge fan of eSports so i lack knowledge about all the possible team formations and how to execute them, except for the 1 - 3 - 1.

2250,leagueoflegends,"I wanted to know if anyone else feels like those 2 items arent really ""good"" for the game.  
Hul rewards you for basically playing PvE in a PVP game and Collector is just so weird to me ... an item that just says ye u dont really have to kill someone ill kill him for u if you sneeze on him below 5% hp",4
2251,leagueoflegends,"For the longest time, top has been an island and jungler a have no reason to come top for the following 3 reasons:

(1) herald isn’t as valuable as dragon

(2) dragon is bot

(3) bot has 2 champions, so you effectively get 2 champs ahead by camping bot instead of just 1 champ by camping top (not to mention there is more champion kill gold to be made bot).


So, what if drag and baron swapped locations? Namely, drag is top and baron is bot.

This could potentially give junglers a legitimate reason to actually come top lane since there is a valuable objective. But, bot wouldn’t become an island as the incentive of possibly getting 2 champions ahead still exists. Therefore, the play around either lane would become more balanced, and thus the game would become far more interesting. What do you guys think?",4
2252,leagueoflegends,"Here are two Riot employees [discussing this on twitter](https://twitter.com/_Sarand/status/1510821924519129089).

This is an absurdly unsafe thing to do, even just at the widely understood risk level for Covid. If any employees or their family or friends are immunocompromised, this is putting their lives in immediate grave danger.

But at this moment in particular, we are rapidly discovering that even mild cases of Covid have long-lasting, very serious effects in a far higher percentage of people than previously thought. This is the time to be giving the disease newfound respect, and staying the hell home. It's absolutely appalling that Riot is signing its employees up for [brain damage](https://www.today.com/health/even-mild-covid-19-linked-brain-damage-scans-show-rcna19001?cid=sm_npd_td_fb_ma) and [dramatically increased risk of blood clots and organ failure](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/opinions/covid-19-cardiovascular-symptoms-sepkowitz/index.html).

Riot, this isn't even a matter of deciding between the game and people's lives. You can make the game just fine with remote work — I know, because I am on a full-remote software development team, and we're more productive than we were before the pandemic. My workdays are literally longer and more relaxed because I don't commute. There's just absolutely no excuse for this. Please stop.",4
2253,leagueoflegends,"This game mode is especially vulnerable to afks.

Firstly it’s just a bad game mode because it’s a 50-50 chance of you being helpless against the other champ.

People get frustrated very easily and give up so quickly without considering what scaling is like. They don’t want to put in an effort to win. They just want to go next every after 5 minutes.

I played 3 games of this, each one had this problem.

Singed vs Morgana (closest game): a Singed went AFK

Yasuo vs Senna (1 Yasuo went AFK and 1 was intentionally feeding whining because we did not play his Jhin)

Garen vs Ahri: 1 Garen went afk for the last 7 minutes of the game. It was starting to turn into Garen’s favor too.",4

2257,leagueoflegends,"So I have a few ideas for champs I've been mulling over, but I'm just going to talk about one of them.

p- gains more armor and mr the closer he is to terrain

q- he charges up a skill shot, releasable at any time; at full charge if the projectile hits terrain it creates an aoe blast, if terrain is champ made it destroys the terrain and the blast is bigger and knocks back enemies a short distance

w- passive: abilities cast in his vision range that are obscured (ie behind walls or bushes) show a visual cue to him (doesn't show on the map or anything)

active: he releases a short range pulse that  damages nearby enemies and reveals them for a few seconds

e- he does a dashes a fixed distance. upon collision with terrain he latches on and can recast his e again, this time dragging temporary terrain with him on his dash

r- he tosses stones to a target location, knocking down  and damaging enemies and becoming temporary terrain where they land (not a single piece but like 3- 6 stones of temporary terrain) (not like Xerath ult, but more a set formation like Taliyah's mines)

&amp;#x200B;

Lore wise and thematically I thought he'd be cool to tie in with Taliyah, though I don't pay much attention to lore nor would I be good at writing it, so no info there.

**Passive: Guerilla Warfare**

If Teemo stands still for 1 second, he becomes stealthed. If walking into the brush, he will stealth immediately even if he is moving or taking damage.

If Teemo exits stealth (either by leaving brush or by moving) he performs a dodge roll and gains a large attack speed buff, and move speed while running away from enemy champions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Blinding Dart**

Teemo fires a direct in a line, hitting the first champion it meets dealing magic damage and blinding them.

If Teemo is stealthed, the damage inflicted is increased and the blind lasts longer.

&amp;#x200B;

**W: Sprint**

*Passive: Teemo gains % bonus movement speed. This bonus is doubled while running away from enemy champions.*

Active: Teemo performs a dodge roll, gaining movement speed and attack speed.

If Teemo enters stealth, the cool down on this ability is refreshed.

&amp;#x200B;

**E: Toxic Shot**

*Passive: Teemo's basic attacks deal additional magic damage on hit and over time.*

Active: (Can only be cast while stealthed) Teemo blows a silent yet toxic dart to target enemy, dealing damage and poisoning them. This ability does not reveal Teemo.

&amp;#x200B;

**R: Noxious Trap**

*Passive: Each time Teemo dodge rolls, he leaves behind a mushroom that arms faster than usual. Additionally if Teemo dies, he also explodes like a mushroom.*

Active: Basically the same as live, except placing a mushroom does not reveal him.",4

2272,leagueoflegends,"I'm considering buying tickets as I live in texas, but they are pretty dang expensive compared to past lcs events. Just wondering if its literally just go sit down and watch them game or if there are other things like vendors, or meet and greets or other things?

2274,leagueoflegends,Recap of what actually happened on April 1st in blind pick.,4
2275,leagueoflegends,"Was talking to my buddies and we are all having issues most games because we all want to play a role someone else wants to and only knows how to play. I said we needed a new lane/area on the rift and it pretty much goes like this, and before yall read, just know I made it up on the spot and am expecting some bad comments about my far fetched idea and I am all for suggestions and even criticism. 

&amp;#x200B;

This new area would be the void, quite literally. 

You are instantly banished there at beginning of the game if it's the role you got. Thing is, no one knows who will be subjected to the void. The goal is to survive there and rack up as much gold as possible. Monsters will be such like the jungle creeps, except there is a few new creeps that actually roam and look for you. The void is essentially dark, obviously, so your vision would be like nocturnes ult, just permanent until you are out and back on the rift. The creeps that roam would have more vision than you and they know their way around the voided area. They aren't as powerful and health as dragon or rift, but much more stronger than regular creep camps but killing them, if you can is much more rewarding with gold and health and buffs. There are only 2 ways back to the rift. Either kill ALL of the new special void creeps and get so many stacks or points which would be a new idea implemented, or, your team has to get aced 3 times to the point the game is like ""Alright, you're up buddy""

&amp;#x200B;

That was my idea. I just randomly made it up on the spot but it would be pretty cool to see something like this in league just to make things harder and worse.

2276,leagueoflegends,I was just wondering how to get the 2200 tokens necessary for the mythic essence.  I have 1200 token but no more challenge left (other than the infinity one). IS there going to more challenges or I just need to play like 500 games?,4
2277,leagueoflegends,How did you hit? Yes,4
2278,leagueoflegends,"the whole system is just kind of bad. theres 5 roles but you can only pick two. its either two or all of them. you cant just pick three or four so your pigeon holed into playing less than half the roles, but youll almost certainly get autofilled into the one role you dont want or cant play. 

youre limited to you can play with because god forbid one of your friends plays the same two roles you do. why cant you queue with someone who also plays top mid for example? one person gets top, the other person either defaults to mid or gets autofilled or whatever needs to happen. 

we had FOUR people in our lobby and we couldnt queue because two of us play mid and top. FOUR PEOPLE. and it kept us from queueing. 

i like being able to choose my role. i remember what it was like back in the day being last hit and praying you werent getting the roles you hate. but just because its better doesent mean its perfect and its far from perfect.

 i think being able to at least have the option to pick a third, it doesent have to be mandatory, it would be so much better. if you like more than two roles youre not stuck trying to juggle between the three of them. i imagine it would also alleviate autofill woes because thats an entire other role you can fill into before it starts autofilling you. 

maybe thats not the solution, but i just dont think the way it is, is where it should stay. i feel like it could just be better, and why not make it better?",4

2281,leagueoflegends,"I've returned to league after a 2 or 3 year break and the new attack move left click option has my old keybindings all mucked up.

I use a Razer Naga mouse, the one with 12 buttons of the left side of the mouse and years back, I could use the number 1 as my left mouse click just fine.

The problem is that now with the in-client option to use attack move left click, you cannot just left click things like the minimap. You now have to hold shift and then click to select things.

Is there a way to undo this?

I've tried to rebind some of these things in client, but it won't flat out let me bind my left mouse click to things.

Your top laner cant hold him back. You need to send 1 or two people up to even stop him. Meanwhile you lose the rest of the map due to that pressure.

You dont have to be a good player to abuse this strategy top. There is little skill or decision making involved. These players typically just die all the time but still accomplish everything that needs to be done a) farm b) push tower 3) draw 2-3 players.

Since it's my first time getting the pass I was wondering what experiences other members have had with this. How many tokens have you accrued in previous events? 

And if &gt;4000 tokens is possible, can you get the ME multiple times? I hate the ""battle anime"" skins, and if I could get the ME for some previous prestige skins, that would be ideal.

2298,leagueoflegends,"The change of Renga Q´ s interaction with crit shows us again that we finally need to change Critical chance away from the random chance and towards a normal amplifier.   


Introducing Auto attack amplifier or AAA in short  
The new AAA will change crit so that youre if you have 20% AAA youre auto attack deal 20% more damage this goes up to 100% bonus dmg to a total of 200% dmg. While this is more than the normal 175% we have right now it also comes with a change to infinity edge to make it not necessary to build when you go crit.  


Overall this change would make crit more consistent without breaking it as on avg it would deal the exact same dmg but on lower Crit values you dont need to gamble as much as having luck and Crit with the first 2 aa in a battle or 2 waves of MF ult or hitting the barrel can complete change how a fight goes and it is amplified more with the extremely high dmg we have in the game right now.  


With this there is no random dmg spike for Crit users in a fight and since everyone knows exactly how much dmg they deal it comes down to Skill complettly. 

This also opens Crit users to build other items chance to not crit in the most important time while allowing non crit user to get a crit item without needing to focus on more.

Thank you for reading down below this point i will list all items and abilites that work with crit and how you can easily change it 

# Items

Rageblade  
Instead of  Convert crit to onhit dmg it now states AAA now increases Onhit effects instead of AA  


Infinity Edge  
The only idea i have is make it passive less and have 70AD and 40%AAA  


Naovies  
Changes to Attacks now reduce basic ability cooldown by 0-20% based on AAA

# Champions

Most Abilities that can crit now just scale with AAA some special cases are listed below

Yas and Yone Passive  
Still works the same with multiplying AAA by 2.5 but AAA only boost Attacks by 6% per 10% AAA.  
Yas ult  
Bonus armor pen now scales with AAA (5% per 10% AAA)  
Jhin  
4Th shot always 100% AAA. and Attacks grant Jhin  10% (+ 0.4% per 1% **bonus** as) \* 0,01 AAA **bonus** movement speed for 2 seconds.   
Ashe  
Still works the same but frost slow Strenght now scales with AAA.  
Aphelios  
Infernum now gains a flame for every 40% AAA  
Graves  
Attacks now gain a bullet for every 40% AAA  
Tryndamer  
E AA now reduce the cooldown by 0,07Sec per 10% AAA doubled against champions.",4

Hey, my name is Splaxx and over the last few years I've been trying to build a gaming/esports community.

As you might have read from the title, this is my last attempt. I put too much money, time and love into such projects. I simply can't afford to fail again.

I've been working for weeks on logos, intros, potential sponsors and the Discord server itself and now I'm ready to present it.

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to Team Clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

Team Clarity is supposed to be a gaming/eSports community.

A relaxed round with people you meet on the server up to professional esport league games. I want to have everything. Full program. Everyone can join of course. Be it origin, gender or age. It doesn't matter. Gaming is for everyone.

I am still looking for an entire team. From supporters to admins every position is still available.

So if you are interested in starting something big, just join the Discord server.

2323,leagueoflegends,"In light of the recent additions to bounties and ""catch up"" mechanics, I would be curious to hear the communities opinion on this.

League obviously isn't like MMOs but often times in games like WoW if you are a level 11 and you kill say a level 14, you will get more XP than if you kill a level 11. Do you think this concept should apply to mobas like league. Its in there for XP gains, but what about gold gains, earning more than 300G if the level diff is large for example

As an ADC main, when an enemy top laners snowballs off of solo kills, it can get extreme enough where he/she is 4 sometimes 5 levels ahead of me, making it almost impossible for me to kill that person, so I think it would be rewarding if there were level based bounties.

2334,leagueoflegends,"I've been wondering for a long time about this item. Does it make sense for it to be the second highest ap damage in the game right below Rabadon's?

I mean the item is designed for AP autoattackers, you deal extra damage per auto, so as long as you're constantly autoattacking, the item has no downtime, it applies its effect consistently and based on it's design one would assume it's a dps item and not a burst one.

There are champs like Diana and Shyvana who benefit from the attack speed this item grants but at the end of the day, both of those end up just bursting people down, especially Shyvanna since she builds the item and most of the time doesnt even auto champions with it.

So what do you think? Is it fair for a mainly dps item to give 25 more ap than Lich Bane for example which is actually a burst item?",4

Yes his stats are usually way better than the rest of his team but with they amount of games he plays I don't see the point in complaining.  It does not matter how good you (think) you are. If you don't have the dedication atleast for a week or two ...you ain't climbing. Unless you are a GM smurf in bronze. But that's besides the point.   
I know the guy for a while now and I know he can carry 1v9-ers easily. But nevertheless nobody can pull that off consistently in such few games or at all. This is why we expereince highs and lows in climbing.   
To sum things up. I just want to say to those people who blame their teams for not being able to climb. Get on yo butt and play more. Things will come and you will get to your deserved place eventually.

Seeing someone go from the brink of death to having them heal 800+ throughout a fight in a short period of time is really hard to deal with.

It's made worse on certain champions, namely ones like Riven Aatrox and Viego, and that's coming from someone who's two main champs are Riven and Aatrox. It's unfair, and the item makes the champs who can use it well way too tanky and also heal way too much.",4

2341,leagueoflegends,"I've been thinking about this for awhile, and I guess I finally seen this item enough to put all my thoughts and breakdowns of this thing online for everyone to flame me over. Prepare yourself, this is a really long analysis:

TL;DR: Hullbreaker as it exists is way too efficient without enough drawbacks, and leaves extremely little room for interactivity. Especially when compared to previously removed items that had half the strength but were still too 'meta-warping' to remain in League.

&amp;#x200B;

***Hullbreaker is bad for League of Legends and the arguments that it isn't are weak.***

Hullbreaker has been out for nearly a year now. In that time, it received two buffs increasing its base stats, and recently a nerf that affects ranged champions abilities to utilize it's passive resistances.

This item costs 2,800 gold, but gives roughly 3360 gold worth of base stats. This on its own is definitely an outlier compared to pretty much everything else, but that's *before* you count the stats that the passive gives. When adding the passive resistances (armor being worth 1200g and MR 1080, the amount of stats this item gives you comes out to 5,640g worth.

5,640g in stats for a legendary item that costs 2,800g. That's *200% gold efficient*.

This 200% gold efficiency is calculated BEFORE you start to add in the things that are difficult to quantify with a gold value:

* Gives the wielder +20% damage to towers (important to note that this affects demolish). When fighting turrets, this bonus in damage could easily be worth a few thousand gold by giving the same damage that bonus AD would give.
* Nearby siege minions gain up to 180 armor and 90 MR, as well as deal 200% damage to turrets. Difficult to quantify how valuable this since it isn't going on a champ, but gives the siege minion that equivalent of 12 cloth armors (3,600g) and roughly 3 null magic mantles worth of MR (1,350g)

Without adding in the value of push power your minions receive, all of the bonuses this item offers can come out to the 7000g-8000g range when hitting a tower, and between 11,000g-12,000g if you count the bonus resistances added to units around you, WITHOUT calculating in the value of their 200% bonus damage or finding some way to calculate the inherent value of siege minions tanking the tower for significantly longer during a push.

All of this combined into a single, 2,800g, non-mythic item slot is absolutely absurd. It is unhealthy and not interactive for the enemy team for multiple reasons:

During lane:

1. The moment someone returns to lane with a Hullbreaker against someone that can't itemize that, they immediately can no longer be pushed in on cannon waves in nearly all circumstances. This leaves the person without Hullbreaker in a position where no matter what, they will need to take bad recalls and fall behind in gold/xp. This item nullifies the enemy's ability to utilize fundamental aspects of League to stay even/secure a lead.
2. Hullbreaker is a stat-check item on majority of champs that use it. Not only do they lose control of the ability to wave control due to the difference in minion stats, but now a Hullbreaker wielder is free to basically do whatever they want. They take much less damage due to passive resistances, they care a lot less because they have that big health pool to oppress the enemy with, and they almost certainly do more damage because of the AD to top all that off. This item nullifies the need to play well in most cases. You have so many stats now, you can usually just run at your opponent and take every single trade and never lose. The 150% base health regen provided by Hullbreaker only makes these trades even more free.
3. Hullbreaker inadvertently ends in getting most if not all tower plates at a rate the opponent can not hope to. Add this to the way Hullbreaker forces the enemy to take bad recalls and you have a guaranteed snowball early, and without much effort.

Outside of lane:

1. All the way to level 18 this item keeps getting better and better. The longer the game goes on the more stats this item provides, and the more insane the minion buff passive is since siege minions scale infinitely into the late game.
2. A champ that has Hullbreaker nearly always HAS to be addressed by 2 or 3 of the strongest members of the enemy team (if they want to keep their towers). This level of pressure from one item creates huge windows for your team to do every other objective on the map.

&amp;#x200B;

**Counter argument time:**

* **""But Soulless, the only reason Hullbreaker is so good is because best bruiser item got nerfed!1!! (Sterak's Gage).""**

Sterak's and Hullbreaker have both always been strong, with the key difference being that no one figured out how good Hullbreaker was until after Sterak's got its nerf. It is not uncommon for an item to get added/reworked and have it's potential go unnoticed for a while since everyone is already so used to the meta being other things. Sterak's was just doing then what Hullbreaker is used for now: smothering your opponent with stats.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""**Cmon man, Hullbreaker is okay because the trade off is that you can't have teammates nearby and still get the max out of the push power!!""**

....really? If you're saying this you're missing the point of what makes this item so toxic in the first place. Have you ever seen a Hullbreaker Illaoi/Sion/Tryndamere/Yorick care they are just running it down lanes alone? A single player with this item exerts so much pressure by themselves, that's literally all they want to happen in the first place. Hullbreaker gamers want two things: tons of free gold/xp for themselves and tons of free objectives elsewhere while the enemy team sends multiple people to deal with the push. Outside of a few truly terrible inting Sions, I've never seen someone brainlessly running down sidelanes with a Hullbreaker by themselves be worse than the alternatives. The strat is just too good and too noninteractive for the opposition. Lose by not dealing with it or lose by dealing with it.

ALSO, even when grouped with teammates, this item is still roughly 120% gold efficient. You've still got a great item without all the insane stats the passive gives.

&amp;#x200B;

* **""Every bruiser item got nerfed hard, Hullbreaker is the only good buy for us now!!""**

Kind of like the first argument, but I feel it's separate enough.

Wow, the bruiser items got nerfed huh? Wonder why that is. So now, in order to deal damage top laners must commit to damage items/less tank, and to be tanky they have to commit to tank items/less damage? Hullbreaker is the only option left to freely oppress everyone else by doing both? That's called itemization, and it actually applies to all the other roles/playstyles. No one is sorry you can't build the same cookie cutter items every game and be impossible to kill while also dealing the most damage at the same time. No one cares Hullbreaker is the only option left to chase that high. Dealing with that is not fun for anyone else and exactly why Hullbreaker needs to be changed. The item creates an unfun, uninteractive experience for literally everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taking a look at League's past:**

Anyone here old enough to remember Banner of Command? I know, I know, time to go to bed grandpa. Riot removed that item because it was toxic to the state of the game: it was either niche and no one bought it or it was meta-warping. Sound familiar? It does to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**What did Banner of Command do?**

125% base health regeneration

60 Armor

30 Magic Resist

Active: Promote\*\*:\*\* Greatly increases the power of a lane minion, granting it 40% reduced damage from enemy champions, 100% **bonus** damage against turrets and bonus stats (some health and up to 100 armor, melee/caster minions get attack speed). (90 second CD)

Passive: P**oint Runner:** Builds up to 20% **bonus** movement speed over 2 seconds while near turrets, fallen turrets or Void Gates.

That's.... pretty underwhelming when compared to Hullbreaker. Every 3rd wave you got to give a minion of your choice half the stats that Hullbreaker currently does, and make it a little harder to kill for champs with the 40% damage reduction. But THAT was meta-warping enough to get removed.

Am I the only one seeing the similarities and differences here? I will admit that being able to get a 5 man banner on a wave was strong the one patch that people were doing that, but even then they had to commit as a team to that strategy and all waste an item slot they certainly could have used on anything better. So it kind of came out even. Hullbreaker gives minions double what BoC used to while also making the champion it's on obnoxiously strong at all stages of the game.

I'm sure there will be much more anger at this post/'well ackchually' in the comments than there will be those that sympathize but whatever. This item is unfun to play against at best, and completely game ruining at worst. Really wish Riot would take a look at the systems at play here and make adjustments.",4
2342,leagueoflegends,"I am a player that often takes longer breaks from the game. This is why I sometimes make my placements later in the season. My Account is level 234, the system should see that I am obviously no smurf, just a dude doing his placements. But the system placed me in smurf queue from the beginning on. I had to do nearly all my placements in it. From time to time there is a normal game but after a win I immediately get put back into smurf queue even though I rock a winrate under 50%. This is extremely frustrating especially for players coming back into the game. It takes away any motivation or joy to play the game. I bet there are many people like me that come back, get placed into smurf queue and lose motivation to continue playing the game and stop playing it again. Its really a big wall that is in front of you to start playing again and it shouldnt be like that.",4
2343,leagueoflegends,"Wondering why it’s gone, really wanted to watch this series, how can I watch it now that it’s gone?? Seemingly can’t find it anywhere",4

Hello r/leagueoflegends!

During last year I kept track of all soloq games I played with voice communication. Voice comms were made possible through a discord link to my server in champion select. I did not use discord link in every game and did not keep track of the games where people did not join for voice coms, but I would estimate that around 40% of the time someone joined to voice comms.

Currently there have been 325 players who have joined in 229 games. The games have been played in EUW in Diamond 2 - Master 300lp range. Majority of the time we have communicated in English, but there have been few exceptions. 4 times I have communicated in my native language Finnish and 6 times 2 players from same country joined and communicated in their native language between each other (2 French, 2 German, 1 Turkish and 1 Polish)

In games I played I have had around 53% win rate which is roughly 3% higher than my normal win rate. This is likely due to multiple factors but I think the main ones are.

* Improved ability to make snap calls around objectives, in fights and macro 

* Improved ability track enemy position in fog of war (Jungler and roaming Mid/Support)

* Ability to relieve tilt from players

* Ability to discuss game plan and power spikes

There have also been situations where a player joins to call but plays worse than normal (according to themselves) because they are not used to playing with voice comms, but majority of the time I think voice communications have improved chances of winning. This is especially true in situations where more than 2 or more players join to call.

There have also been some people with relatively heavy accents (mainly French) which has made broader discussions harder, still basic gameplay related discussion has always been fine because lingo used in League is pretty much the same around Europe and is not that difficult. 

Topic that often comes up when talking about voice comms in toxicity. In my games there have been surprisingly few cases of toxicity. Out of 325 there have been 4 players who I thought of kicked out of my server after the game and 1 player who I kicked during the game. There has also been 0 cases of griefing with players who have joined. Compering that to the amount of players who have been toxic/griefing outside of call in those same games, the trend comes even more noticeable. There have been over 80 people (~13%) in those games that have been reportable either from toxicity or griefing. I think the main reasons for this are.

* Talking to someone in voice comms humanises them and makes you less likely to be toxic

* There are less misunderstandings in game which leads to less tilt

* Toxic people are less likely to join voice comms 

Overall I think voice comms improve the quality of the game massively for me. That is mainly because gameplay with voice comms is usually better and people are usually quite chill in games I have played. I would love it if a system like champions queue would be added to EUW and it would allow players to play games with voice comms. I would also recommend testing out using voice comms in your soloq games a few times too so you can see if it improves your game quality too. All you need is to copy discord link to the voice channel and paste it in champion select.",4

2373,leagueoflegends,"The pain of grinding from silver 4 0lp to Gold promos by gaining 12-13 lp and loosing 14-16 lp. No mater how long my win streaks are, The LP gain stays the same. Sure is not made easy xD",4
2374,leagueoflegends,"Posting this here because most of my friends abandoned the game long ago and I just need to get it out.

So, I had a very long 14 hour day of work yesterday, and against my better judgment decided to play some ranked. I was autofilled jungle, which although not my favorite role, is fine. But then I realize Lee Sin is banned - I was a OTP of him long ago so he is my only comfortable jungle.

In a panic, I picked Kha'Zix. And almost immediately proceeded to die 5 times in 8 minutes. Team starts flaming and spamming ""15"", as one does.

Normally, the toxicity from chat would make me care so much less about the game, but something funny started to happen. First, I stole a dragon. Team is still silent and trying to early FF.

But then, I stole another. And another. And a Baron. Next thing you know, we hold on long enough to win through Elder and a 40 minute Jinx, with me ending 5/14 total.

And let me tell you, /r/leagueoflegends , it was the most fun I have had with this game in a long time. 9x were raging everywhere! My team was flaming me, each other, and the other team. The other team was doing exactly the same - just absolutely trashing each other, me, their lane opponents.

At the end, there were about 3 ""Fuck all of you"" type goodbyes, and one ""This was the worst game of LoL I've ever played"".

I have no idea what that guy was going on about. That game was fun as hell.",4

2379,leagueoflegends,"Hello everyone, as I spent time on Reddit I saw people asking how and where one could go about watching League E-Sports, so I decided to give it a try and do it in a video format:

[https://youtu.be/Y4-3sVlFVy8](https://youtu.be/Y4-3sVlFVy8)

So far I've made 2 with that being the most recent one, I plan on making as many as I can before MSI, but I know I wont be able to cover all the topics I want before then, and that is to say that I will be covering various topics, and divide them into specific videos, so it doesn't get too confusing.

This one is about Neutral Objective, those in the river to be more specific, so if you want to know about them, I think this video will help.

As for those of you who already know enough about the game, I would like to get your opinion on the video and about the presentation and how well/badly you think I explained it.

**MVP: IW Ferret**

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations, fastPay Wildcats! They have gained their ticket to Grand Finals with Galatasaray Esports for another ticket, which is for MSI!

&amp;#x200B;

Well... that was brutal for AUR, i hope they dont get demoralized because of this match.

Huge team diff, mentally and individually IW was far better than AUR. 

71-15 kills overall, oh man.

&amp;#x200B;

IW always has been a team that reads meta perfectly, they are doing it again. This team always makes plays and oh boy, it is entertaining to watch them. They dont care what team you are, they will play their game and wont just sit and scale for 40 minutes. Literal LPL style team. Serin and Ferret are a menacing duo, HolyPhoenix is cracked as hell like last year when he was going toe to toe against doggo and farfetch's agression with him grants them pure dominance in botlane as always. Not gonna mention Starscreen, dude is a rare piece. He can play everything all fine and well, such an  underrated toplaner in TCL.

&amp;#x200B;

As for AUR, they got outclassed so hard. Elramir and Jool are their main weapons, but looks like IW mid jung duo shut them down and AUR cant do anything without these two.

&amp;#x200B;

Grand Final will be between reigning champion Galatasaray Espor and fastPay Wildcats, good luck to both of them!

I understand the reason is shorter q times but I don't work for riot; it is NOT MY RESPOSIBILITY to play an off-role for atleast 20 mins just so riot can have shorter q times. I just wanted to play a mage mid, I could I guess deal with getting it top lane, but getting auto filled jg twice while not even being in q for 3 mins just makes me not play the game for the day. Its like Riot literally just expects everyone to be so addicted to this game that they will still play when they don't want to. Now for like a week straight I've tried to play league, not get the role I want and just play a different game instead because I'm not playing league to play league I'm playing it to play mid.",4

I had 9 Gemstones before, now I have 100 mythic essence, but dreadnova darius is... gone.

AFAIK gemstone skins rotate every 3 months, so I guess it will be like 2 years before the skin is unvaulted.... is there any calender or vote which skin gets unvaulted next so I can at least rest in peace knowing it will take until 2025 and stop hoping it will be this year.",4
2392,leagueoflegends,"So I've been playing league on EUW server quite casually, reached a pretty average p3 53% WR which is not high MMR at all and also not even smurf Queue cuz its a fairly average WR. I dont say that because I want to flex on silver players, but more to elaborate on why this situation is so dumb.   
For the past few days my queue times have gone up to over 20-25minutes every time I try to get into a soloQ game - with the best one being over 1hour queue on a Sunday 2pm (which is what I'd consider a pretty good time for playing).

2394,leagueoflegends,"Hi, first sorry for my bad english ...   


Second, this morning, i waked up and go for some ""normal game"" on my main account aswell as low level smurf, and after a couple of game this question came to me ... Why do riot keep calling it ""Normal"" draft or blind ?  
I mean i have nothing agaisnt weird strategies (unless they are really to play the game and not just ruining fun of your teammates) but are afks, bots, hardly toxic new account and huge lvl gap are ""normal"" to this game ? because i got at least 2 of those item in every game this morning ...  
Why does riot just dont rename it ""unranked"" ? why do they dont try to do something againts those behaviours event if that games are not really ""important"" ?   


Maybe it was just a bad day for me, but i play this game for 10 years overall (i had some break for sure but i keep consider it as my main game and i always get back to it). And today its the first time in 5-6 normal game i never get any kind of fun at all ... for the past year, funny moment in normal game seems to be more and more rare ... i have the feeling that now flex are the place to get the fun i used to get in ""normal"" game back to S4-5-6 ... but did i have to try new champ and build in a suppose to be ""serious"" ranked queue ?   


Well Thank you for reading my useless contribution but i had to talk about it \^\^

2395,leagueoflegends,"Hello guys! I’m back with another summary for what happened this week in the LPL! The single elimination portion of the playoffs is done and only the top four teams of the region remain. There were stomps, there were back and forths, and there were so many exciting moments that if you haven’t watched the games, then make sure you take a look at the vods or highlights! 

The four remaining teams are: 

* V5 (Rich, Karsa, Rookie, Photic, ppgod)
* RNG (Bin, Wei, Xiaohu, GALA, Ming)
* TES (Wayward/Zoom, Tian/Xiaopeng, Knight, Jackeylove, Mark/Zhuo)
* JDG (369, Kanavi, Yagao, Hope, Missing)

V5 and RNG made it to the top four by finishing first and second place during the regular season. Meanwhile, both TES and JDG made it through the single elimination gauntlet. It feels good to see the 2020 Summer and Spring champion teams come back to form even if the teams aren’t quite the same. 

But let’s go back a bit and take a look at how we got here. 

The first round of the playoffs began with BLG and RA facing off on one side of the bracket while EDG and FPX fought on the other side. Both series ended up being 3-1 victories for BLG and EDG that were relatively clean. Unfortunately for both teams, things didn’t end up going so well in the second when both teams ended up on the receiving end of the loss against TES and WBG. Just like that, the 2021 Worlds championship team and the supposed LPL superteam were out of contention for both playoffs and MSI. 

It’s a bit shocking, but that’s just how it goes. Teams have vastly improved rosters from 2021 and it seems like EDG running their’s back just wasn’t good enough. On BLG’s side, coordination was simply too big of an issue even with big names on the roster.

TES then went on to take down LNG in dominant fashion, achieving a 3-0 sweep against them. Meanwhile, the series between WBG and JDG went to a full five game series that went back and forth. Ultimately, JDG came out as the victor after out-drafting their opponents in a dominant game 5.

That’s pretty much how things went without getting too bogged down by the details. Now that we’ve reached this point in the split, I’m curious. Which team in the top 4 are you rooting for and why? And again thanks for reading my short recap! There’ll be a week break for the LPL as teams with COVID are sorting things out, but I’ll be back again before the Grand Final with more! ",4
2396,leagueoflegends,"FIY: *Divers* are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

For years i have been playing league around G4 in EUW. I am getting more and more annoyed by the level of play i am watching. Sure i make mistakes, sure my mechanics are plain bad sometimes. Sure i get greedy. 

But it seems people around me either tilt for no reason, or they have no idea where to be on the map, The first type i cant do much about, but the second is just a lack of knowledge. 

I have written a few words to provide you with some insights in the game i have gotten over the years:

- not banned too much

So I understand that Yorick isn't that great of a champion in high elo, however in the matches I play he feels basically unstoppable.

Q : Almost the same breach's aftershock but longer, stun but dealt less damage maybe like 30-60 damage ?

C : Amplifie her bullet with electric and dealt extra damage and slow the enemy for a certain amount of time
X : Zeri charges herself for about 1.5 sec and stun and slow all enemy nearby in a certain radius around her and also disable all trap a certain amount of time 


Neon on league of legends:-
Q : Neon throw out a bolt of lightning that can bounce from that slow and after a few seconds stun the enemy for a certain period of time
W : Neon pull out a non physical electric wall/lane that in increase her movement speed while in the wall/lane, also the wall/lane will slow and deal damage to enemy hit by it
E : Neon increase her movement speed and cost mana over but can be cancelled and neon will slide her next basic attack will be enhanced
R: For the X second neon can lock on an enemy and blast with electric lazer(kinda like urgot's E) and deal substantial amount of damage on the lock enemy",4

I buy recommended items, main support characters who's backstories I like, and am mainly in this for the lore and the pretty colors.  However, when I play, and I played a game about six months ago, I got nothing but toxic nonsense scolding me about not knowing the meta and the usual hate for a low tier support.

My confidence has gone through the roof and I’m doing way better in school getting tons of emails from colleges and more opportunities for my future. I’ve become more confident and have now been able to start talking with so many different people and make so many new friends. Still I play league almost everyday and having fun all while doing it. League has genuinely improved my life and may have altered my path in life to be more positive. I love this game and now I love my life.

2496,leagueoflegends,"Hello Reddit,

I'd like to ask how common losing streaks are and how to avoid/prevent them from happening. I am asking because I lost 7 games in a row today in gold elo. I am a dedicated player who's climbing the ranked ladder through watching educational League content like coaching videos. My main role is jungle. 

Now I believe my situation is as follows. There is nearly never toxicity in my champ select screen. So that's good. But when the game timer hits 2 min, a player dies. Within 5 minutes, all my lanes have usually died 1-2 times. This is not an exaggeration. I used to play champions like Nocturne and Shyvana. I'd gank when my R was off cooldown. Now I play Elise and Vi to gank a lot, so I can impact my lanes. However, with people dying before I can even finish my clear, that's not nearly as easy. They die 1v1 or 2v2 bot. No impact from the enemy jungler whatsoever. Then at 10 minutes into the game, everyone has died 3 times or so. And I get blamed. 

I talk to my teammates in a friendly way. I tell them to play safe, as any jungler would. Usually river isn't warded, so I tell them to ward too. They proceed to feed. Still (nearly) no impact from the enemy jungler. Lanes are losing against their opponents fair and square. They tilt, they rage, they blame it on me for not ganking a 4-0 Samira - Lulu or something. And I am to believe I am actually in losers queue. Because I have watched replays to see what I could've done differently early game and it's not much. Games are really over at 10 minutes and never in my favour. The behaviour of my teammates is terrible too. They're incredible toxic. They talk about running it down and they do. They AFK. They shadow me in the game just to take my camps. 7 games in a row. Again, no exaggeration. I just do not have an impact. These past games I felt really bad. What can I do to better my gameplay or at least avoid teammates like this? I will disable chat from now on to stay sane.

I appreciate any help. Thanks.",4
