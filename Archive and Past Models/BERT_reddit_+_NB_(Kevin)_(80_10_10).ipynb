            "I feel like I'am more bitter when it involves pokemon. Its sad because i don't want to be but I just have the desire and gut feeling to be grumpy over certain things. I love gen 6 so much yet its not my favorite gen even with all this amazing work put into it by gamefreak. Yet, instead of putting my anger to rest, I have become more bitter lately. My least favorite \"fan\" group (genwunners) have pretty much died out, yet I'am still grumpy. I should be happy that Xy has brought back players and this sub reddit has like 100,00 new users. I think the things I'am mostly angry about is the lack of 5th gen megas and how Charizard has two megas. I hated Charizards overrated popularity back in 5th gen, but when I saw his megas, I freaking loved them and roared as happy as any fan. Now I'am back to hating more than ever even though I like his megas but the fact that gamefreak gave him two just because he is Charizard pisses me off now. I feel like a hyprocrite since my favorite mega is Blaziken and I should be more angry that no other Hoenn starter got a mega, but instead I'am angry at something I should have put back in the past. Then I'am mostly angry about no 5th gen megas. To have my favorite gen to not get megas is understandably acceptable to get a little a mad over, but I feel like I hate that truth more than I should. Its probaby because the reasons I loved 5th gen. It was the gen people judged too harshly based on one or two pokemon that were controversial and automatically the worst gen to others. I loved this gen mostly because of darker story and the excellent pokemon but it also reminded me of 3rd gen, the gen that started in a time when pokemon stopped being a fad and was seen as childish. I was bullied for years just because I still loved Pokemon and I remember kids just a year ago who would exclude me from pokemon groups even when they still liked pokemon in gen 3 would a year later would exclude me from having a normal day at school just because I still loved pokemon. I saw 5th gen as the bullied kid that was me and the people who downright hated it for no good reason were the bullies. I think if I play around with Charizard I might see something about Charizard I might like and hopefully not be bitter. I don't want be that pokemon fan that will be toxic and hateful.

At the end of the game Fizz and his real life friend Kennen said to all the players in the post match chatroom \"Report Lee Sin for flaming\". The Red team not knowing what happened in the in-game chat agreed to report Lee Sin. This happened to Lee Sin several times,  enough times for him to referred to the Tribunal. However the LoL community at the Tribunal would vote for Lee Sin to be pardoned. However Fizz gets away with nothing as every time he flamed he got lucky and no one reported him. If the Red could view the in-game chat of both teams at the end of the each game, the Red team may have reported Fizz for flaming.
