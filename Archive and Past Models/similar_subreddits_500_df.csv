4,gaming,"For me, the two things that come to mind are unbalanced characters/weapons etc in multiplayer games, and random encounters in RPGs.

As for balancing, I've found that most of the time the effects of the overpowered thing are usually not that detrimental to overall play, and often times the resulting patches totally overcorrect for it. Often times the ""unbalanced"" abilities actually serve to make the overall game have more dynamism and variety, since they force players to actually change their strategy and ensure a tangible difference between choices that the players make. good example of this is many of the guns in cod4. some guns like the m16, mp5, deagle and m40a3 are objectively better than many of their counterparts, and others, such as the shotguns, lower level SMGs and LMGs are by most metrics worse than the average gun. this combined with the map design actually forces players to switch the guns that they're using depending on the situation, rather than having 30 weapons that all have relatively comparable damage and can be used on every map. 

even though i don't play RPGs very often at all, whenever i do play games such as ff7 and pokemon i never really have a big issue with persistent random encounters. if the combat system is fun enough, i can stomach the grinding.",0

15,gaming,"Hello there, this post isn't about me but my father who is addicted to a certain strategy game that he's been playing for 5 years now.

It gets worse with each year, he doesn't want to hear anything about it because he LOVES the game - just a bit too much.

He's in a huge gaming guild and plays a minimum of 8 hours EVERY DAY! 24/7. (Likely even more since we of course don't know what hes doing at work) I don't live at my parents anymore since I'm 22 now but my mother hates it.

He not only wasts immense amounts doing nothing else but the same shit over and over again, since its a built up genre game and they always do events, essentially the game itself only exists because of people like him, so called Whales, the game has become a fundamental part of his life like he's a cocain addict and he basically has spent up to 10000 dollars on this fucking game.

I'm not kidding he might have even low balled that number, since he gets payed 25k per year (which isnt a lot) but he has like no money saved.

And my mother freaked out and I'm kinda banged over the head too, it also attacks his physical and mental health. Hes just 50 and has signs of Alzheimers already.

A few months ago my mother gave him 3000€ and it was gone after a week....

After a week.

And he can't answer where the money is only makes excuses.

What pisses us off are the strangers he added to whatsapp and seemingly has actual contact with.

They reach from social welfare fatasses, to low wage commoners like him and even business owners. 

And they are all like him: Whales.

One of them, the guild leader is literally the lord of Whales. I don't know about him personally besides that my father told me he's a wealthy man and currently doesnt play as often because he's in hospital for some shit, diabetes or whatever the fuck. As the guild leader he kinda has ingame power over all the other whales so my mother made the theory up that guy is not a millionair but lying and using his guild power to get money out of my dad and others.

And information, it creeped me out to know that some ingame stranger knows about ME and what I do! My father is a blabbering mouth full, so its my problem too now.

The guy has the adresses, names, telephone numbers, alias, family information etc. of supposedly all high ranking members.

He's also max level, which supposedly isn't even possible, even my dad says so once. You essentially have to play the game like around the clock to make max level.

I checked his account out and pi times finger the dude has like 25000 € (26000 $) of special items just standing on his island alone.

It got me thinking hes like a drug lord but dealing with ingame items and power rather than being on the streets dealing crack.

What can we do? Is there any way still possible to stop my dad wasting money or playing his lifetime off by clicking on the same 10 virtual buildings every fucking day???",0

Smogon in particular is great because the tiering system means nearly every Pokemon in existence has at least a niche use in some tier. Even the worst of the worst, like Regigigas and Slaking, can be used in the lower tiers.

It allows for a lot more diversity and thoughtful teambuilding. You can create a near infinite number of unique and fun teams.",0

28,gaming,"I've been ruminating over what made my personal experience with Elden Ring so frustrating and oppressive as compared to previous From titles.

Having spent years of my life steeped in the Souls experience, it felt strange being back in a place where I was refusing to engage with the necessary mechanics, genuinely refusing to learn and overcome obstacles as I had done countless times before.


I honestly couldn't understand why I had this reaction. It was like my first time with the series all over again in all the worst ways; As if Elden Ring itself were a sending gate to a time before countless pivotal ""git gud"" moments and I was, once again, gnashing my teeth in confusion and despair.

At first, I assumed I had just gotten old. Life had done it's thing. I no longer had the patience to dedicate my aptitude to such frivolities. But I couldn't work out the specific mechanism by which such a change could have occured.

I'm still relatively young, I thought. In my heart, I still believe that Video Games are the future of high art and the dominant medium for storytelling in the 21st century. Storytelling is an inseparable aspect of the human experience.

Was there really so much different about me, that I could no longer feel driven toward such enviable ends?

No. Or, at least, I genuinely could not believe it to be so.


For weeks, I've wondered about this disturbing feeling of difference that came over me when stepping through a fog wall in the lands between.

What follows is merely what occurs to me, an assuredly incomplete accounting of what may be amiss. 

Dark Souls came at a time when our world and culture were utterly intoxicated; in a post-WWII malaise of nigh-unprecedented peace and order. This allowed a consumer culture to take hold with it's promise of ever-encroaching comfort and pleasure.

Abdication became commonplace as we bowed before the majesty of ease. We'd excised the rich, complicated experience of struggle and, along with it, our capacity to make meaning. The modern world had gone hollow, cold and dark. It's founding flame had faded, resulting in what could most readily be described as atrophy of our very souls.


**I want to briefly qualify this analysis with the following context:** 

People struggle all over the world, every day. There is no shortage of human suffering in the 21st century or any other. What I am talking about is the devaluation of our experience of struggle and it's place in culture.


Souls offered counter-programming, which criticized our complacency with it's very existence. The idea that there was industry-leading design out there, locked behind this experience of hardship that genuinely rewarded antiquated ideals like humility and self discipline was too enticing to ignore.

From found a way to lure a group of people (gamers) who spend most of their lives avoiding the exquisite pain of life's rigors, back into the fray.

Even if purely by chemical means, they brought a lot of us back to a place that humanity had almost forgotten, where through absolute hopelessness, one could finally find freedom.


Here, at what in many ways feels like the end of a journey, we come to Elden Ring. From software calls down another esoteric, relentless deluge upon the masses, only this time we were already soaking wet.

Many have had it worse than me over the past few years. If you're lucky enough to have the time and means to read this ludicrous post, you can probably say the same.

Between the steep decline in quality of human leadership, our long-term prospects as a species that still has a natural habitat and the resurgent prospects of war and pestilence, it feels like the experience of hardship is about to retake it's throne.

Over a decade after From Software bit it's thumb at our rotting culture of ease and comfort, I doubt many of us still feel the warm buzz they sought to dispell.

The experience of hardship that From Software works so hard to realize is no longer refreshing to me, because it is no longer alien.

My time spent galloping through a bloody hell called Caelid at early levels, with no bearing on any notion of progress is something I will forever cherish. Still, the feeling that place engendered in me can no longer be described as a welcome shift in mindset. More often, it stoked something smoldering within my psyche that I'd been trying to smother.


I think this conflict is at the heart of a lot of souls veterans' frustrating experience with Elden Ring. It genuinely feels like we're on the cusp of true struggle the likes of which we've never seen and for which we are ill-prepared. Our blood is up, tempers are short and sometimes it feels like all we can do is sit back wait for shit to get real.

With that kind of apprehension permeating our culture in 2022, the experiential anti-escapism of Elden Ring feels like it's ideologically beating a dead horse.

Today, many of us no longer feel like superheroes in desperate need of a reality check. Instead, you might say we feel tarnished and hollow; our purpose in time being merely to witness and weather some storm a hundred years or more in the making.

I will forgive myself for laying down that burden every once in a while and seeking rest in the games that I play.

I admire this masterpiece and the artists who dedicated years of their lives to making it a reality. They had something to say and where others only whisper, they shouted it from the mountaintops of giants.

It's not their fault that I can no longer stand to listen. Elden Ring may be my last souls game. If it is, it was a hell of a send off. I don't look at it as giving up. I see that once upon a time, I'd forgotten something precious to me. Dark Souls made me remember.

Good luck to you all.",0

53,gaming,"Hi all!

This  is kind of sub related.  I'm looking for a sandbox 3D simulating  building game that could work  as a planning tool for my house, garden  and surrounding area. Nothing  fancy, but I just need to be able to  change the ground levels put up some trees, make a pool, place a custom  formed house and other various  buildings, etc - in first person to be able to  move around and get the general  idea of the design.

Long  time ago,  I know people used Sims to build and come up with ideas of  their own  house. But it isn't first-person and the game is... well old...

Minecraft would be like the perfect game for this, except that the graphics isn't optimal.

I tried using Valheim but it doesn't include a real sandbox environment.

After  googling a bit, I  found a game called Paralives that might be what I'm   looking for, except that it hasn't been released yet.

Instead   of buying expensive simulation applications that are dumb, I rather   invest in a game that can basically do the same thing, with proper  controls and UI.

Any ideas of a game that is or include a sandbox mode with these type of features?",0

78,gaming,"I've never played a game (not even Wasteland) that felt as much like the original two Fallout games as The Weird West feels. This game is so much fun, and gives you freedom to play pretty much however you like. The world map travel with random encounters and discoverable locations is very reminiscent of Fallout, as are the companions you can bring along. The only real gameplay changes are that the combat is real-time action rather than turn based (a very positive change) and the camera is not at a fixed angle but can be rotated 360 degrees. Speaking of the combat, it is just slow enough that you can be tactical, while fast enough that you aren't able to easily outmaneuver every foe. Some of the occult horrors, in particular, are much faster than your human enemies, and completely change the way you approach combat.

Speaking of occult horrors, I am also an aficionado of the pencil and paper game this is based on (also called The Weird West), and the video game keeps the sinister, Lovecraftian horror of the pencil and paper game alive and well in the storytelling.

The reputation system feels similar to Fallout's ""karma"" system, and every character you meet (including key plot characters) can be killed, pickpocketed, or talked to. Many will need help or offer money for your goods or services.

Personally, I think this game is fun as fuck. The first time I shot the dynamite out of an outlaw's hand as he tried to throw it at me and he blew into little bits I laughed out loud. Probably because I'm a bad person. That's not the point. The point is that the designers really made this game open-ended in terms of what actions you can take. Blow open boarded up doors with dynamite? Sure. Shoot an oil lamp to start a fire and trap your enemies? Yes. Turn off that same lamp instead to lure an enemy over so you can choke them out from behind? That, too. Several times I've thought to myself ""I wonder if I can do *this*..."" only to find out that, yes, I can! 

Once, I got caught stealing from a house, so rather than suffer the reputation loss, I murdered the witness. Reputation salvaged. Another time I thought I'd done the same thing, but someone else had seen me just prior to my crimes, and since I was a stranger in those parts, they put 2 and 2 together and my rep took a major hit. Smart gameplay.

Anyway, I wanted to share my experience with you fine people. I'm a few hours in now and just having a grand old time. It's very compelling gameplay with a dark and twisted plot. Looting is fun and rewarding, and unlike most games of this sort, the consumables are in constant use because of how plentiful and powerful they are. For anyone with game pass like me, it's on there which is why I checked it out in the first place. Have fun!",0

...OK not everything, but Ive played a lot that broadly fell into one of five categories:

Played to death because I loved them so much I couldn't put them down (Control, Valheim, SS13, jrpg games I suppose, Conan exiles, gacha games, No Mans Sky, , Fallout 4, Skyrim, gmod, Fez, Wipeout, Elden ring, soulsborne games, stardew, Generation Zero, Just Cause series, Ruiner, Noita and many more)

Played for a bit and already beaten and  put down because I got bored (Outer Worlds,Doom, Trove, tera, Deus Ex, Metal Gear Solid V and many many many more)

Played and dropped almost immediately because I just didn't click with it at all (Witcher  3, path of exile, Assassins Creed Valhalla, Lost ark (jsut cause by design it’s time senstitive asf and it’s not good game to play if you’re somebody who works on a full time job),  and so on)

Played and loved but eventually put down because the game beat me (Frost Punk, cities Skyline, don’t starve, Project Zomboid, and others that are probably too embarrassing to mention)

Never played/Played once or twice because I felt like these require friends and sometiwms can get boring ish (Warzone/Apex/Hunt/COD)

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for anything but right now I'd love a arcade game that makes me keep playing  (pretty much like if you go to arcade Game Center in the mall something like thah you know what I mean) which has me actively play it something  that isn't a game that is somehow felt like a part time  job (ahem mmos tbh) and maybe something that has character progression through loot/skill tree.

I do however want to avoid teen games (Life is Strange), uninspired design (Little Nightmares, yawn, Inside was better), shoddy unenjoyable controls and comic crossovers (I couldn't be less excited by a Marvel game or anything with Batman in).

121,gaming,"The video game Prototype and Alex Mercer has inspired me to feel more comfortable being myself and become stronger physically and mentally. The story is incredible and I love how the Web of Intrigue adds to the overall story. The game is extremely violent, but I feel that the feeling of absolute chaos and mayhem add to the story and how awesome Alex Mercer is. I love this game and I'm so glad it was on sale on the PS store for $5. I just find the world of Prototype to be very empowered me. Alex Mercer inspired me to feel empowered and I love Prototype for that reason. Even after you played the game, you still feel powerful.

He's a very lonely guy and I like how the game conveys his loneliness considering he is the Blacklight Virus and he can't be around anyone without being a complete danger to them. He's extremely powerful and a badass on his own though, and that is what makes him empowering for me. He doesn't need to rely on anyone and he's a total powerhouse.

It may not be on the top ten games of all-time. But the impact of the overall experience is still ahead of its time in my opinion. Love this game and Alex Mercer's character.",0

-reinstalling Valorant

I also tried reinstall vanguard and Valorant opened but said that I need restart the computer after the restart Valorant still didn't start",0
143,gaming,"Honestly, when I saw Exoprimal during the showcase, I was a bit excited. I initially thought it had to do with Pragmata since the set looked the same, albeit brighter, but I wasnt overly disappointed...until I found out what type of game it was after.

Typically, multiplayer or coop games in general are not my thing. Im not adverse to playing them, but when it comes down to a decision for what Im going to be spending my time and money on, multiplayer centric games are usually not at the top of the list, let alone a 5v5v1, which Ive kinda always thought was a weird genre.

Regardless though, the game looked cool. I was drawn in because it looked like it has a lot of potential. Its got the awesome personalized mech, Anthem style designs, the trailer gameplay looked like it had almost Monster Hunter-esque heavy, yet swift combat, and quite frankly I think I and everyone else could see remnants of the assets from the canceled Dino Crisis game (articles stated back in 2020) from the red headed character to the updated dinosaur looks. From all cylinders it looks legitimately fun.

However, my issue with it stems not from my usual avoiding multiplayer games, because I do still play some from time to time if I really enjoy them, or they catch my eye, but from Capcoms spotty history with online centric titles. Capcom doesnt have the best record with support for these kinds of things unless your names are Street Fighter or Monster Hunter, and even then those two franchises have strong single player cores at heart, while this is promisingly to be solely requiring more than one person. Even Capcoms own Resident Evil franchise, another heavy hitter of theirs, hasnt faired too well with online, its latest tragedies being RE: Verse which still hasnt seen the light of day despite having a couple of betas and supposed to be released during launch day of RE8, and Resistance pretty much dying within weeks of its release.

Given that it makes it hard to get excited for a potentially online only title that could vanish just as quickly as it came if the fan reception isnt there day one, but also since Capcom still isnt as experienced in making multiplayer only games that are success' it makes it hard to want to get too invested. Maybe it if did with what Monster Hunter does it gave it scaling difficulty, or a solo (and I mean solo without bots) as a separate mode an option I could see this fairing better. But so far, until we learn more Ill have to keep a watchful eye.",0

179,gaming,"Hello Reddit!

Small disclaimer: Englisch is not my native language so apologies for mistakes in advance!

I used to be a big fan of MMORPGs an for the most parts I still am. Basically I played a lot of years WoW aswell as FFXIV. I also basically play genshin impact since release and recently started to play Lost ark just to see if I like it. Lost ark is really a nice game that cought my attention now on to the personal problem I have. I think I really have a tendency to wanting to spend irl money on those games and while I know this itself is not a problem of you don't overdo it, it still bothers me a bit. 

I have spend some money on genshin (now I know I am not even considered a whale but I play the game for around 1.5 years and have spend maybe 300 euro plus the monthly subscription, give or take some bucks). I don't regret spending the money since I really enjoyed the excitement I had from getting a nice drop or my bf beeing happy for me when I got a husbando there but the constant possibility of spending more money to get something always pops up in my head. 

I got this feeling lately with Lost ark too since there is this cute cat pet with a crown in the auction house that's not available anywhere else and I was calculating how expensive would be to buy it. I earn good money so I. Theory that's not the problem bit it started to bother me that those thoughts keep popping up in my head especially when things like this are constantly available for me. I did some quest and kept thinking about the store and the pet and stuff like this it just made me enjoy the game a lot less cause my mind was wandering. Then FOMO started aswell in between cause who knows maybe this cat will never be available again in the store. I just felt so tired by it eventho I liked the genre itself so much it tired and exhausted me.
Please I am not hating on any game mechanics or on the existence  of the stores I know a lot of people are totally fine with that. It's just a personal problem I have lately and I was curious if someone else experienced the same and found a solution for this.

Or is there any MMORPGs where you just have to buy the game one time and then you can play it without any microtransactions? I saw a bit of new world but it didn't had any cute pets or mounts so I thought that's not fitting and o have no clue if new age would have microtransactions in the game as well. Maybe anyone has an idea or even just other points of views or experiences are appreciated :)

My picks:

Super Mario World: One of the best platformers ever released. Great, colorful graphics. Great music and tight controls. Except for the low resolution it just feels modern in so many ways. So much creativity in the levels, and the game is very forgiving.

Doom: Preferably with one of the mods that upgrade the resolution/graphics and adds mouse look. Fast, arcadey gameplay with interesting monsters and some abstract level design that you don't see anymore. This one is also very easy to pick up and play.

F-Zero GX: The difficulty might not be for everybody, but you don't have to play story mode. This game has some wonderful 60fps fast paced racing with really precise controls. The game never got any sequels, because it was already perfect.

Baldur's Gate 2: Maybe the least accessible on this list, as it feels pretty old school and almost requires some knowledge about the D&amp;D 2nd edition ruleset. Played the enhanced edition is prefered, because of some much needed QoL improvements. What is so special about this game is that it was made before roleplaying games really got steamlined.

240,gaming,"Admittedly, I am more or less completely ignorant of everything in this franchise between the original game from 20 years ago and *Infinite*, but the portrayal of the UNSC as some sort of quasi-fascist military dictatorship that wages war against human civilians for corporate interests, orders the execution of innocent teenagers without reservation, and controls Spartans though drugs and brainwashing seems a bit…off to me. In the games I’ve played, the Spartans and the UNSC were clearly the good guys and there was no hint of any of this darker aspect to them. Sure, Master Chief is cybernetically enhanced and has had to sacrifice some element of his humanity to be able to do his job, but this? It seems to be taking things much farther and drawing elements from other sci-fi series and films with a much more cynical attitude towards the military than Halo has historically had. Is there something in the games that I’m just not aware of that makes this depiction accurate, or is this just your typical Hollywood political bullshit being awkwardly tacked onto a popular game franchise because they can’t be assed to come up with something original?",0

1) [ConnecTank](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1597200/ConnecTank/) This one is based around conveyor management, and ammo-matching combat. Fairly simple, but easily can get hectic with the randomized floor layouts, the different enemies, and, later on, having to manage switching between cannons, dealing with monsters, and other things. For $30, maybe wait for a sale, but I think it's worth it.

2) [Dead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/527150/Dead/) A top-down shooter boss-rush game with each boss having different mechanics, increasing difficulty, and some enemies are extra unnerving. Worth a try, especially for the fairly cheap price.

3) [The Void Rains Upon Her Heart](https://store.steampowered.com/app/790060/The_Void_Rains_Upon_Her_Heart/) A side-scroller schmup with a fairly good rogue-like enhancement system, and uses a good mix of enemies and attack patterns to keep you on your toes, with a good risk/reward system.

4) [Crumble](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061180/Crumble/) You're a rolling, blue sphere with a grapple-tongue, and you have one goal: Go fast, and get to the goal. Simple idea, really nice graphical style, and can be extremely hard, especially with how fast you can go.

Hi everyone,

Question: **Does anyone have any advice on how to tweak settings to get rid of/reduce the bright flash from spells?**

Background: I have been loving Elden Ring so far and I am currently running a full strength character and a Dex/Int spell caster. I mostly enjoy the spell caster (I am not very good at melee and for PVE I personally find I have an easier time with it) BUT I have photosensitivity issues (bright lights abnormally effect my eyes). A lot of the spells in Elden Ring have pretty bright flash effects for me. Think of glintstone pebble, when the spell is cast there is a bright blue flash out of the staff and that flash does not feel good for me. Or the Moonlit Katana has the bright blue flash from its' abilities.

I have standard settings I use for games such as lower brightness, contrast, and blue light filters. I have Elden Ring as dark as it can comfortably be right now but I do not clearly understand all the video settings or what could help to stop this.

Thank you all so much in advance!",0

306,gaming," Hi all,

I know, another one of these posts! I apologise, please don't be mad! I just needed some other opinions from people who might have been in the PC gaming market longer than me.

I've got a Ryzen 9 5900x, RTX 3080 PC and a PS5 with a 4K OLED TV, I have friends split between both, but we don't really play together much as we're all into our single player stuff more than anything. I play mostly SP, AAA games but I am starting to get into sim racing, but yet to make the purchase of a decent wheel and pedals.

I was always under the impression that if you were willing to wait, PC gaming was expensive in the short term with the purchase of hardware, but cheaper when buying games, but it doesn't seem to be the case now? Unless you're willing to go and buy a CD key from Greenman Gaming etc.

So, I'm looking for opinions on where you'd play primarily if you were in my shoes? Neither are really cheap these days with hardware shortages, online subs etc. Most games come to PC as well as console, apart from PS exclusives, a few third party games and Nintendo games, so I'm struggling to make a decision! It sounds silly, I fully aware of that, but the way my brain is wired, I have to have a single platform I play majority of my games on, so looking for peoples opinions.",0

Gameplay in DS is definitely more dated since it's a remake from a 2009 game but still not too dated to play nowadays, it's still smooth and has many unique mechanics that are separated from the Dark Souls franchise. ER provides lots of gameplay value but at the same time I felt overwhelmed and the open world aspect felt flat for me personally.

When we buy something into these games (in-app purchases) or just buying the game itself and eventually they'll shockingly announce that they're shutting down the game, where does our money go? 
I'll take Angry Birds Epic as an example. It has multiple premium items in the shop that can be bought with real money to make your characters stronger. Suddenly it got removed from the Appstore/GooglePlay.

386,gaming,"This is probably one of those moments where i kind of have to talk about a game because the concept excited me so much. Quantum Break, in my opinion, is a very unique game to play. The visuals, even on medium due to bad optimization for my hardware, are superb. The effects of time and causality cracking apart, the effects of time and space imploding after a Time Stop, the sparks bouncing off slowly when you shoot something in a stutter. It's all just beautiful.

Jack Joyce, the main character, is generic. Just another action hero. Cheap one liners, because overpowered within minutes, al that good stuff. It's the antagonist, Paul Serene, who to me  makes this story work.

He's built the opposing faction to Joyce, he's seen the end of everything. The world stopped in time.  He's afraid of it. He wants to prevent it, but he has to go back. He realizes he can't prevent it because it has already happened, and what has happened cannot be undone. The same people meet, the same people die, the same people are in the same place. Time does not change. Paul Serene knows and has seen this. But he's only seen the end result and key points, he doesn't know details. He's seen the consequences of his actions and orders and what arises from them alone. He doesn't know what or why other people do in their own interests. But this makes him flawed, and scared. He sees incomplete visions of a future that he (and we as the player) decides, but ultimate events do not change at all. Beth still dies, Paul Serene still goes mad, and both people he suspects of betraying him do so in some form or another. In this light, the linearity of the map and plot design work in the game's favor to emphasize that these events, these fights and these outcomes cannot be changed, which is what scares Paul Serene into making the Lifeboat Protocol. It's this seeing of events that allows him to do what he's done and make Monark. All in a vain attempt to save the world.

The beauty of it is that, even early on we realize, Paul ISN'T the bad guy. At least not entirely.

Both him and Jack want to save time (literally) in their own ways, and those put them at odds. One wants to save the few people that can work out a solution in a lifeboat so they can work to fix things, which is a long term bet that, aside from projection statistics, has no guarantee of working. The other wants to fight the other and go back in time to stop, or fix, the event from happening. One is guided, the other is misguided. One is focused, the other is reckless. One is blue, the other is red. You get the point.

I like this dynamic because while Jack is headstrong and going by ear as they learn things, Paul is simply sticking to a plan. But in the end, both want to save the world and go to very extreme measures to do this.

Okay story ramblings aside, and yes i am rambling, this game has a beautiful story, simple but interesting gameplay and awesome visuals. Time powers are fun, and as long as you don't try to play like a generic cover shooter, it'll be a ton of fun.

Difficulty of course is nonexistent even on hard. I only died when i was doing stupid stuff like camping too much, staying too far out of cover with takedoowns and the like. The only time i REALLY felt was bullshit was at Monark HQ when you set up the time machine. ""Thank you, you very slow machine lady"". This part basically pits you with swarms of armored and unarmored common enemies, several Chronon Soldats (my own name, definitely fits better than the official Striker term) and some heavy and sniper enemies. This part i was stuck in (which yall probably saw the post on) because i was focusing too hard on one subset of enemies when i SHOULD have grabbed the Carbine early on and perforated the first sniper and blew up the othe one, cuz convenient barrel. So when i finished THAT up i was relieved but disappointed i has trouble.

Got through all of that, saved my bro, and went back to safe causality, yay! But Paul is waiting and ready for a fight. Except i don't get to fight him, i just shoot him twice the a carbine in between rounds of his little Mooks. Hardly qualifying as a boss fight to me and the way people complained made me legitimately worry about this boss fight.

But apparently people were still playing like a cover shooter (big no no) instead of both using your powers and staying on the move. It got to the point i wasn't even clutching the shield as hard to keep myself alive as i was before. The only real danger in this fight is the time stop Paul uses, which is predictable and Joyce even says ""gotta move"" or ""oh no"", as if he was being pelted with a grenade. The fight REALLY emphasized movement and cover moreso than any other fight in the game, because you LITERALLT die if you stand still too long. And that torrent he does? Just go to the opposite end of the map. Simple.

So yeah, kinda underwhelmed on that front. But i liked the game and it's ambiguity. It was fun to play and i may go back for another round later to get the other ""branches"" of the episodic story. (Which i thought was kind of lackluster compared to everything else. It's really only good for some background story and only occasionally starts interacting with the main characters and the protagonist toward the end. This point was hyped up when i looked into the game, but i was frankly not enthralled.)

Quantum Break is a fantastic game, telling a direct story in a very indirect way (if that makes sense) and having characters that are actually BOTH right on opposite ends as protagonist and antagonist but in different ways was really a nice touch. And the fact they wrote it in a way that indicates even at the end that the events loop and never change really interests me, and it adds a plot framework for repeat playthroughs as why things are never actually different when you pick a different outcome. 

I recommend people play this, and i'm going to be waiting for Control to go on sale now so i can go play THAT. I think i really like Remedy.",0
387,gaming,"This might sound a bit odd but I’ve got myself a PS5 and along with it quite a few games (my friend let me use their digital games) but no matter the game I can’t seem to get into it. 

I don’t really know if this encapsulates it but I hate the feeling of been compelled to do something. Go here, talk to this person, watch a cut scene, collect the artefacts. 

And in the games that are too open world it just causes me grief at the thought of exploring all the little side quests and caverns. 

The only games I’ve really gotten into over the last few years are God of War and RDR2. Generally I used to love the dark souls games but haven’t been able to get into them recently, I even got a ps5 for Elden ring but since then haven’t really wanted to buy it. 

I tried 

Far cry: Too much trouble with all the towers and mundane missions 

Hunt Showdown: I love hunting other players but I hate all the zombies and boss fights 

Ghost of Tshuima: only one I enjoyed 

Deathloop: So much trouble to collect all the bits and I just want to invade other players 

Call of duty: I like multiplayer and even the campaign but it’s got so many micro transactions it dries me up the wall. No I don’t want to see your cool dance you paid £16 for. 

I used to love games, maybe I’ve just fallen out of love. I see videos of people playing Elden ring and it’s gets me all excited only for me to find… I don’t seem to enjoy games, but I can’t really put my finger on why. 

I love league of legends and it’s just get it and play, you know what you’re getting and you make what you will of it.

I used to do a lot of PC gaming but the last couple of years I have done almost exclusively console gaming because it's a lot more convenient. Lately I've been wanting to get something next gen (currently using PS4). Ideally I would like to get both a PS5 and Series X, but obviously that's pretty difficult right now. Recently I've been considering the Microsoft all access package as a way to finally make the jump and at least get a series X. However, it's obviously a bit of a big purchase. I like the IDEA of XBGP, as the majority of my gaming currently is fueled by titles I get from PS plus and PS now so I'm used to relying almost exclusively on digital content. I guess I'm just stuck in a cycle of FOMO where I think it would be easier to just get the series X that is at least somewhat readily available but then worrying that if I do that I might miss out on a chance to get a PS5 should I luck out during the next restock which would allow me to continue to play all the games that I currently have access to.

I have been looking for a sub-reddit to help me with this.. I thought this one would be very comfortable and kind to help me with this decision! So, I currently run BootCamp on my Macbook Air (2017 Build) to play some classic/indie/casual games on Steam, and it can run them pretty well! But.. Looking at its specs and my external HDD recently dying when playing games from it, BootCamp is no longer necessary and my Mac had literally no storage for games since I run Adobe and Office programs on it already...

So, my school store was selling an HP Laptop - 15-dw2048nr for $250.00 (original price was $500) and I attempted to do some more research. It's product number is 15-dw2048nr and it includes a 1.2GHz Intel Core i3-1005G1 Dual-Core Processor and with 8GB 2666mHz SDRAM and 1TB of internal HDD storage, along with all of the necessary ports I need for proper charging and good ethernet usage.

Would this HP laptop be a cheap and affordable upgrade from my old 2017 MacBook Air, which has a slower processor and barely any storage on it? I did enough research to determine that it may be better and I would be able to sell my MacBook for profit, but I have no intention on getting a gaming Desktop PC at the moment, and I only intend on switching laptop and continuing to play Steam games on a laptop for now.

To whoever helps me with this, I will greatly enjoy your feedback and further questions you may have for me. I am very stuck with this and I would like to make a firm decision on this by Monday.

474,gaming,"for me a game that I quitted was Amnesia:the dark descent.

when I played it I was expecting some sort of hybrid between the deponia series and the observer.

the observer is a 3d first person horror mystery game with very few puzzles,where you play as a detective trying to solve some murders. and the deponia series are point-and-click adventure games full of puzzles and no horror.

&amp;#x200B;

this game was very boooooooring at the begin and I just gave up.

I am okay with a game having a vague story as long asthe story is either interesting and I have some reason to pay attention to it or so unimportant to the gameplay that I can completely ignore it(like in hollow knight).

the story in this game was kinda boring so after a point I stopped paying attention to it,which caused me to miss a hint on how to solve a puzzle.

489,gaming,"I honestly can't believe how much people ignore both the context of his death and his character arc in the first game. In the first game, Ellie and Joel's bond worked so well because they both changed each other. Ellie became the hardened killer we see in the second game, whereas Joel became softer - no, not so soft to become some pacifist, but more trusting. This is emphasized and highlighted with Bill telling him that Ellie's influence is going to make him more vulnerable, and is then proven with how, despite Henry trying to strangle him and then leaving him for dead later, Ellie convinces him to stick with them. This is the same guy who didn't even blink when executing Robert for betraying him earlier.

So Joel falling asleep next to the guy who tried to strangle him 10 minutes earlier, that's perfectly fine - but Joel preferring to walk into a room with the people who just fought with him and saved his life, after Tommy (the guy who said ""surviving by living like Joel did wasn't worth worth it"", the guy who wanted to pick up that family at the prologue, the guy who literally created a community built on mutual trust) already gave Abby their names, meanwhile they're wearing jackets of a faction that isn't the fireflies and the situation outside is cloudy with a chance of infected while Jackson is too far away - that's character assassination?

Also I don't know how some people think the game can simultaneously hate Joel AND have that museum flashback, that's a paradox if I've ever seen one. If you wanted Joel to face no repercussions for his actions at the end of the first game then you should probably address your complaint to the fact that he lied about them in the first place.",0

Games are expensive nowadays and we all have old/unplayed games sat in our library that we wasted money on. Any DLCs bought would also be added to the value of the game when trading it in.

Edit: I know this isn't exactly lucrative for Sony but it's just an idea I thought of when I was looking at buying the Arkham Collection even though I already own one of the games but don't get a discount for it. Same goes for the Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection.",1

I have fought this for over a week with no results. I’ve tried every thing I can find on the internet and YouTube. All my devices will connect to my extender but my PS4 will not. It will connect to my router that is one room away but not to the extender that is in the same room as my PS4.

595,PS4,"I've had my ps4 for about 6 years now and it hasn't run into any major problems until now. About a year ago I was playing when suddenly the ps4 ejected the disc by itself. I shrug it off as just a weird thing that happened except it kept ejecting discs for no reason. So I watched a video which told me to take the rubber foot off the bottom, which I did. This solved the problem immediately and I thought that was that. However my ps4 also started experiencing another problem which was shutting down randomly. It would beep randomly, and then the ps4 just shut off completely as if someone pulled the plug. I know it isn't overheating because just yesterday I was literally on the home menu not even doing anything when it just shut off randomly. And to make it worse my ps4 is now randomly ejecting discs again. Again, I know it's not overheating because it just does it when I'm not even doing anything, and I clean my ps4 quite regularly sooooo yea.

597,PS4,"I think after years of going the digital route, the physical discs and cases have created this sorta nostalgic feeling to gaming for me. It rekindles this love that I’ve always had as a kid but somewhere along my path of growing up it was suppressed by family and friends. I still played video games but felt weird about expressing how I felt about the story of certain games, their characters and the world created in them. Now for some reason at the age of 30 I have finally gotten over that (maybe subconscious I’m not sure) thought/feeling of, “I shouldn’t love video games that way and stop being lazy” feeling and have fully embraced my love for them.

I’ve expressed this before to a few people and their reply was, “It’s probably because of its now popularity of the gaming community.” Which of course that could definitely be it but maybe because of the now popularity, I now have this feeling like I’m part of a community and I’m not alone in my love for video games on a much bigger scale. I certainly didn’t have that feeling growing up but it’s nice to have it now as I play with random strangers and we strike up a friendship and express together the love we have over the same things. 

This was just a random thought that I had as I was typing this in a reply to another post/comment. So I felt like sharing this epiphany that just occurred with me.

601,PS4,"Casual gamer here (I’ve used Logitech game-pads on the PC). I’ve seen reviews of the controller on PS5.(has been impossible to get one in India). Definitely looks and feels next-gen. But I have some qualms with controller on PS4.

I might be over-scrupulous here, but..

1. It’s plastic-ky and feels poorly built. I hate that there is not much of a heft to it. Doesn’t feel solid in the hands. Sony could have used some higher quality plastic along with rubber grips under-neath and for the sticks.

2. Buttons are mushy. I love how the Macbook trackpad clicks. The buttons could also be pressure sensitive (something like 3D Touch?)

3. R3 and L3 sticks can be made pressure sensitive or adaptive. Like when you are pulling a lever in Uncharted or GOW, the sticks can offer more resistance as you are completing the pull.

4. The touch pad can be put on the back of the controller so that it can accessed by the ring finger?

Coming to the title, I’m a huge Apple fanboy and I wonder what innovation could Apple bring to a game pad?

604,PS4,"**TL;DR** \- RemotePlay helped finally fit the PS4 into my life. Despite some baffling decisions or oversight, the graphical prowess and continued support for the platform is encouraging. If Sony could just do better with it's RemotePlay support, I would be ecstatic.

**Question:** What do you consider to be knockout features?  

\----------------------------------------------------

Being that I'm mostly on the go, I never seem to be able to find the time to actually be in one place long enough to game and make what I feel is significant progress - especially since I'm a fan of JRPGs or games that have RPG elements to them. It's why I've always leaned towards portables such as the 3DS, Vita and the Switch. 

**So why the PS4 now?**

Well, I've been a big fan of the Persona series. I've played Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden multiple times. I've also been able to distract myself when Persona 5 came out and also had some wishful thinking of it appearing on Switch. However, with Persona 5 Royal having been released and Persona 5 Strikers - the sequel to Persona 5 already out. It appears to me that the writing has been on the wall long enough to tell me that the mainline game won't be making an appearance. Especially since the previous entries never did.  

**But what about portability?** 

It didn't occur to me until a few weeks ago what Remote Play was really about, and that is the ability to play on a VITA, smartphone, or tablet on the go - so long as there is a WiFi/data connection. When that became apparent, the other shoe dropped. It was like a watershed moment. It was shortly after that a PS4 had found a new home. 

**What are your thoughts?**

It's been a week since I've owned the PS4. Here's some first impressions.

First the good stuff:

* I can't believe I didn't know about RemotePlay sooner! Being able to access the library on the go is a game-changer
* What a rich library of games! I feel like I'm in a fortunate position where there are so many quality games that have had enough time pass so that they can be bought at a fraction of the original price. In my eyes, that is a bargain. 
* I'm excited to experience the PS4's graphical prowess on the go. Beyond having it work on my phone and tablet, I've gotten it to work on the Chromecast too!
* I'm really happy to see that there are still new titles coming to the platform this year
* Being able to use this as a media center is pretty nifty - though I have yet to dive into it.
* The PSN Store UI is pretty nice

Room for Improvement

* The Settings menu needs a revamp somehow. Perhaps maybe it can learn through my usage of what settings I frequently toggle. (ex: connecting/disconnecting my controller since I use it on the go)
* Why no Bluetooth audio support?
* RemotePlay is amazing - when it works. I live in a major city and take a bus to work. There are several moments where there are just dropped connections. Is this a compression issue or something?
* Can Sony please come up with a compact controller on the go or some kind of more pocket-friendly peripheral? You can't necessarily slide the controller into your pants pocket.",1

I didnt have the recipt bc I'm a dumbass and got rid of it asap so I counted it as a loss and went on with using the drifting controller for a few months, I had little ways of fixing it (turning it upside down and giving the sticks a wiggle, using a pin to clear out debris) and it was useable for the most part. Well yesterday I decided I was sick of the drift and decided to transfer over the battery from the drifty one to the new one in hopes that I could use it again. Long story short it worked, I turned it on, no drift no problems, basically a brand new controller. 5 mins later I took it home (fixed it at my parents bc they have the tools I need) and when I got home the controller didnt turn on. Again. I couldn't plug it in, I couldn't press the reset, nothing worked. Now I have no controllers that work and I'm very frustrated that my ps4 controller is frying all my batteries.

However, a thing about open world games like HZD is that halfway through the game the gameplay becomes boring and exhausting. I don't want to finish HZD and then jump straight into HFW and experinece similar gameplay for another 60 or so hours.

So my question is, should I finish HZD again before leading up to HFW or skip HZD, read the synopsis of the original game, and go into HFW fresh?",1

637,PS4,I’m not sure how to frame this or if it’s ever happened to anyone else. I got a notice on my PlayStation saying that I was permanently banned from the network for violating community rules. I couldn’t log on I was blocked. I found the error code and it regarded chargebacks and the reversal of charges for bundle purchases I’d made. I checked with my financial institution that I used and they said all the payments were processed for the purchases and weren’t charged back. I emailed PlayStation Network and explained this. They send a email basically reiterating that I charged back the purchases and gave me a balance I had to pay. I had to purchase PlayStation store credits from a store and enter the codes. I buy a card for more than the amount owed by $5.00. Later I received an email from them saying the card had insufficient funds to lift the ban and gives me another balance to pay that was $6.00 less than the original balance owed. Next time I buy a $50.00 card submit the code. After about 6 hours or so I received another email explaining the ban had been lifted. So after paying $75.00 on a $50.00 charge the ban was lifted but the strange part is I check my transactions made and only the bundle purchases and the $25.00 card store cash payment are shown in transactions and not the other $50.00 card I purchased. Nor was there any balance for overpayment. Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else on the PlayStation Network?,1

Obviously the key to the game is pull the joystick back and forward in an exact manner. 

Once I was able to get over the morality of the issue, is there some 3D printer gizmo that I can put on my controller to ensure this happened perfectly?  Or even some type of guide like the dudes from the shooting game tape up their screen?  I'd like to pull off a magical round just because.

I don't want to send it to get fixed because i still hope there might be a solution I could find which would fix my issue. 

I've tried everything, blowing inside with liquid oxigen, cd's are literally factory new, (i NEVER touch the bottom part) so no need to clean any, i restored the data, i even reinstalled the PlayStation software as indicated on the webpage, i tried the tapping technique, laying it on EVERY SINGLE side, i even tried to shake it a little while it was trying to read the cd, nothing. 
Nothing helped, does anybody know any other solution which might not involve disassembling the whole console?

After a few months, this thread is now becoming bi-weekly, as a way to make questions less scattered over threads.

As a reminder, the following threads are no longer allowed on [r/PS4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/) and will be removed:

* **Tech Support questions** (""I have a problem"", ""My controller doesn't work"", ""I can't connect to PSN""...)
* **Game recommendation** (""Which game should I get?"", ""Is this game good?"")
* **General questions** (""Where can I get a PS4?"", ""What do you think of this controller?"")

**Those questions now have to be asked in this thread**. It will be renewed at 12:00 PM EST on Mondays and Fridays.

This thread is sorted by **New answers by default**. Sorting it by Top or Best could give answers to commonly answered questions.

please tell me if any one knows way to set for example (actually this is exact my desired scenario) forward stick movement under L3?

You know, like arrows to move but under R3? AND to be more complicated, arrows per se arent responsible for movement, only analog sticks.

PS: i highly dont want to use any strikepack or other hardware modifiers if possible.

Edit: for downvoters - it is not for antirecoil macrose or something everyone hate.
In apex legends tap strafe is a thing on PCs, but impossible to do on regullar controller becouse you need use forward move button midair when redirecting with left stick to side, which is impossible due to how stick works.
People playing on PC with controller uses macros on steam with no shame and hate becouse this is just workaround to use game movement hown you should.",1

The store clerk said they’d not had any shipments of them since mid 2021.

Blows my mind that they’re in shortage seeing as there’s the new console and controller- what, did people give up the ps5 wait and get ps4s??

Hate to rant but I think some of Sonys products are just a waste of money. I’ve paid around 400$ for the console, probably the same amount again for the many controllers that end up unusable after a couple months.. When I say unusable I mean it, it feels like playing with Tourette’s- your camera jerking and sliding everywhere with the slightest touch.

And no, it’s not a dead zone issue.",1
706,PS4,I played BB last year and had fun but I thought it was by far the easiest FS game I have played. With the release of Elden Ring I have spent a lot of time reading online and have been surprised to see many consider it to be the hardest. Can I get some long FS fans perspective on this?,1

I don't want to bore you with any introductions or history of making this list so without further ado, I raise this post to help you know if game you want is worth buying. If you can't stand ""normal controls"", and standard camera control settings for you is inverted X and Y axis, games on this list got this feature. 

I hope that thanks to this list (that you will help me expand) will prevent you from buying game that it's not possible for you to play, cause of our x/y axis invert habbit.

Let's hope that game developers will be mindfull and prepare their games for people like us and such list won't be nessecery.

He's not played any of the souls games before, and I hear DS3 is a good entry from what I've read in various threads and articles.
Are there any other challenging game recommendations that I can suggest and surprise him with?

I just got the Lenovo g27q-20 and I love almost everything about it, (especially color since good color coverage is really important to me -like top priority) except the fact that it seems to be lagging. It’s a 165 hz screen with freesync but I know PS4 can’t do more than 60 and doesn’t support freesync. The new monitor has more lag than my old one did, which sucks but why? Is it because the new monitor can’t keep up at that low hz?
And what do I do? Would I be better off with a monitor that is clocked at 60 and not any higher?

Now I know how ""i"" is interlaced pixels and everything and how 1080p is definitely better but someone who prefers performance over graphics should definitely give it a try.So I am just throwing this option out there.

Games like HZD,AC series,Witcher 3,rdr2...all became smooth at 1080i.

790,PS4,"I was getting a lot of fan noise under heavy load in some games so I took the cover off completely to see if it helped and the fan was quiet. So I cut a hole in the cover and cut up a drink holder I found for about $4 at Walmart to act like a nice finishing touch.

Edit/update:
After reviewing the comments I see that people think the air being drawn across the plastic surfaces inside of the console is additional cooling on the intake side. I have searched articles to see if this is true and I am unable to find any proof that improving the intake amount by allowing the fan to directly intake air is harmful. 

Secondly on the idea that this will increase dust into the inner workings. I have to disagree as there are no filters between the fan and the OEM intake ports. In essence this will improve the ability for me to see that the fan is dusty if it gets dusty at all and clean it. 

Third I have replaced all thermal paste and was doing this mod for a bit of fun and for improved airflow yes it’s quieter now because the fan doesn’t have to work as hard to get colder external air into the intake. If at any point it becomes worse “ I don’t see how” I will replace the cover with an original. 

After reviewing google images for “PS4 Fan mod” I’m pretty surprised you guys are appalled by my mod when there are a ton of even worse things out there. Remember kids, its my console that I own.

One thing that’s been bothering me though is the plant life in HFW. Plainsong should be in Eastern Nevada right? Then why is there a bunch of monstera and other tropical plants? 

I haven’t reached the coast yet but from promo material, I know it’s also tropical in-game which isn’t accurate.

807,PS4,"Huge and beautiful open world which once again feels empty, with bland, unrewarding and unsatisfying sidequests, errands and characters. Locations of interest and dungeons are starting to become repetitive, and as a completionist this is extremely frustrating because I like to check every question mark available. Combat is the same as before with machines being overly aggressive, which makes combat a rolling/concentration fest that in the end becomes repetitive and unsatisfying. Spear combat has improved for sure, but I rarely use it when fighting machines unless I go for critical hits. 

This is one of the reasons I try to avoid combat in Horizon whenever possible. Bandit camps are also suffering from past game’s direction, stealth in this game is never as satisfying as in other games like Arkham Knight or even any Assassin’s Creed. I just don’t see Aloy terrorizing bandits, this is something that always feels wrong with her personality/character. Wish she had some other tools to do stealth combat, like a special dagger she can only use in those circumstances. 

The game is gorgeous and much improved over HZD but I can’t believe I’m having more sense of wonder and general satisfaction in Elden Ring which I think is a much simpler game.

Edit: Sorry for my bad descriptions of combat, I don’t find combat hard at all I just find it annoying/repetitive because I have to resort to the same strategy with every type of machine so far, which is ropecasting, find weakpoints/weaknesses and concentration away.

Edit2: Just completed first cauldron after 16 hours. They haven’t changed anything from HZD on these, same endless climbing and very little reward at the end. Incredibly unsatisfying and tedious.",1

What we have gotten so far, they have cut off ability to use Russian PS store, which affecting us, and let's be honest sanctions are hitting us (Latvia) harder than Russia. 

Support is rejecting our requests to change regions on accounts, so we are technically f\*\*ked over by them. As it seems that their specialists couldn't come up with anything better, like blocking off people by the actual IP geo (as it seems it requires some skills and proper mindset), and they have just suspended whole store based on the region instead. 

I am worried to use their services as well in the future, as now it is Russia and later it may be us or anybody else by that logic.

Chances are you have one too at home somewhere and its atleast worth a try. It didnt work for the screws inside the ps4 to access the motherboard or even the cooling fan grill for example,but the fan itself will be accessable and its enough to clean it alone.And if you have either a ps4 slim or pro, then you really have no excuse not to clean your fan,you can just pop off your console cover, no screwdriver needed. Its soo worth it.

Edit: Read buscanth's comment for further information.

Edit 2: All i did was clean the fan itself, I wasnt able to disassemble the console any further with my screwdriver.

For years now I have ensured that the fan and heat sink were always clear of dust that has always silenced the fan, but recently that stopped making much difference.

So I purchased what I thought was I guess quality thermal paste and took an hour or two to disassemble and apply it, and after reassembly I and stunned at how quiet this thing is now. 

Suffice it to say the old thermal paste was dried up and hard like clay which was likely the root cause of it being loud, but this is even quieter than it was stock if I remember correctly.

Even high demand games like Black ops 3 and Modern Warfare 2019 can barely get the fan to rev up before it quickly quietens it down.

909,PS4,"The Horizon series have simply gone from strength to strength, in my humble opinion.

I absolutely fell in love with the first title when it came out; a truly huge, lush, epic, and beautiful world filled with varied biomes, weather, real world animals, and AMAZING machine animals. 

A high concept apocalyptic science fiction plot / story that I thought succeeded brilliantly. 

Such a unique and cool concept. 

Amazing and varied combat mechanics, allowing one to plan and enjoy combat encounters in a wide variety of ways, even if all you choose to do is batter and stab everything to death with your club. 

Excellently and realistically written characters with superb and emotional voice acting (respect to Ashley Burch and good on her for all the awards she is winning for her portrayal of Aloy, what a talented person, from Tiny Tina to Aloy, what range!).  

Stunning world building packed full of interesting sights to see and amazing lore to peruse through in the form of datapoints.

I don’t want to drop any spoilers for the plot of the second game (I’m about 2/3s of the way through the main story, exploring the whole map and doing side activities right  now), but it adds to and improved upon the story from the first one in many awesome ways. 

I won’t deny, the game IS a bit of a grind collecting money and parts for weapon purchasing and upgrading, but the grind is fun if you want to do it, and the starter weapons can see you through the whole game if you don’t. 

They have greatly reduced the number of traps you can have out now, but I think that’s good for the balance of the game, as they were ridiculously OP in the first one, just being able to lay down a murder field of 20 or more traps. I do miss the whistle, as rocks are NOT as effective in terms of luring enemies.

This game is honestly an absolute treasure, a real gem. Directly before it, I had played, from release, Dying Light 2. It was a good game, with a lovely environment, decent story, cool enemies, and interesting combat mechanics (even if they weren’t up to the level of the first game) but the game was an absolute insane buggy glitchy mess. The first game I have ever straight up abandoned due to glitches. Two separate story mission trophies not popping was the last straw for me. 

So it was an incredible relief going from that hot mess to Horizon Forbidden West, in which I have had ZERO glitches in my 70 plus hours of playtime since release.

Throw on some chill tunes and just get lost in exploring and gathering and fighting (or not!) your way around the incredibly varied map; soaring, icy, mountain peaks, vast, parched, rocky, deserts, swampy, cold, ominous, wetlands, humid, impenetrable, lush, jungles, icy, desolate, snowy, wastes, and the beautiful temperate rainforests and beaches of the west coast (which fill me with such beautiful nostalgia for my childhood summers wandering the beaches of Vancouver Island with my grandparents and other family). It soothes your soul and provides a truly rich and interesting and immersive gaming experience.

As a gamer whose favourite genre is open world, and as a lifelong science fiction fan, this is as good as gaming gets for me, and I am loving every second of it.

From the bottom of my heart, Guerilla Games, thank you so much for this wonderful treasure of a gaming experience!

I have been going through rough times emotionally as of late and this game has been a tremendous salve for my troubled mind and soul!",1
910,PS4,"To preface this I have a CECHYA-0080 headset for the ps3 and upon buying a ps3 earpiece a cechya-0082 dongle was included.

Now my question and hopefully someone can give me some proper insight into this as I might just be over-thinking things but if these headsets work on the 2.4ghz bluetooth band why does the 0082 dongle refuse to pair with the 0080 ps3 headset?

Is it because of the additional custom eq option (off-1-2 switch) found on the ps4 headset? Or is it purely hardware based via Sony?

Will the 0082 dongle work with all the ps4 headsets and the 0081 dongle with all the ps3 headsets?

Would something like one of those Bluetooth 5.0 generic dongles pair with it?",1

956,PS4,"I've been playing Elden Ring on my PS4 Pro, but the load times were killing me. And I'm still bad at the game which means I die &amp; reload a ton.

So I got a solid state drive last night. After hooking it up, I was blown away by how well it worked. YouTube videos say that you can expect about a 30% reduction in load times but for me it was reducing load times by 50%, getting them down to around **10 seconds** on average.

For me, this difference feels enormous. Ten seconds flies by whereas the original load times (20 seconds or more) made me fidgety.

It was also way easier than I expected to set it up as an external drive and transfer the game's files. ([This video](https://youtu.be/ypQTC6Rt0jk?t=366) has instructions. It takes about 10 minutes.) I know you can get an additional boost if you mount the SSD internally, but [when Digital Foundry compared the difference](https://youtu.be/E07IM_bArGQ?t=500) it wasn't as big as I expected.

YMMV if you have a base PS4. Using an external drive should give you a similar boost, I think. But you might actually see smaller gains if you replaced your internal hard drive, because the base PS4 has a different storage standard (SATA2 vs SATA3).

For anyone curious, the drive I'm using is a Samsung 870 QVO 1TB plugged into a UGreen 2.5"" USB 3.1 hard drive enclosure. Together they cost about $130, which is cheaper than a PS5 and a helluva lot easier to find.

I figured I'd share my results in case anyone else is in a similar situation and wondering what the real-world impact of an SSD will be.

TL;DR: Hooking up an external SSD can cut your Elden Ring load times in half and it's crazy easy to set up.",1

966,PS4,"This is ridiculous, that on my PS4 (probably all PS including PS5) I cannot change the region once I set it for my account. I moved from one country to an other and I can't use the main account if I want to buy something because the stores reagion locked. That is understandable, everyone doing it for various legal reasons.  
But not letting people change the reagion of the main account once it's set is just outrageous, while every other platform lets you do that, without any fuss or inconveniance.

Why Sony can't do this? I tell you why. Sony is living in the past and they don't listen to their custommers.   
It is really sad, they really think that people in these days are tied to one place for their whole life and won't move from one country to an other.  
That's not the case Sony! People these days are alowed to meve between countries. Not just alowed, but many of us will.  
There are multiple reasons why people would move from country to country, one is because they have to. Either because of work or other reasons. Or get this Sony, because they can.

After realising I can't change my region that I originally set on my account (which i couldn't beleive) I reached out to Sony through custommer support, to ask what's going on and what's the solution.  
Their solution was: Create a new account which is set to that new country where I moved and use that account.

I was shocked, that this was their answere. They want me to not use my main account where I have my games and friends, trophies and so on, but use a new account just because they are not willing to give us this simple option?! For that I say screw that Sony!

Since I found out that I can use my original ""main account"" still while I buy things on a new account set as the main account.  
This is not a solution, this is an uggly, shitty patch on the underling problem.  
\* First, because I moved to a German speaking country, the ps store (and deper settings menus) are in German that I can't change and my German language skills aren't good as I don't really need it for my work.  
\* Second, If I buy ingame something on this ""shopping account"" that's really just a russian rulette if I can use that content on my original account or not. Recently I bought the season pass for Controll and I'm unable to play that content on my original account.

Oh and if someone have to move from country to country constantly because their job requires them, they just have to create an infinate amount of accounts just to be able to buy games and content?  
This is ridiculous. Basically Sony with their shitty policies basically saying screw you to these people.

This is not just cumbersom to juggle around these accounts, but anoying and many times it doesn't even work as intended.  
I really like the consol itself, I really like the exclusive games or just plaing on the Playstation, but having to deal with this kind of shit, is just frustrating. 

I refuse to beleave that sony such a huge company is not capable of adding a simple feature where you can change your region/location for your account.  
Yes I'm avare that on the PS5 you can switch between stores and in some cases actually buy content, but in many cases it doesn't work and it's not a solution.

I want to have one account where I can choose my location so I can access the store of that country I moved to and buy content there, and not having to deal with the other bullshit, which is the language.  
If I can set the language of the account, I want that language throughout evry single submenu and the PS store.

I'm not asking for free money, these are simple things that should have been implemented years ago.  
It's ridiculous that I want to spend money and I can't even do that.

I really hope Sony will do something about this. Because they will loose customers because their stubborn outdated thinking.",1

A. Play random games depending on your mood with no consideration of completing your backlog.

B. Just focus on your main game until you complete it then move to the next game respectively. 

C. Cycling through games when putting emphasis on your main game but progressing slowly.

I tend to end up in the third option so what are your strategies and thank you in advance for taking your time to participate in this post.",1

Well, of course you have, because everyone have had that oddly specific question, well oh boy do I have news. Finally, we have the answer here at, my head.

It is  745'516'421'408'219, yep that number, that's it.  
So fantastic now you know the answer... but was that all, what was the reason for this  
I did you think of this thing the first time you read it. Well of course it is easy.  
The reason is... The reason is...  
Now you know how many ways you can make pokémon soup while camping in the beautiful  
pokémon world. Don't get me started on the upcoming Gen 9.

Kidding, I've already calculated that.  
Lets say that gen 9 adds 90 new pokémon that becomes 1'319'532'068'443'511 combinations, which is  574'015'647'035'292 new combinations, added in 3years time (gen 8 came late 2019)

So if we say that humans already tasted every soup until now.  
That would mean if we counted with 7.9billion humans on earth.  
Every human would need to eat a different soup no one else had tasted every 21min and 43secs  
to have tested all until in 3years (if gen 10 comes then).

Extra Extra:  
After that we would guess the same +90 it would be 2'222'405'981'561'843  
That is amazingly 902'873'913'118'332 nearly the doubled amount. You would eat like 8 times more often in year 2031. Don't even get started if we had one more extra backpack space.  
898pokémons and 7space  -&gt;   96'384'623'053'491'299  
Also even more exponential.   
I don't even like soup. Okay, I do sometimes.  
How to calculate:   
a = number of pokémons   b = backpack size  
sum\_f(1,a,((b+x-1)!/x!/(b-1)!))

My partner is a massive Pokémon fan, and has been basically his whole life. He is especially attached to Espeon, and has a number of merch items, plushies, etc. One of his favourites was a [pair of mugs](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/429460514453596149/) that were sold by the Pokémon center for valentine's day years ago.

Unfortunately, one of those two mugs has met a terrible fate, and has been destroyed. As luck would have it, it was of course the Espeon one.  He's not completely heartbroken over the loss, so if I can't find one, it isn't the end of the world. But he's definitely upset and I would love to surprise him with a replacement for his favourite mug if I can find one.

They are no longer sold anymore, and were a somewhat limited item to my understanding, so I expect that it will be next to impossible, but you can't succeed if you don't try. I attempted to search for one in the past with little luck, so I am reaching out in the hopes that someone may have a lead I could follow or may have one sitting around that they don't use. We are in Ontario, Canada, if that makes a difference, but I'm searching a broader area than that to improve my chances.

Thanks in advance, even if nothing is found, and I am sorry again if this is the wrong place. I don't normally participate in the Pokémon community, but I wanted to try for him.

A while back u/Noodnood966 started a series where they made a signature move for every Pokémon that didn’t already have a signature move. So with their permission I have chosen to continue their series. The last Pokémon they did was the yamask line(s) so I’ll be following with the Jellicent line

Regal Specter (ghost)

80power 100accuracy 10pp

The user uses its regal power to scare the opponent. The user heals their health by half of the damage done by this move. 

I wanted to make something Tammy for Jellicent as it’s highest stat is SPD and I feel like this move could help it survive longer as well as it is based on its shield Pokédex entry where it says that it siphons organisms life forces.

I’d like to end this by clarifying that I have no competitive prowess. I know squat about what makes a Pokémon good or useful. So if you have any suggestions on how to improve these moves than please let me know.",2

Here are the final results of this long adventure:

[https://imgur.com/a/tqgAAfX](https://imgur.com/a/tqgAAfX)

So... Yeah. I was crazy enough to attempt this challenge and, let me tell you, Gamefreak should have really come up with better ways to make completing the dex enjoyable. Some research tasks were pure boredom/nonsense (both at this point in the game and post-game).

This was the mission before you get to report to captain Cyllene, while you are still a No Star member. 

WARNING: long read ahead. If you're not interested in the details, just skip to the final section.

**The Beginning.**

When you get to the fiedlands you have access to about 30% of the map (from Sandgem Flats to Horshoe Plains).

I spent a GOOD WHILE, trying to complete most entries that I had available to me, trying to spawn 35 Eevees, defeating countless bidoofs to get the move tasks done, farming items to keep crafting pokéballs as I traveled around, etc.

Drifloon/drifblim was a nice pokémon to use, but I never knew it was THAT good of a pokémon until now (even if it's not the same as in the main games). It has access to a variety of strong/useful moves and it is both tanky and a sweeper, so I made sure to always have my ghostly friend in top condition.

**The first problems presented themselves** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/

While dealing with Shinx entry, I realised that I needed a Ground type move to be able to complete its research tasks, but none of the pokémon available in the area were able to learn such moves.

My first thought, obviously, was to catch a geodude, but the ore deposits from the areas nearest to the camp never shaked during this challenge (not sure if it is coded like that or if it was extremely bad luck). So I braced myself and travelled to the far west of the map. And, right where Alpha Snorlax is, an ore deposit was shaking and a graveler leapt at me all furious for breaking its hideout.

Once it was caught and I was all excited to continue my jorney, I sent out my Graveler to bury Shinx in dirt and... it refused to obey. I had forgotten that the obedience level in this game is only up to level 10 at first and my graveler was level 28. 

What to do then? Well, just like in the main entries, if you keep insisting, your pokémon will eventually use the move, but it can take a looooot of tries. It is what it is, I guess. But, how was it possible that my other pokémon kept listening to my commands if they were around level 30 by then?

You see, if you catch a pokémon at level 10 or lower, no matter how much you level them up, they will always listen to you. This was also true for the main entries (I believe?), as only traded pokémon wouldn't listen to you if they where a higher level than your badges let you control.

 These were bittersweet news, as the challenge had extended a lot more now, because some pokémon only appear in the wild at higher levels than 10. At least I noticed that if a pokémon had high friendship, it listened to my commands more frequently (or maybe it was just luck).

Another problem that I encountered was the fact that pokéballs were too weak to catch Alphas/higher level pokémon, so you have to keep weakening them and keep throwing balls until they decided to stay in. 

Hypnosis and Mystical Fire were crucial here, that's why Drifblim was a key pokémon during this challenge (plus immunity to Double-Edge). Alpha Alakazam was particularly troublesome at times, but using a certain cheese strat, it was manageable (I'll get to that later).

**It is taking too long, but who cares, I want more...**

I'm sure you remember that a member of Security Corp is blocking the bridge to access the rest of the map until you become First Star.

However, I was totally convinced that you could cross to the other side, but I realised that what I did in my first playthrough was jumping with Wyrdeer, which wasn't an option here. Rolling won't get you far enough and you won't be able to reach the other side before drowning.

That's when I travelled to the point where both sides get closer (the place where Alpha Floatzel spawns) and let all my pokes out in the water trying to find some glitch that would make me use them as a bridge. And, to my surprise, running on top of Bibarel, who was floating very close to the edge, launched me forward and I managed to get to the other side.

I was so excited again, thinking I had made such a discovery only to see that other people had already used Bibarel bridges before -\_\_- Oh, well. At least I had access to almost every pokémon in the fieldlands now.

**More problems came to greet me** ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/

My team by then was Drifblim, Bibarel, Luxray, Floatzel, Graveler (evolved from a lvl 9 geodude :\^) ) and Leafeon, which let me use almost any type of move I needed. But, while you are able to use fast travel even before the game mentions it, having to travel the whole map on foot, COUNTLESS TIMES, was very painful.

I had to make sure my pokémon were in good health all the time as you can't craft revives until a mission later, so I tried to go back to camp only to restore pp or if I needed to change the time of the day (though I ended up doing this more than I expected).

Some pokémon were nightmarish to get. Golbat was such a PAIN because they don't spawn until your rank is higher, except for an Alpha at the entrance of Oreburrow Tunnel. You have to catch it 20 times at night and you have to defeat it 50 frigging times, 25 with psychic moves and 25 with ice moves (WHICH ONLY ALPHA POKÉMON COULD HAVE AND THEY ARE HIGHER THAN LEVEL 10 x\_\_\_\_x ). 

Munchlax took a while as well, (and when I finally got 10 of them I found 3 of them in a row ¬\_\_¬), and those pesky Pichu/Pikachu too, but they appeared more often for me.

**Can I get there?**

During my first playthrough, I got on top of Oreburrow Tunnel early game thanks to Wyrdeer, but that was not an option now. 

I kept trying a trick that supposedly lets you climb mountains by pressing ZR and quickly cancelling with B, but it didn't work for me. And then I noticed that if you didn't take a full step forwards, you wouldn't slip down and you could reach further on the slope. It doesn't work for straight up walls, as you need to be able to walk on it, so it would only work if there is some kind of slope/edge you can walk on. 

Anyway, that gave me access to some more painful to catch pokémon (Chanseys kept running away and I had to weaken them first  :'( ) but this was a very good spot to farm Thunder and Water Stones.

But if I got on top of the tunnel, how would I not get to Ramanas Island now that I knew how to do it? I spent almost an entire afternoon practising my Bridgebarel skills until I finally reached the island, and since I was doing it where Alpha Lopunny spawns and I managed to get cherrim/cherubi's tasks done at the same time.

I stayed in the island for almost another 4 hours catching/defeating Aipoms, Qwillfish (yes, they spawn near the island) and completing Infernape's tasks. All of this after bringing with me the huge supply of items that I had amassed on my travels, of course.

Giving up on spawning a Monferno on the island to give it food (though right after that it spawned in Deertrack Heights), I left with, unfortunately, more tedious work to do. Evolving 5 Stantlers was exhausting enough, but evolving 5 Qwillfish that wouldn't listen to you was even worse.

**Cheese Strats for the win.**

Most of you probably now this, but if you start a battle by hitting the pokémon's back, their first turn (or 2 turns) will be skipped and you will always go first. I used this strat to weaken Alpha pokémon and get them to red health. Just attack, run away and hit them from the back again (you must be targeted first, though, or they'll heal up).

However, I also realized that if you put a status condition (such as drowsiness) on a pokémon and throw a pokéball, then run away if it doesn't get caught, when you reenter the battle, the status condition will still be there. 

Thus, for fast pokémon like Alpha Alakazam, it was in my best interest to make them sleepy first and throw a ball, then proceed to weaken them next. If I did that the other way around, Alakazam destroyed my pokémon and I had to go back to camp and again all the way to the far end of the map.

**Let's close this chapter already.**

To sum up this ""challenge"", I spent 127hours to complete virtually every task that can be completed up to that point (you can't complete the ones requiring you to defeat an enemy that doesn't spawn there, catching some sleeping pokémon was impossible, etc).

I gave up trying to evolve Happininy because you need oval stones and Chanseys wouldn't deem me worth enough to drop them, even after catching 15 and defeating 50 of them :'( (and when I went back on the next mission they dropped one first try T\_\_T).

Also, using Hurricane 70 times with such bad accuracy and with a grumpy unobedient Gyarados was a big NO for me, so I used it just 3 times instead. Btw, you can defeat them early by climbing the mountains next to Alpha Luxio and dropping next to Lake Verity in a certain spot.

And I believe that was it. I reported back to the professor, and there were my results:

I caught more than a thousand pokémon but the counter stopped at 999,  58 different pokémon (evolutions doesn't count), 53 for the first time ( would be 55 with bidoof/starly/shinx, so I'm two off and I really don't know why?), 514 back strikes and 71 alphas.

For that I was awarded the trifling sum of 38.460 rank points and reported my progress to Captain Cyllene, who advanced me to 9th Star from just one expedition. After this? I don't want to hear about pokémon ever again... Who am I kidding? Can't say no to my pretty boy beldum.

If you made it till the end of the post, congrats! I contributed to waste a bit of your time just like this challenge wasted mine. I may end up doing a video documenting the whole thing, as I recorded some clips and there is some other stuff that I'd love to show as well, but, until then, stay safe and thank you!",2

1136,pokemon,"So here's my opinion about the stories  of pokemon games.

  


People value the story of a game way higher than they should, the story is just 20 minutes of fighting grunts and 3 minute cutscenes every 4 hours of your playthrough and you value that more than the postgame.

I can see why you would value it more but I think the stories are just repetitive and its something that's just there and you forget about it and remember it on the remaster of the game.

I don't think all of the stories are bad I just think that most of them are just bland in comparison to the creative stories like Sun &amp; Moon or Black &amp; White 1 &amp; 2 or PLA which is my favorite from them I think those stories introduce the legendry's of the game in a cool and new way unlike most of the stories where its just the same way and you are more excited to see the design of the new legendary than see the whole story, and even they still have a lot of repetitive battles (except PLA).  
 People hate the game way more just because it has less story when most people finish the story in like the first 3 days they get the game and then go on to the postgame and then say that it doesn't feel like old games which I understand but some games just want to stand out.

 xy didn't focus on the story that much because the developer's put on more effort in the gts and the online battles and people where mad back then but look how that has become.

I know this is probably very controversial but I think the postgame is better than the story and i just don't know why so many people buy the game and be so focused on the story part of it.",2

1188,pokemon,"Has this question already been answered by the anime (I've only watched the first season with Ash, Misty and Brock in the Kanto Region and that was years ago)? Meowth (Team Rocket), Mewtwo and Pikachu are the only ones I can remember who've talked but Meowth (Team Rocket) is more of a member of Team Rocket than he is a pokemon sent out for battling, Mewtwo has no trainer, and Pikachu doesn't refer to Ash in anyway if I remember correctly.

I would imagine they would call their trainers ""trainer"" but that sounds emotionally distant, as if pokemon and trainers are simply co-workers which would go against one of the core messages of Pokemon where pokemon are friends.

They might refer to their trainers using the actual name of their trainers, which makes the most sense.

Certain... works of fans have pokemon call their trainers ""master"". You know exactly what I'm referring to. If those works did not exist it might still make sense in a way because they do everything their trainer tells them to do without question unless they don't have the proper gym badge or the story makes them not listen to their trainer. However, imagining the Pokemon world where the pokemon call their trainers ""master"" feels weird.

Gen 5 didn’t get a lot of love upon release so idk if Game Freak would even want to remake them because of that.

Then you also just have the trend of remaking the games every other generation at this point. 

Although I feel like Gen 5 is in an awkward position where it’s the only generation that has sequels to the originals. So would they remake B/W one generation and then in alter generation remake B2/W2? Or would they remake both of them during the same generation just releasing on different years?

Then Gen 6 just felt incomplete, part of that is due to not having a Pokémon Z game which resulted in Zygarde just being shoved into Gen 7.

I decided to make a living dex in Pokémon home, but I was wondering if there were any unwritten rules for making one. For example, all Pokémon must be from from an OT you have. Another one being, Pokémon must come from their original game.

Now I can understand the OT part, but the second one seems a bit excessive. However, now I’m considering catching Pokémon from their OG games in order to be a “completionist,” but I don’t want to because I just want one of every Pokémon. Who is even gonna check where they came from. The most far back I can go is using my 3ds to play retro games and the newer 3ds games. I looked up at the process and they say it’ll take $1,000…

I get that they decided to do Journeys as a way to introduce the story for new viewers and revisit old plots and characters, but they could do that between Alola and Galar, and let Galar have its spotlight!

Galar is the only region that didn't get a full anime gen for itself, so it feels like the writing team had everything planned for it but had to smash it in a 5 part special instead of a full season at least.

That's why characters got really self-explanotory some times like Professor Magnólia out of nowhere talking about Rossi's villaines, and Rossi out of nowhere explaining his background story as if he is was Heinz Doofenshmirtz!!!

A crazy villain like Rossi is interesting if developed correctly and the whole thing about the ""2 kings a sword and a shield"" that were actually the legendaries would be cool stories with a lot mistery if they treated similar to how they treated Alola's misteries like Lily's fear.",2

In the old games you pick your starter and head off into the world to make your name. The story progressed in each town you visited and you were never really tied to home. In fact you're almost always far from home and it feels like a big adventure. In Arceus you're basically immediately drafted into the town militia and have to do missions for them. I spend enough of my real life hours working for a boss that being bossed around in a game just feels very unfun to me. Like I really want to punch that snarky dude that checks my rank points in his dumb face but I can't.

1206,pokemon,"Hello! Do you think Timer Balls are woefully underused? Do you like fossils? Do you think Fossil Pokémon look good in Timer Balls? Then here's some guidance on an esoteric and highly specific Breeding chain relevant to that.

In Gen V, the Dream World granted more than merely a taste of the fleeting nature of online services, as it also granted access to a wide variety of Pokémon with their Hidden Abilities. Normally, when we think of these Dream World-granted monsters, we think they all come in Dream Balls. Meaning that, barring the Gen VII+ exclusive Ball Swap (better name pending) Breeding Mechanic, it would have been impossible to get an HA Pre-Gen VIII Fossil Pokémon in a Timer Ball. **This is not true.**

In fact, the descendents of these dream-descended 'Mons can be in **any** Ball Type that Gen V could muster. That includes Timer Balls. This is because, while a single Dream Ball was provided whenever a Mon was to be retrieved from the Dream World, Trainers were free to use any Ball they had on hand when they actually encountered the Pokémon to ""catch"" it, not just the Dream Ball.

Now, as we know, Ball Inheritance did not become a thing until Gen VI. However, as there are no Ribbons in Gen V, an egg-born Mon from Gen VI can have the exact same Ribbon Potential as its parents.

In short, you can (in theory) have a Shiny, Contest-Winning, Hidden Ability, Timer Ball Kabutops/Omastar/Aerodactyl/Cranidos/Bastiodon/Cradily/Armaldo/Carracosta with impressive birth stats, breeding-specified nature, and Ribbons originating from as early as Gen VI. (Archeops, Tyrantrum, and Aurorus in Timer Balls are not available until Gen VIII in SwSh because they weren't in the Dream World and could not be caught before Gen VIII, only revived in stock Poké Balls.)

(I wrote this to help people who might be looking for highly specific scenarios such as this. Hope it helps.)

1209,pokemon,"Pokemon Generation 1 was released in 1996 then generation 2 was released in 1999 which was 3 years later then Generation 3 was in 2002 which was also 3 years later. Then Generation 4 was released in 2006 which was actually 4 years later with generation 5 being in 2010 which was also 4 years later. Then when Generation 6 was released 3 years later in 2013 Pokemon went back to its original routine releasing Generations every 3 years again. If they stuck with the 4-year routine Pokemon would have turned out like this:

Gen 6: 2014
Gen 7: 2018 (which probably would have ended up making Sun and Moon for the Switch)
Gen 8: 2022

We got Legends Arceus, which I get why people dig it. They're multiple very good things about it but it still just looks unfinished. Like they didn't polish anything. 

Between SWSH's wild area, BDSP's chibi art style, Legends' empty environments and hell, even the animation quality of the new Generation 9 games (more big, empty environments with PS2 graphics) compared to literally anything else coming out the last couple of years, I don't get what's going on at Game Freak.

Aren't they one of the richest game developers in the world?

Do they not upgrade quality and attention to detail because people will buy their games anyway?

Just something that came to mind.

Due to how comments work, if I simply asked “what’s your favourite generation and why?”, some generations would have far more comments at the top than others and people might have to dig deep for even one comment about a less talked about generation. 

I thought this was kind of unfair, so I thought this might be a better way to get some actual information about why people like certain gens: Just ask specifically about why people love 1 particular gen every couple of days and see what info we get out of it.

Starting with Gen 1. If Gen 1 is your favourite generation, why is your favourite generation?",2
1218,pokemon,"

I want the fight animations to change, I love the spectacle of Dynamax Pokémon, it was so cool, however I think they can do more with it. The animations to me always feel so goofy or underwhelming, and there's a few minor things that bug me such as there not being an animation for a Pokémon dodging an attack, etc. I want the Pokémon battles to be more immersive, maybe by added animations or some mechanic changes. I love PVP, but it's a bit boring to watch sometimes. 

Some ideas:

1) New animations for each of the statuses and animations for dodges/misses. Keep you on the edge of your seat! 

2) New animations for each weather and the introduction of the weather. For example if a Pokémon has Drizzle, it should have an animation where the A) The Pokémon could actually summon the rain or B) A camera pan to the sky and violent rain starts epicly. Not just a slight tonal change in the background. 

3) I don't like how the screens don't stay visible, it would be epic if when a Pokémon uses protect, it actually moves into a protective stance, or when someone uses Light Screen, it's visible. 

4) Poses and facial expressions. Cinderace kind of poses as well as a few others, but most Pokémon just stand there, not even in a stance looking like it wants to battle. I think it'd be really cool if Pokémon had a somewhat personality pose, or some movement, like just an example, Luxray could pace back and forth as if it were stalking it's prey, then jump into a battle stance, strike and maybe grin if it doesn't miss or if it's a critical etc. It would just be cool but a lot of work. 

5) I like how the camera changes so you can see different angles, I don't understand the Dynamax battles though... You stand in front of your Dynamaxed Pokémon, then it uses Max Steelspike and kills you as well as the other Pokémon. Not a huge deal, just bugs me. 

6) I love the Trainer Poses, Pokéball choices etc. Customisation is always a good thing, let us choose our Poses when we fight! I love making aesthetic teams, my own gyms etc. It'd be epic to have more customisation. 

7) Can't argue with the music in Sw/Sh... It's so hype, that alone pumps me up and makes me want to fight for hours. Please keep going and release even more bangers! It's so good! 

8) I'm not sure if this is a feature but I would love a 2v2 where it's 4 players who bring 3 Pokémon each, like a regular doubles but in a team instead. It would promote people playing with friends and wanting to buy Switch Online (I don't have it). Plus, even if people do not have friends IRL to play with, it'd be hella cool to see people try work their Pokémon around some other random person's. Would make PVP very interesting!

What do you guys think? Maybe this is too much, but I think it'd make the future of Pokémon games enjoyable. A lot of people were disappointed with Sw/Sh, so, wanted to bring some ideas. :)",2

I need an explenation for Clamperl. Clamperl is really forgettable so i read its Pokedex entries and this thing is confusing me. What is its body?? The shell? The Pearl? The blue stuff under the pearl??  


""Clamperl's sturdy shell is not only good for protection - it is also used for clamping and catching prey. A fully grown Clamperl's shell will be scored with nicks and scratches all over.""

""It makes a single pearl during its lifetime. The pearl is said to amplify psychic power.""

edit: I added some explanations because many people didn't understand many of them, I also removed some or added that some are invalid due to what I read in the comments

**Gen 1**

Bulbasaur : grass (I prefer the first stage of a starter to be monotype,evolutions stay grass/poison)

Charizard : fire/dragon (it's a dragon)

Blastoise : water/steel (it's cannons look like they're made out of steel)

Butterfree : bug/psychic (it knows multiple psychic moves)

Ninetales : fire/psychic (it's said to have some type of magic powers)

Oddish : grass (it's just grass)

Parasect : grass/ghost (the plant took over, the insect is dead, other ghost type in Kanto)

Golduck : water/psychic (it's said to have psychic powers)

Geodude : rock (it's just a rock)

Graveler : rock (it's just a big rock)

Farfetch’d : fighting/flying (galar form exists, but it should have been from beginning)

Doduo : ground/flying (bird that stays on the ground)

Dodrio : ground/flying (bird that stays on the ground)

Hypno : psychic/dark (it's kinda evil)

Exeggcute : grass (giving the psychic type only to exeggcutor makes evolving it more rewarding)

Marowak : ground/fighting (it could fight with the bone)

Magikarp : water/normal (known for being very common, also nerf for gyarados change)

Gyarados : water/dragon (it's inspiration is a carp becoming a dragon)

Mega-Gyarados : water/dragon (same as gyarados)

Dratini : dragon/water (it's aquatic)

Dragonair :dragon/water (it's aquatic)

pikachu is my FAVORITE pokémon, but my best friend who is super into the game says lgp was kinda boring. but i do kind of want the lighter-hearted, classic pokémon experience (think xy/oras for me bc that’s what i grew up with), and i’d assume lgp is closer to that kind of vibe. but then again, i’ve heard legends arceus is AMAZING. so, which should i get? please no spoilers, i’m trying to go in blind!",2

1258,pokemon,"As the title says do you use pokemon like Moltres, Raikou and Regirock during a playthrough of a game? And if so why? And if not why not?

I ask this because these pokemon are in a unique position. They are legendary pokemon but they tend to have a BST of 580 (both Glalie and Lopunny have this same BST) so I feel they fall into a grey area of being powerful but not as powerful as box legendaries, mythicals or pseudo legendaries.

Edit: just to make this clear I'm NOT talking about box legendaries like Groudon or Reshiram, just the ""lesser"" legendaries you'll find during your play through that all have a BST of 580. And yes I am now aware of Glalie and Lopunny having that BST after mega evolution but my point was that these lesser legendaries aren't THAT much more powerful than some regular Pokémon.",2

1260,pokemon,"While i am working on my Siberian region, i made a mechanic that is literally moves that have double typing and new abilities. Let me explain.
Some moves have one type, but certain TMs can have double typing, which does double type damage to certain pokemon and can do a massive amount of danage to a pokemon with weakness to two types of an ability. TM's full potential can be revealed by a certain NPC, full potential of TM is able to give a move another typing and a possibly new ability. Let me use some moves as examples: Scald is a Water/Fire move that is not only able to burn the target, but also this move can hurt enemies with Dry Skin and different Water obsorbing abilities. X-Scissor is a Bug/Steel type move, that can now cause bleed damage, making them slowly lose medium amount of hp, until pokemon stops bleeding out.

To make it more balanced, pokemon will be able to only use either only 1 or 2 double type TMs, because information on imoroved TM is too difficult for a pokemon to understand, so they can only remember one or two moves. But they can forget the double type move and replace it with a normal one or another double type move.",2

This ROM hack was fantastic. It has a ridiculous amount of content and features, including over 800 Pokemon, Mega Evolutions, raid dens with Dynamax Pokemon, a brand new region, an interesting storyline, level scaling for Gym leaders, the ability to view base stats, IV and EVs, in-game mining for items like in the Sinnoh Underground, and a huge list of sidequests to complete.

It also has 4 difficulty modes, ranging from 'Vanilla' to 'Insane'. There are so many options for players and the game is enjoyable as both a casual and hardcore experience.

1272,pokemon,"I've been wanting to play Pokemon B2 and W2 for a while now, but I can only find the romhacks. I just want to know if these games are worth playing, or if they're too different from the original releases.

1273,pokemon,"It just makes sense to me:
At this point Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have been released almost 6 months ago. Legends Arceus has been released for over two months. Only few people who plan on buying these games, haven't yet and most of those people aren't waiting on Home compatability before purchasing.

There's no incentive anymore for GameFreak to update Pokemon Home for these games. But there will be incentive to update Home for Scarlet and Violet, seen as those are mainline games and GameFreak wants these games to sell really well and will try to move the competitive pokemon scene over to these games. 

So my guess is that Pokemon Home will be updated to be compatible with BDSP, PLA and SV all at once. This will probably happen in the last quarter of 2022. So the promise to make BDSP and PLA compatible with Home in 2022 will be respected.

What do you guys think?",2

1275,pokemon,"It's no secret that Z-Moves and even moreso Dyna/Gigantamax were highly controversial additions. But I think the underlying ideas aren't bad and they could've been great if properly implemented.

The way Z-Moves worked out they were essentially a once per game ""delete Pokémon"" button. Crawdaunt not hitting hard enough? Throw on a Waterium Z and watch Crabhammer oneshot most things.    
The way Dyna- and Gigantamax are right now is they're a horribly effective combination of becoming extremely tanky (1.5 - 2x as much HP) and free access to great supporting moves while still keeping the pressure. Just putting Bounce on Gyarados lets you use Max Airstream for 130 power for three turns, each of which raises the speed of (both) your active Pokémon.

Ideally Z-Moves would be worthwhile and strong enough to warrant using an item over without being too unfair to the opponent, and Dyna/Gigamax would be balanced enough so that it's worth using, but doesn't completely dominate the battle.

My concept: give Z-Moves the gimmick of Max Moves, in that they are strong moves that give access to useful side-effects.    
 In Gen7 Supersonic Skystrike (Hurricane) is a 185 power special move with no side effect, only being usable once per battle. Max Airstream (Hurricane) is a 140 power special move that raises speed of the user (and its ally) by one stage, but is usable up to three turns in a row. I would further suggest to cap the power at roughly 130 power. This is about what you can expect from a random coverage move, but instead of the usual downside that those moves have (-2 Sp.Atk, horrible accuracy, etc) the moves come with upside.    
So my theoretical new Flying Z-Move would be 130 power, single-use and raises the user's speed (and that of allies) by one stage.    
Now for Dynamax, I would reduce the moves to be regular, decent moves without side-effects. All status moves still become Max Guard, but all offensive moves become 85 power, 100 accuracy moves. Dynamax becomes a purely defensive tool, allowing to keep up overall pressure and enabling things like Weakness Policy, but having to sacrifice offensive pressure in turn. I think 2x HP boost might still be too much even after these changes, so possibly turn that turn to 1.75x as well.     
Finally for these two, make Dynamax and Z-Moves compete for the same slot. You cannot Dynamax a Pokémon if you already used a Z-Move this battle, or vice-versa.

Here's the one where it get's a bit weird: Gigantamax. Right now it's just a reskin of Dynamax, but with the (in my opinion) great designs they put into the Gigantamax forms themselves I would rather have it be something more akin to a limited mega evolution. Just using Gigamax as it is would be too strong (as NationalDex on Showdown showed). First of I'd make it a copy of my new Dynamax system - HP boost is limited to 1.75x and all moves are 85 power with no secondary effects. Then, because the whole point of Gigantamax is to use G-Max Moves: give the Pokémon back the secondary effects of their Gigantamax moves, but only for their primary typing. (I know, not all G-Max Moves share the user's primary typing, but hear me out). Finally, give the user back the power of Max moves for their secondary typing only - capped at 130 like for Dynamax.    
In essence, GMAX-Corviknight (Flying/Steel) gets the secondary effect of its GMAX Move on its Flying type attacks (with 75 power) and can use Steel type MAX moves with up to 130 power. A GMAX-Skarmory (if that existed) would get the secondary effect of its GMAX Move on its Steel type attacks (with 75 power) and can use Flying type MAX moves with up to 130 power. A single-type GMAX-Pokémon, like Blastoise, would get both the secondary effect and power boost to its GMAX Move, making it much stronger but also more predictable.     
Just like Z-Moves and Dynamax competing, Gigantamax would compete with Mega evolution - you can bring one or the other. You probably also shouldn't be able to bring both Gigantamax and Dynamax. So you can bring either Z-Move plus Mega, Z-Move plus Gigantamax, or Dynamax plus Mega.

Finally, about Protect and Max Guard (and a possible Z-Protect). Z-Moves right now go partially through protect and activate their secondary effect, as do MAX and GMAX moves. I would suggest that both Z and GMAX moves can go through for 25% damage and activate their secondary effects, but regular MAX moves cannot (since now they're just regular moves limited to Dynamax). Max Guard and a new Z-Protect should fully protect against not only Z and GMAX attacks, but also against abilities like Unseen Fist and Moves like Hyperspace Hole.

Now, will any of this happen? No, obviously not. Gamefreak has a record of abandoning even working features and there's little chance they'll reintroduce a feature, especially if it needs fixing. This is just fun theorycrafting to see how these gimmicks could potentially coexist without players being essentially forced to use any one of these.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Make Z Moves the strong attacks with side effects, make MAX moves vanilla moves with average power and make GMAX moves strong or supporting based on primary and/or secondary typing. Limit Z Move/Mega/Dynamax/Gigamax so you have to think about which to bring.",2

We saw megas arrive in Mystery Dungeon DX, we saw them return?! They still have a place in TCG. They are still circulated and they are still so popular with fans, why have they been completely removed?

The only other companion who hasnt had a recent comeback is may, but it is somewhat understandable as her voice actress IIRC has retired.

Atleast cilan, hell even tracy had a cameo as of now despite not coming back.

To be honest i dont know if they just want to leave her exiled, or cooking something major for her reunion with ash considering their you know...more than just friendship status.

What every mainline release so far, there's always a return of returnee Starters across 3 generations to re-star along side the newest Starters. From the looks of things, we're most likely to see gen 8's Starters make a returnee since its always been the trend as the last most recent poster Starters, potentially leaving us with only 2 other generations of Starters left to return. 

I'm seriously hoping we see gen 5's Starters make a return since I would love to utilize Emboar. I never got to use any of gen 5's Starters and I'm amped to finally be able to run multiple sets for the fire pig.

1288,pokemon,"So you'll either need to google a picture of Bronzong or be able to really accurately picture it in your head for this to make sense. So my first Pokemon was Yellow, about 10 years late, when I was around 5/6 in circa 2010. But my second was Platinum, and it's probably my most played Pokemon game to date, because my brother chucked my Gameboy out a window when I was around 7 or 8 so I was stuck with my DS. And as you likely know, Bronzong and Bronzor are incredibly common in that game. However, when I was a kid, I always viewed it ""wrong."" I saw the red circles as its cheeks, and the dark grey patches at the top as its eyes. A friend of mine described this view as a ""grandma,"" which I think is fitting. It was only until I got back into Pokemon at 16, where I super hardcore hyperfixated (I have ADHD) on the franchise when I realized what it was actually meant to be viewed as, where the red is the eyes and the dark grey parts are just designs. But for the life of me, I still view Bronzong in the grandma way, and to be honest, I'm ok with that; it's kind of nostalgic",2

There are multiple ways to practise MTG alone and one of them s Challenge Decks.

https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Challenge_Deck

Which you basically play against with rules for solitaire play. As n these decks are designed for a lone person and using them in actual 
competition, even friendly games against acquaintances, is almost impossible esp if you seek to win games with them.

I never heard of these at all in YGO, Digimon, and Pokemon so  have to ask if the exist? Considering Yu Gi Oh is the most popular CCG in the world and Pokemon is in the same league with YGO and Magic as the Big 3s of TCGs,  find it impossible this doesn't exist for those games.

1301,pokemon,"So I just watched Nick Robinson's video, the one where he recovered a lost Blastoise from a copy of Pokemon Leafgreen. It got me thinking about my own partner. One I lost many years ago.

I used to have a Feraligatr, it was the Pokemon I cherished the most. His name was Crox, and I loved him dearly. He was a Totodile I got in SoulSilver, and he travelled over to Unova with me. Sadly, the Pokemon Black copy he was on, was completely and utterly destroyed after sadly, one of my cousins decided to attempt to snap the cartridge after he got mad at me. He ended up bending it badly to the point I couldn't use it and my mum threw it out. I was distraught, as I wanted to bring him into the 6th generation which was rapidly approaching at the time. Obviously, that cartridge is long gone, but I still have hope. Or so I thought.

I uploaded Crox to a site called [Pokecheck.org](https://Pokecheck.org) back in 2011/2012. However, that site has since shut down. I know that site held .pkm file downloads for Pokemon, and I was praying I could access my Feraligatr's information, download the file and import him into one of my games. However, sadly, Pokecheck appears to have shut down around or before 2017. This means that all my chances of downloading him died 5 or so years ago. 

I tried the wayback machine, but the search obviously won't work, so it isn't very helpful sadly. Were the Pokemon from Pokecheck ever archived? Or did they sadly die with the site. If it helps, I've kept the same favourites since 2009, and one Pokecheck URL is still favourited in there, the pkmn file pk=841561, which I can't guarantee is him, but it's at least the only lead I've got.

Is there any hope of reclaiming that lost partner of mine? Even just getting access to the page he was on so I can see his stats would be enough for me to effectively recreate him in PKHeX.",2

With this thought I came up of a few ideas they might do and some are as straight forward as the poll says. The main 2 I’ll go briefly over will be elements of B2/W2 and post game

My idea with this would be taking ideas from B2/W2 and putting it B/W. The relic tunnel, PWT will all be available but will have the B/W story. Might have ghestsis already have kyruem for his final battle after N to set up a post game with the fusion kyruem. Many places would have post game like the reversal mountain and pokestar studios. 

I’m no game maker so these ideas are terrible explained but it’s just to give gears turning and if you have better ideas please let me know. This is just something I thought about while driving To school.

I'm here because I was recently inspired by Nick Robinson's recent video where he helped someone recover their Blastoise in their LeafGreen save file after his file was corrupted over 15 years ago. This is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqgmR1Hqvbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqgmR1Hqvbk)

In the video, the people involved talked about how each person has a ""Pokemon tragedy"", where someone's beloved save file or Pokemon was lost. For my case, this is my Pokemon Y cartridge. I played that game for well over 300 hours and is the first game I completed the national Pokedex in. I lost it in 2016 shortly before Sun and Moon came out; fortunately, I had just finished transferring the last of the Pokemon I needed into Bank for my living dex. Unfortunately, my team I had used to beat the game was still on the cartridge. I lost the cartridge at my high school, and never found it no matter how hard I looked. 

I was wondering if there was even a tiny chance someone happened to find the cartridge (likely after someone found/stole it and then sold it) and still has it could see this post. I don't want to reveal much about my location, but I lived in central Kentucky at the time. Other information includes:

Trainer ID: 64543  
Trainer Name: Oliver  
Team Members: Delphox (Firefox), Venusaur (Rex), Aegislash (SkywardSword), Yveltal (Y Destroyer)

1312,pokemon,"For me, I would pick strength sap. Its ability to completely nullify physical attackers and heal the user all the way back to full is the most infuriating to go up against in my opinion. Thankfully it is quite rare, with only Cursola, Polteageist, Shiinotic, Drifblim, Jellicent, Vileplume, and Bellossom having the ability to learn it (some of the prevolutions of those mons do get it as well). A couple of those mons are really bulky as it is, and do not need a free heal all the way back to full plus an attack drop.

My prediction is that spore and any evasion move will be common picks, but I'm curious what everyone hates the most.

&gt;!My best guesses as to why are that I didn’t really care about the characters in the galaxy team that much (I liked Cylenne and Akari but the professor was annoying me by this point and I didn’t really care that much for Kamado in the first place), it didn’t really change that much gameplay wise aside from where my main base was (maybe taking away my Pokemon (either the riding or the Pokemon I had on me would have worked? IDK) and aside from a couple of moments (got annoyed when the girl I helped with the bidoof problem said I couldn’t be trusted and I got a little smile from that shinx and luxio scene in the obsidian fieldlands), I didn’t really feel that much throughout the whole thing!&lt;.

&gt;!IDK, maybe I’m just older and moments like this get me more annoyed than sad now. Also probably because this thing never really sticks in games (seriously is there any game where you are banished from somewhere that you won’t go back to sooner or later? Not many come to mind for me.) What do the rest of you think?!&lt;",2

1332,pokemon,"So after playing PLA and BD I've remembered one of the biggest gripes I've had with pokemon for awhile, the repeatedly keep the same 6 pokemon in just about every zone to the point I'm sick of seeing them. When I first reached Mt. Coronet in PLA the first 4 different pokemon I saw where in all 3 of the other areas. I have 6 badges in BD and when I walk in the grass I don't get just the evolutions of those same 6, but occasionally 1 of the 6. In the underground it's almost a carbon copy of those 6 plus the occasional rare to make it seem different. 

I get that they are set in a region and they are supposed to have set pokemon but come on. I don't need to see them in every patch of grass in every spot on the map. It makes the world feel very small when I cross the map to find wait for it... the same pokemon. And don't even get me started on why half of the 6 are IN THE SAFARI ZONE!!!!!",2
1333,pokemon,"For example, a Pokémon that is Fire/Fire-type. It would take 4x damage from its weaknesses, take 0.25x damage from its resistances and deal between 2x and 2.25x damage with STAB Fire-type moves. Personally I don’t want it for two reasons: I imagine it would be overpowered if implemented, especially types with a lot of resistances like Steel or not many types that resist its moves like Ghost, plus it would be hard to make it make sense within the world itself. However, I feel the concept itself is somewhat interesting. Perhaps it could be a future gimmick like Mega Evolution where you can make it so one Pokémon has their primary type in their secondary type’s slot, with any secondary type they used to have being temporarily replaced. Again though, probably still overpowered.",2
1334,pokemon,"Two of my favourite side games of all time are Red Mystery Dungeon for the GBA, and Pokémon Colosseum for the GameCube (the first one; not Gale of Darkness.)

1336,pokemon,"So a lot of People seem to be mad about humanoid Pokemon like Incineroar and Emboar and while I see why I just don't really care. I think it might have something to do with my favourite Pokemon all being somewhat humanoid.

4. Seviper
5. Tapu Lele

8. Lapras
9. Togekiss

I'm here to say that while I don't want Sprigatito or any of the new starters to stand, I wouldn't be that mad if they do stand as some of them could look really cool or cute.

1340,pokemon,"I know it sounds stupid because they are just pixelated animals on a screen but one of the Pokémon that I have grown attached to was my mightyena in alpha sapphire.

Then I found out that she had the pokerus. I also grew attached to my milotic, who I named Marsha. What about you guys? Also which Pokémon did you get attached to other than your starters?",2
1341,pokemon,"There is a lots of opportunity there since the core mechanic of Pokemon is pretty easy to adapt to other game play. And I always find the spin-off more refreshing than just normal game. Like Pokemon Dungeon for example, great mix of rouge dungeon and turn base action game with fun story. Or Pokemon Conquest, one of the best SRPG on NDS at its time. Even Pokken Tournament is much better than most Pokemon stuff we have there day. 

I believe there is more potential for even more Pokemon game out there. Like action Pokemon game like Fire Emblem Warrior and Hyrule Warrior series. Or fantasy setting Pokemon game like Fire Emblem. Or platform Pokemon game like Kirby and Metroid. Or turn-base shooter like Mario x Rabbid. The possibility is endless if GF stop making more puzzle Pokemon game for Candy Crush mom.",2

1347,pokemon,"For me it was when I was playing fire red. I mean, seriously it was ages since I had played that game. When I originally played the game I didn't think much of organized teams(using pokemons that I liked). This time I was determined to make a good team. So I went about listing all the mons available in the gen 3 kanto games and I decided the perfect team for myself. I had gotten far when I realized that starmie wasn't available in fire red. I was soo upset. I had really looked forward to playing starmie. I had to get the leafgreen and catch a starmie and trade it to fire red. But it wasn't completely a waste because While I got leafgreen I decided to ditch doduo and trade a Charizard too to my fire red as doduo is just flying and Charizard is fire/flying. I have to say that was one of my best teams. Nidoking, venusaur, starmie, Charizard, snorlax and jolteon. Infact starmie went on to become my MVP. It was so nice having huge coverage. I defeated almost all of the E4 with it. Starmie was defeated by blue's exeggcutor. I had only venusaur that was not fainted and venusaur had to frenzy plant exeggcutor to win the league. It was such a nice experience



So had there been any instance when you wished the version exclusives system didnt exist so that you could get all the mons of that region in one single game without having to trade?",2

1353,pokemon,"Okay, we’re off to a great start with the first episode of the Indigo League series! 😁
Ash, Pikachu, Gary, Professor Oak, Misty, and Delia (Ash’s mom) all had great character introductions! I feel like they also established the Pokémon world in a way that everyone could properly understand, dropping more and more facts as the episode went on! ☺️🙏

I only started considering changes whenever Ash started trying to capture Pokémon, like the Pidgey, Rattata, and Spearow he came across. But then I realized a few things:

The reason Ash didn’t catch Pidgey and Rattata was to highlight his lack of understanding of how to properly battle and capture Pokémon, and Spearow couldn’t have been captured because you can’t replace Ash’s awesome sacrifice for Pikachu near the end of the episode! ☺️

One thing I would think about reimagining is to uncensor the “Misty Slaps Ash in the Face Scene.” For those who don’t know, the original airing of this episode in Japan had Misty slap Ash in the face for thinking that she cared about his safety rather than Pikachu’s. The was cut in the English dub because of unnecessary violence between children.

While I think the slap was ENTIRELY unnecessary, it’s interesting to think about how people would’ve reacted to this scene if it was giving the OK by 4Kids (the anime’s English dubbers at the time).

What were y’all’s thoughts on the episode? What do you think could’ve been changed and/or added to make this episode better? 
Comment below, and I’ll see you later! 😁✌️",2
1354,pokemon,"Yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of the Pokémon anime, and boy was I excited for it! Nearly 1200 episodes, 23 movies, and many manga adaptations, the Pokémon anime has come a long way every since the very first episode.

Speaking of, this momentous occasion has gotten me all nostalgic, and I’ve decided to run through the entire Pokémon anime (up to Journeys until it is finished) and reimagine (or maybe fix) any episodes that I feel deserve that treatment! 

My posts won’t really have a schedule because I’m pretty busy a lot, so I’ll just watch the episodes when I can!

What episodes would you all like to see reimagined? What things would you fix about the Pokémon anime? What things would you add? How would you change already good episodes into better ones, or how would you change bad episodes into amazing episodes? 
Answer me in the comments below! ☺️🙏",2
1355,pokemon,"Let me explain myself. Some Pokemon types give you immunity to certain statuses, environments, etc. I think it would be neat if every type had a special property like that. I was inspired by a Youtube comment with the same idea. I'm not going to copy their ideas for specific types, though. I'll come up with my own. Besides, they said things like ""bug types should be able to hold two items"", which would be ridiculous. I'm gonna list the types and my ideas for special properties. If I think I need to explain it, I'll do it.

\-Normal: any damaging move used against them repeatedly will gradually lose power. For example, the power of Flamethrower would go from 90, to 80, to 70, etc. The counter resets every time the opponent uses a different move. Normal types are probably the most adaptable of all types (just look at all the TMs they can learn), so I think adapting to the opponent's moves makes sense for them. Don't worry, not all properties will be as complicated as this one.

\-Fighting: their attack can't be lowered by the opponent's moves. 

\-Flying: any Flying type move they use has the added effect of ""10% chance to raise the user's speed"". It's unaffected by Serene Grace. All that wind is gonna speed you up.

\-Poison: they already have it.

\-Ground: they're already immune to Sandstorm, but Rock types have that property plus having their Special Defense boosted while's it's active. It's only fair that Ground types also get something. They're immune to moves that would displace them (forced switching, Sky Drop, Telekinesis, etc.) They'll stay grounded, no matter what.

\-Rock: they already have it.

\-Bug: Priority moves go down one number when used against them. A lot of bugs in real life have borderline 180 degree vision. Good luck catching them off guard.

\-Ghost: they already have it.

\-Steel: they have both the immunity to Sandstorm and the immunity to being poisoned. They don't need more properties.

\-Fire: they already have it.

\-Water: contact moves used against them do 10% less damage. You try throwing a punch underwater. And no, I'm not counting Rain Dance. That affects Water type moves, not Water type Pokemon.

\-Grass and Electric: they already have it. I saved myself a line of text.

\-Psychic: can't be confused or infatuated. A smart Pokemon can see through the opponent's tricks.

\-Ice: they already have it.

\-Dragon: any Dragon type move they use has the added effect of ""10% chance to raise the user's attack"". It's unaffected by Serene Grace. I have no good explanation, this one is just to fill up the list.

\-Dark: they're already immune to Prankster-assisted moves, but I feel like that's too situational. Not that many Pokemon have Prankster. I wanna make is so that Dark types can't lose their items from the opponent's moves (Pluck, Knock Off, etc.) A thief believes everybody steals, after all.

\-Fairy: When they attack the opponent with a Fairy type move, the chances of their move's side effect activating goes up by 10%. It makes it easier of them to curse their opponents. This doesn't stack with Serene Grace; the ability simply replaces the property.

If you read through my wall of text, thank you. What do you think? Do you have any ideas of your own?",2
1356,pokemon,"alot of people hate the finale of the kalos league with ash losing to alan with most people sitting that he had a severe type advantage with his water type greninja against alans charizard. but thats kinda not fair since if you recall for the bulk of the fight charizard was in mega form at the time and transformed into a dragon type, this grants it some resistance to water moves slightly evening the playing field. i know it was disapointing due to ads tricking us into thinking ash would win but the actual type advantage thing is totally unjustifieda as charizard was part dragon.",2
1357,pokemon,"So much conflicting info everywhere. 

First of all for leaders, between bagon and poliwag, which one should I go for? Salamance shadow has amazing attack, but is pure glass, however, shadow politoed seems to have some pvp usage.

For super rocket radar, should I get aeroblast Lugia, or latias? I can’t seem to find much regarding how good shadow lugia is.

Thanks you!",2
1358,pokemon,"Which do you use? I changed over to set when I was no longer opposed to the added difficulty, though shift still has its uses in the early game for avoiding unwanted EVs.

Also, forgive me if this is no longer a thing in the modern games, I haven't played anything newer than DPP. I'm just curious 😁",2
1359,pokemon,Aight bois and girls its time to talk big. I'm sure all of you have bit into this subject one way or the other but I wanna know from all of you... What do you think the history of the world from the beginning to until now would be like if Mons were real? Would we be able to go cross country adventuring just like in the anime? If so at what age? What professional category would Pokémon training be in? And if not a trainer what profession would you rather have?,2
1360,pokemon,"I originally wrote this in a comment, but I think it's worthy of a post.

&gt;Reasoning: if you spend enough time in the tall grass and get your starter to Lv.60, it doesn't matter how ""hard"" the game is supposed to be. You'll just steamroll, as proven by speedruns.

My concept for an easy-to-implement challenge mode is having a setting where Pokemon's stats don't increase with the level. Instead, both Lv.1 and Lv.100 Pokemon will have stats calculated at Lv.50 (using the EVs, nature and IVs as usual). Levels will only be used to unlock new moves and evolve, and as a sign of how long you have trained your Pokemon.

This way:

* the gamemode is easily implemented

* the game is always a challenge and there's no way to just ""cheese"" the opponent 

* every single battle, even against Youngster Joey, will feel like a competitive game, just like in the anime.

* you get to use your Lv.100 pokemon without feeling bad about breezing through/not enjoying the game.

* No real need for traded pokemon to not obey you anymore.

&gt;this wouldn't require much in terms of further balance.

You may think: ""if wild pokemon are always at your level, running away will be harder"". 

This will finally give Pokemon with Runaway a reason to exist, and this applies to the Pokedoll and Smoke Ball items, too.

Also, routes with multiple trainers may trick you into thinking they'd be too hard. Luckily, varying your team's composition would be a lot easier, and since from SwSh onwards you always use pokemon from your boxes,this will only incentivize you using pokemon that aren't in your usual main party, as you can switch at any moment to that one Venonat in box 5, and it will be ready to fight.

I hear people in the back saying that the Pokemon League would be a nightmare.

It wouldn't. You'll still have access to your usual healing items.

It will be like having to fight 5 champions instead of only one, but after all, isn't that why they call them ""Elite""?",2

What if we could use an item to revert our Pokémon to lv.1, keeping all moves, evolutions, and EVs?

That way, we can make new save files where we get to play with late-game pokemon (like ice types) that we almost never get to use.",2
1370,pokemon,"With how older Pokémon have been getting new evolutions again recently, I've been thinking about what other Pokémon would benefit from new evolutions.  

So, let's see what cool Fakémon we can design!

The rules: 

A) No branched evolutions, only new stages, i.e; a 3rd stage for Pokémon that currently only have 2 stages, or a 2nd stage for a Pokémon that doesn't yet evolve.  So no Eeveelutions, new Hitmons, etc. 

B) The Pokémon getting an evolution MUST have a BST of 500 or lower.  So no Snorlax or Lapras evos.

C) The Pokémon getting an evolution MUST be NU or lower on Smogon's tier list for Sword &amp; Shield. If it's not available in Sword &amp; Shield, then it must be NU or lower in Sun &amp; Moon. So no Skarmory or Mimikyu evos.

D) Art of your Fakémon designs IS welcome, but not required.  A detailed description (typing, stats, moveset, appearance, etc) is just fine.

E) The Pokémon CANNOT already have a Mega Evolution.  Sorry Altaria and Pinsir.

F) Since Gen 9 is coming very soon, ANY generation from 1 through 8 is fair game.




Have fun!",2
1371,pokemon,Can someone trade back and forth with me to evolve my two Pokémon on brilliant diamond. I need to trade my kadabra and machoke. My Pokémon are at the correct level and I am willing to trade with anyone as long as they trade back.

1374,pokemon,"Ash should not have won based on worldbuilding, techniques and what we were shown and this could be how they plan on writing Cynthia's loss.

When they talked about pitting an elite 4 against Ash, I was already worried about how they would portray it. Alain beat Ash's most trained pokemon, Pikachu and Greninja with his Charizard and **then got beaten by an Elite 4 of Kalos** with little effort. An elite 4 is supposed to be a well trained, powerful trainer that has numerous techniques, and tricks and overall has pokemon capable of taking and dealing a reasonable amount of damage. They are quite literally part of the top 5 of the region and some has kept that title for years if not decades. So now how is it that Ash can grab two new pokemon that are hardly as trained as his Pikachu or Greninja (Dracovish is hardly trained at all!) and he is able to beat what I'm assuming is a top 3 elite 4 of Kalos?

It was evident that the writers had activate the strongest plot armor they had in order to let Ash win this battle that he does not deserve to win. Im all up for him growing and winning really good battles, but it has to be done in a believable way. He uses Dracovish instead of Dragonite or one of his better trained pokemon from other regions against and elite 4, for fighting type instead of making it a more narratively sensical battle by having a Steel/Fighting Mega Lucario go up against the Fairy/Dragon Mega Altaria he used Sirfetch'd. Visually you can tell that Drasna should've won by the power of her pokemon's attacks and her skillful training. Drasna fights with actual strategy and set up moves while all Ash did was spammed the x button. How does sirfetch tank like 3-4 powerful attacks, nearly faint (it really shouldve already fainted) gets put back in the ball and somehow has enough power to tank 3 more powerful hits, but the MEGA ALTARIA Who only actually got ""hit"" with watergun and a not very effective meteor assault against a +6 defense is taken down just like that? Dracovish has been slammed with dragon and fairy moves and constantly shakes it off with no issue. How is this a battle fans are expected to agree with? They are quite literally breaking world-building and continuity as well as applying unbelievable amounts of plot armor just to have Ash win a fight he clearly should not have. I'm not saying Ash doesnt have the skills and pokemon to beat an elite 4 in a 2 v 2 battle, but he clearly weren't using the team or signature on the fly techniques that would make it deserving. Dont even get me started on how the ranking system works, idk how Ash can fly from 15 to 9 like nothing from one battle. My biggest fear right now, is that they will do the same thing for Cynthia.",2

1376,pokemon,"For me, I think it would be Bounsweet in Alola. In Sun and Moon, you can't catch it in the wild until after the fourth trial (however there's an in-game trade earlier in the game), and by the time you can find it, you're already expected to have Steenee level wise. Bounsweet evolves at Level 18, but can only be found in the wild in Lush Jungle at Levels 18 to 21. Additionally, you'll be expected to have Tsareena soon too, as in Gen 7, Steenee learns Stomp at Level 29. In USUM, Bounsweet is only obtainable by breeding Steenee or Tsareena. I think that a good location for Bounsweet would be as another encounter in the berry piles on Melemele Island, like on Route 2. That way, you could find Bounsweet in the wild really early on without having to wait until the mid-game to find it with the in game trade. Bounsweet doesn't really feel like a mid-game mon to me, and I think it fits better as an early game wild encounter.",2
1377,pokemon,"I was planning on doing another sword play through and try and catch some Pokémon I hadn’t yet in Galar.

1381,pokemon,"Here is my bid to make the Pikachu line better both in Competitive and playthroughs. This might seem like a massive buff but I don't think they'd be overpowered even after this.



1st off. I would make Pikach's Stats identical to the Partner Pikachu from the Let's Go games. This makes a bit more bulky and quite a bit more powerful, as well as quite a lot faster. Still it's only 420 BST so good mid playthrough and by no means world beating in Competitive even with Light ball.



2nd, give Pichu Pikach's old stats. 320 BST makes it a decent baby Pokemon (still lower than Elekid or Magby). The tinychu might find itself a niche in Little Cup.



Finally, Give Raichu a buff based on the increases Pikachu got. Although give it 120 speed instead of 140 a direct translation would give.


This would result in


70 HP


115 attack


65 defense 


115 special attack


90 Special defense


120 speed

(Alolan Raichu would have its normal changes from Raichu)

Now yes, this is strong. 575 BST is slightly higher than the Kanto Birds. But I think A, it wouldn't be game breakingly good (although they would probably be quite good, Alolan Raichu especially). And B, it's Raichu, he needs some love and he rarely ever gets any.",2
1382,pokemon,"So, we have various special evolution methods, from stones to friendship to specific move-types, but not a regular, no-strings-attached, level-up evolution for Eevee. Of course, that makes sense, given it's whole gimmick. But, eventualy, does anyone think it's likely at all? if so, How and why do you think it would get implemented?

Bonus, if you're interested, what unused type eeveelution(s) do you a) want and b) actually think they're gonna do next? Or if you have any other suggestions for any mechanics surrounding eevee, I'm interested. Personally, I'm looking forward to dual-type third-stages for existing eeveelutions. I really want dual-type eevee-line mons, but it donesn't feel right for second-stages; but if they ever get third-stages, it would make perfect sense to add a type, to diversify the family more. Don't think that's likely anytime soon though.

I honestly just want this pokemon to not remain unreleased while also getting a pre-evolution and evolution of the same type (eternal flower flabebe and eternal flower florges, especially florges) in a game set in the past of Kalos like how Legends Arceus is set in past Sinnoh (Hisui).",2

I want more arcs like how Pokemon Legends Arceus where we get more time in locations and characters.

I want more team battles. Odd we haven't had much in Journeys just like we did in Sun &amp; Moon. 

I'd be down for Goh staying or leaving, either one would be cool.

Bring back a female traveling companion. I don't hate Chloeharu but I would like our female characters to be more active. Or give us a female rival like Bea expect she's the main rival.

That's just me though. What about y'all?",2
1398,pokemon,"I **personally** think that present Anime ""Pokémon Journeys"" is not that good as Pokémon used to be in the past.

First the Animation.

Even on the start of this anime, artstyle was charming and appealing where Ash and other characters (some Pokémons too) had this sharper touch to them. All the way to the X &amp; Y series it holded this style and that was a good decision. In X &amp; Y, there was the animation the best. Even Ash looked tough and not over the top childlish and kid friendly. Battle animations were back then simpler but when you look how they then were mega improved in the X &amp; Y, and then you look how they were again nerfed in the Sun and Moon/Journeys, where the action moves are simpler and cheaper.

The Characters

The largest milestone in this anime so far was definitely X &amp; Y series, which I will mention several times more. There Ash and other Characters had solid execution and weren't ruined in order to try to be extremely kid friendly. Today's Pokémon Journeys contains way too many comedy and happy tone, which only downgrades the show when you compare it again to X &amp; Y. That season was tough, had powerful and serious times, which made it so good. Yes, they now introduce quantity of old characters, like Dawn, Paul, Greninja or Elite Four Flint, but it doesn't feel refreshing. They appear only in few episodes and they're not as enjoyable as they were in original episodes.

If You personally like Pokémon Journeys, good for you, I'm not mad at you at all. This is my opinion and what I would do if I could write Pokémon episodes. Do you agree with my problems on recent Pokémon Anime, or not?",2

1403,pokemon,"I'll just jump into, So far; Sword/Shield and Legend Arceus has been EXTREMELY kind to the Johto Pokedex now;

With **Typholison,** **Corsola, Stantler, Qwilfish and even Ursaring** getting an upgrade.

I post a question talking about which Johto pokemon you want to see get a a regional upgrade or some upgrade,

I chose Johto, because Its one of my favorite region in terms of Pokemon and I know people are tired of talking about Kanto wank lol

So I looked at all the Johto Pokemon never got any upgrade (New type, Mega, Gigantimax) and chose the Top 5 I would like to see get upgrade based on their origins and how it can benefit them, So here they are:

**Hoothoot/Noctowl - Nomral/flying --&gt; Steel/Flying:**

I often associate Owls with Clocks; Since they're portrayed as Smart in fiction

So I can see a Regional Noctowl become a Steel/Flying having clocks as its theme; Also have get an evolution where its final form is based off of a Grandfather Clock; that would be sick!

**Spinarak/Ariados - Bug/Poison --&gt; Bug/Ground:**

I think this is pretty straight forward, there are many types of Spiders in the real world, so a Regional form of Ariados could be anything, But I think a Bug/Ground would be rare to see, because there are only two Bug/Ground type Pokemon \[Nincada and Wormadam\]

Regional Ariados would be based on **Trap Door Spiders** specifically, so Bug/Ground would be a fasicinating type to see. Would need a new evolution, maybe, but I don't know what they would do it except make a bigger spider, but who knows right?

**Ledyba/Ledian - Bug/Flying --&gt; Bug/Fighting:**

Ledian is basically the Parasect of the Johto region; Mainly because Ledian is so pathetic the only thing going for is special defense, it evolves extremely early, but doesn't really get much better for it.

Ledian DESPERATLY needs a Regional Buff, reason is because there is so much potential for it, Ledian is suppose to based off of Superheroes, Ledian has that ""Toku"" Genre look to it, I can see Maybe Ledian stay on the ground, Have it be more superhero-ish, like Ultraman.

Maybe it can pose like ""Super Sentai"" with a new evolution.

Maybe a Regional Ledyba/Ledian can based on the ""Super Sentai"" (think Power Rangers); a Red Ledian, Blue Ledian, Yellow Ledian, Black Ledian, Pink Ledian.

**Chinchou/Lanturn - Water/Electric ---&gt; Ghost/Electric:**

Now I came up with this today, because I was excited thinking about the possibilities of this. Lanturn always fascinated me for awhile because its rare typing of Water and Electric, meaning it can give most types a tough time.

However, Thanks to Hisuian Qwilfish; Lanturn doesn't have to stay a Water type. Anglerfish live in the deep depths of the ocean, So I was thinking either Dark/Electric or Electric/Ghost; Since they're both rare unsual dual types where only have rotom and Morpeko.

Lanturn being Ghost/Electric sounds so cool! I think It would need a third evolution as well.

**Dunsparce - Normal ---&gt; Normal/Dragon:**

Dunsparce.....just Dunsparce.

Dunsparce has now become somewhat of Meme in these last few years as the ""GIVE HIM AN EVOLUTION!!"" Which Im on that hype train. Dunsparce is just a child waiting to be released in the world again, I think sooner GameFreak is going to have to cave in and give Dunsparce fans what we want!

Personally, Normal/Dragon would be such an out there type, That I think It can work; and please give this thing an EVOLUTION!!

I'll give an example of a couple frames I'm working on for various eeveelutions. 

Flareon; a lava flow made from black felt and red pearlescent craft glue. The felt is bulged up in places and hit with black and grey markers to look more like cooled lava. The glue is combined with fine orange and black glitter for a bit of color variation and to create a ""glow"" without lights.

Vaporeon; a beach scene made from sand and crushed blue glass. The sand is mostly at the bottom of the frame and mixed with small stones of the same color. Small tufts of cotton are mixed in with the blue glass to form sea foam and crashing waves.

Jolteon; thunder clouds made from cotton balls dyed dark grey with yellow cord woven throughout to make lightning.

Leafeon; moss and leafy garland to invoke a forest. A couple small twigs are hidden in the moss.

Glaceon; a mixture of crushed white glass, clear/white glitter confetti, a couple torn up cotton balls create a snowfield. The effect is similar to miniature village displays around the holidays.",2

I threw away the box and manual for each handheld game I got. Black 2? In the trash. Platinum? Garbage. Nintendo even subconsciously promoted this by having their official DS:3DS carrying bags have slots for tons of cartridges…but, you know, only the cartridge. No space for boxes.

My loose copies could be worth more than double their price if I had just held onto their boxes. Additionally, I want to display my copies, and I will either have to buy uglier reproduction cases off of EBay, or spend $40-$50 (and that’s just for the DS games) on a PIECE OF PLASTIC because it’s authentic.

Are official strategy guides no longer popular enough to justify making them? (sad if this is true...)

Are they more popular in Japan?

Why release a strategy guide so late after the release of the game? Is there a good reason for this or was it just last minute planning by Nintendo?

Anyone know if it will actually release in America?",2

Hi, so I recently bought an Xbox one x, the guy at GameStop recommended this PDP dual charger thing. I put in the rechargeable battery, the lid it came with, and set it on the sticky platform thingy to try to charge. I had the thing plugged in for over an hour before setting my controller on it to try to charge. As I put the controller on it, it lit up which I assumed meant it's charging. I went to go cook for half an hour, came back to check, my battery is still only halfway as it was when I started charging. Is it slow to charge, and is the battery icon on the Xbox one supposed to have a charging icon? No such icon displays..thanks

1637,xboxone,"I am a bit late finding this out but I did not realise the USB ports on the Xbox One are permanently on even in full shutdown mode, I have always had the external drive in back facing forward so never saw the light on the front.

So I was just wondering if the external HDD that are advertised as being for Xbox can cope with being powered on all the time for years compared with a ""normal"" external HDD?

Bit of back story, I bought 2 WD 4TB external drives at the same time and after about 2.5 years the one on the Xbox stopped working where the one on the PS4 was fine (and still is a couple of years later).

The faulty one I got replaced under the guarantee and now use that newer one as my data backup, I have a really old WD 2TB on the Xbox One that used to be the data backup drive and the one that used to be connected to the PS4 is now unused as I have a PS5 with an added external SDD which I use more.

1. add the x 3 12month xbox gold to your account
2. Sign up to the ultimate pass and skip the renewal offer (because 3 years is the cap)
 

And off I go, BUT what if I already created and account with xbox and used the ultimate $1.00 thing already?

Must I create a new account or can I just work off the existing account I created (the one I'm currently using for gaming on xbox/PC).

What I read so far is:
1.Turn off renew membership via the Microsoft website
2. Wait till my membership expires for GPU 
3. Add the x3 gold pass subscription giftcards in
4. Go on Microsoft's website and select do the $1.00 for 1 month (it won't work as I've already done the $1.00 renewal)
5. It should ask me somewhere during the prompts if I want to ""upgrade"" my gold pass to GPU and done! 

Obviously rejecting and renewal offer they have as it will push me over the 12 months.

Hope to get an answer for the question:
Will it still work if I've already done the xbox GPU $1.00 thing and get charged a full month only ($16) or whatever it is.

Are there any games beyond FPS titles where you work together to accomplish something?

Ok no big deal, I'll just go to the website through MS Edge.  Log into the website and get to the first episode of halo, try to start it up and nothing happens just a spinng wheel icon, second red flag.  Go to the Microsoft website to see if I can download an app from there to my phone and that is where I saw that it's not available in Canada for the first time in this entire process.

1717,xboxone,"Just my rant about my disappointment with this console. I still adore Xbox 360 but can't say the same about Xbox One. It has a lot of problems and I had a gaming PC so I don't even needed it. I only bought it because I claimed Xbox One gold games on 360 and thought I could have some fun but it turned out I need gold subscription to play them unlike 360 gold games. Even free online games required gold subscription. Then my Xbox One X was defective and stopped launching after update. I replaced it with Xbox One S because I was dumb enough to buy digital games on Xbox store. Xbox One had no true exclusives like PlayStation, no VR, even lost Kinect support(there weren't any good Kinect games anyway). Most of the games were stuttering or lagging. The only good thing Xbox One had is backward compatibility for Xbox Original and 360 games. I wish I would just bought PlayStation 4 with VR headset. Xbox Series S, X again just pointless if you have gaming PC.",3

2. If not, how can I transfer the data from the OG Xbox to the Series X?  
I imagine its something to do with moving as much as I can onto the 1TB hard drive, and then safely unplugging this and plugging it into the Series X, then download what is on the hard drive onto the Series X, and then repeat once more. Can someone validate that for me? Or is there a better way to do it?

1794,xboxone,"Hi everyone!

So I'm currently thinking about purchasing an Xbox Series S, because it looks like a really good value at 300€. 

I've been gaming on a PC my entire life and never owned a console, so there are a few things I'm not sure about.

I'm not a fan of subscriptions so I'll probably skip Xbox Gold and Game Pass. I heard that you don't need Xbox Gold to play free games online, is that true? Can I play Rocket League for example without the ""multiplayer subscription""?

How is the overall user experience? If I plug in a keyboard and mouse will I be able to navigate Youtube and Twitch smoothly? 

I'm also curious about game cross-compatibility. I purchased Forza Horizon 4 on Steam and was required to log in with a Microsoft account. If I open the Xbox app on my phone, I can see Forza Horizon 4 in my list of games. Does that mean I will be able to play FH4 without needing to purchase it again?

What are your feelings about the Series S? What are your experiences with it like? Does it stand up to it's hype about performance? 

I'm happy to hear all your feedback! If you think purchasing it is a good idea or whether I should just keep playing on PC (which I don't intend on stopping btw, just felt like playing a few chill games on the couch lately).

Thank you to everyone who decides to read and comment on this post!",3

1813,xboxone,"With the recent stock of Series X (check Walmart if you're still looking) I decided to upgrade up from the base XBone. But I am already regretting parting with 500$ and may cancel the order. Is it really worth the upgrade?

 I use my current as a media center in addition to games (Spotify, DVD player, streaming services) and those all run fine on Xbox one... Loading times for even newer games like Elden ring seem alright, am I basically just paying 500 dollars for faster loading but otherwise more of the same?

1814,xboxone,"Hello all, 
I’ve just bought [this 
wireless headset](https://www.lucidsound.com/p/gaming-headsets/xbox/xbox-series-x-s/wireless/ls15x-wireless-gaming-headset-for-xbox/) that comes with a USB dongle. Works great for me but today I wanted to use my stereo system rather than the headset, and I’ve noticed that while plugged in, the dongle kept searching for the headset (it emits a white pulsating light). Apart from it being a minor nuisance, I don’t think it’d be too good for the dongle to keep doing that, so I plugged it off.
That got me thinking, if I have to keep plugging the dongle on and off, will the Series X’s USB port wear out too fast? Should I buy a USB cord extender like [this video suggests?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1qIwjtvf4c) or am I worrying too much over nothing?",3

1857,xboxone,"Hello, I have a pretty good home theater and I recently added an Arcam amplifier because the Denon receiver really couldn't make the Bowers and Wilkins speakers breath as they should. 

I added Amazon Music Unlimited to re-evaluate the system because Tidal through Plex is not MQA quality and it turns out that Amazon sounds better. I listen to music in stereo through the tower speakers. 

Upon firing up Amazon, I was a little stunned how much better an Amazon HD playlist sounded than Plex with Tidal. It dawned on me that I had set the HDMI out to Headphones in the Xbox settings and then I thought something else has to be different because I already evaluated the system after the new amplifier was added a couple of weeks ago, so I selected every other HDMI option and all of them sounded diminished and much less alive or robust than when I had headphones for HDMI selected. 

Now, I am spoiled and do not want to listen to it any other way but realistically that is not the best idea because I have an in-ceiling Atmos system. 

I am thinking that the signal may be boosted through the HDMI output when headphones are selected so one can be more competitive when wearing headphones? 

I cross referenced the Amazon app from my TV, but it was lesser as well, but slightly better than the Xbox for Netflix and comparable to my Netflix app in the stand alone Blu-ray player. Maybe I need a pre-amp, I'm not sure but I have been missing out on the systems ability for a couple of years already without a separate amplifier.

1863,xboxone,"Hello Guys,

Since the Series S|X Update for Cyperpunk 2077 was released, I was heading back into the Game and I realize that the aiming specially for Controller is really bad. After experimenting with the settings I found the solution. After you turn off all additional sensitivity settings in the Advanced settings you configure your ADS Settings with the normal horizontal and vertical sensitivity if you find a Sensitivity that you comfortable with you start putting in the advanced setting the horizontal and vertical rotation boost this setting will not affect the ADS Sensitivity and you should put the horizontal and vertical rotation at the same value or it becomes weird and here you go now you can enjoy Cyperpunk 2077 on console without weird or trash Aiming problems   I put a Link for a Screenshot as an example for what I mean it is in German but I can describe it for you guys 8 and 4 is my Sensitivity and the two 1.00 is my rotation bonus you can copy those settings If you want but a little disclaimer it is more for the low Sensitivity players

1878,xboxone,"This has probably happened to others, but is situational to my daughters who have just got into Minecraft. Mainly, one of their world's.

She's spent the last few months getting into Minecraft and building some great things that have really surprised me, as I've not played it in years.

She's been mostly playing on my Series X but a few times played on my One X. A few weeks ago, she realised things she built on the One X, wasn't in the world on the Series X, despite the world ""syncing"" to the cloud. So she just continued building on the Series X. I've now brought the Series X into my office and set the One X in the living room, but again, despite the world saying it's up to date it's missing a month's worth of building. So I deleted the local save, but it kept syncing the ""out of date"" world.  After removing her profile, it then said the world is corrupt and to play it on a working console for a while, and let it sync. I did that for around 15 mins, quit and said it synced. Which again, didn't work. It seems it was in such a state, that it didn't save to the cloud properly. And since you can no longer backup a save to USB anymore, delete from everywhere would have meant losing her world.  Now, it shows as corrupt on both consoles and can no longer load.

Either the ability to backup saves or delete cloud only data would have easily resolved this, and I've not had the heart to tell them they've lost all the building they've done.  I've reached out to Microsoft to see if there's anything they can do, but I'm highly doubtful anything can be.",3

1886,xboxone,"**Every** review of the game on Xbox right now is 1 star and asking the question of: *""How do I play the game now that I've bought it?""*  


The trick is, GTA V series S/X is **actually GTA Online**. You need to run GTA Online to play ""story mode"" (single player) GTA V.   


After one hour, I figured it out. Here's how:  


The game is **not** a free upgrade. You need to purchase the Series S/X version to get 4k, ray tracing, and 60 FPS. Right now it is in the store for half off, which means you can buy the ""story mode"" (single player) for $10, and GTA Online for $10. There is also a bundle to buy them together for $20.  


Here is where things get tricky. I bought both, so I'm not sure of what happens if you try to play story mode (single player), but do not have GTA Online.  


1. Purchase GTA V Series S/X **and** GTA Online.
   1. Can someone confirm what happens if you purchase **only** GTA V series S/X and see which title actual appears in your library?
2. Your library will now have GTA Online. Launch that.
3. Once GTA Online launches, you will have the option to select GTA Online **OR** GTA V Story Mode (single player)

  
Why they would hide the single player game inside multiplayer, I have no idea.  


**How to transfer your saves from GTA V -&gt; GTA V Series S/X**  


1. Launch your old version of GTA V
2. Load your latest save
3. In the options menu you'll now have the opportunity to upload **one** save to Rockstar
4. Upload your save
5. Launch the Series S/X version of GTA V (follow steps above)
6. In the settings menu, you can download/load your save from Rockstar",3

1908,xboxone,"Apologies for the long winded post, but I'm frustrated with the support I've received from Microsoft on this product. Timeline below:

1. I received the Elite Controller Series 2 as a Christmas gift in December 2021. The left bumper of the controller that had come with my Series X had become almost unusable, so I was excited to have a fully functioning controller again.
2. I began using the controller about mid-January. Roughly two weeks after I first began using the controller, it stopped turning on. I plugged it into the charger, left it charging overnight, tried plugging it into my laptop per recommendation of submitting a question on the Xbox help site, but it wouldn't turn on
3. A few days after that, I randomly tried turning it on again and it worked with no issues for a few games of Overwatch. I thought it was a weird error and was hoping the issue was behind me. After about 45 minutes of play time, the controller remained on, but disconnected from the Xbox and I received the ""please reconnect your Xbox controller"" screen in-game. Nothing I tried would reconnect it and I ended up getting kicked out of the game and a 15 minute comp ban lol
4. At this point, I decide I'm going to submit a warranty claim so I register my controller with my Xbox account. I click through the steps online until I get to the part where I'm required to pay for shipping and supply packaging to ship this controller in. The site also mentions that the customer must ensure packaging is sufficient so that the controller is not damaged in transit.
5. In early February I called the support line at this time to ask if there was any way to receive a prepaid label since I thought it was a bit odd that I'd have to pay out of pocket for service on a controller that only functioned for 2 weeks. After about an hour and 45 minutes on the phone with support, and being transferred to a supervisor, I was told that they were going to check if FedEx could pick up the package for me, and since I mentioned that this was my only fully functioning controller, they were going to check if they could send me a complimentary standard controller as well. I thought this was a generous offer and I thanked them for this. I got off the phone after being told I'd hear back from them shortly with an update.
6. Two weeks went by and I had heard nothing from Microsoft. During this time I was also packing for an apartment move, which will be relevant shortly. I received a phone call from the original support rep I had spoken to, and she let me know that they heard back from their internal team, and not only was my complimentary controller not approved, but FedEx would not be picking up the controller either, and I am back to square one, having to pay for shipping and packaging myself.
7. I told her I understood that she's just enforcing the policy but the amount of time this has taken, and my controller has been unusable, is frustrating, and she let me know that she would expedite my service as soon as I could send the controller in. We went through the steps again of collecting my info, and I informed her that I would be moving apartments soon so I'd need to know the timeframe for the return, as my shipping address would be changing depending on when the controller is shipped back. She let me know that she couldn't provide a date, and once the order is created they have no way of changing the shipping address. She suggested she call back at the beginning of March when I moved, so we could process the order then.
8. That was roughly mid-February, and I have not heard anything from Microsoft since

1923,xboxone,"Disclaimer: I am a casual Halo fan, played games 1-4 (hundreds of hours in 2's split screen) and just downloaded Infinite. I read the *Fall of Reach* book but that's about it.

Alamo Drafthouse had an early screening tonight of the 2-part premier. I had heard bad things and wasn't impressed with the trailers, but figured it would be kinda fun.

And it was!

I went in not expecting much and was actually pleasantly surprised. Yes, there were plenty of flaws, but none of them were deal breakers for me. It felt very much in the same ballpark as *The Expanse*, though not as grounded or personal (yet) in terms of the universe. Acting was comparable and it felt similar in scope, though Halo clearly had more money for effects (which were excellent for the most part). Pacing was good, sounds and sets were great, and there are a lot of questions I'm just interested enough to care about answering.

It clearly isn't the best sci-fi ever (or even recently). But it's good enough that I'm gonna see if anyone in my family has a P+ account. If not, I actually might sign up. It looks like it could scratch that ""sci-fi action flick"" itch that Boba really didn't.

I use the Elite 2 to awaken my One X console and after it launches, the controller becomes unresponsive, only button that works is the power button on the controller, no sticks, no Dpad, no buttons. I turned off the console and controller and nothing would unfreeze it. I power cycled the console and nothing. last ditch effort involved using the USB cable from the charging dock. My sequence below solved the issue. 

I took the USB cable from the charging dock and connected the controller to the console. With controller connected and on, I did a hard reset of the console by holding down the Console Power button, power cable unplugged for 30 seconds. Disconnected the USB cable from the controller. Plugged power cable back in and launched the console with the Elite 2 power button. Console came alive and controller was now fully functional. 

So the only difference was connecting the controller via USB and then force shutdown of the console by holding the Console power button for 10 seconds until it's off.  

I said it did this twice... I returned the first controller on BestBuy Warranty, $60, and replaced it. the second time was today with 4 month old controller #2. Had I tried this with Elite 2 #1 I might have saved myself $60 and 2 hour drive.",3

2022,leagueoflegends,"Hey everybody (specially toplane mains). I saw a post on this subreddit, something like ""Ornn was the last TANK TOP and it was released 5 years ago"". Reav3 responded to that post with ""I guess we have to do something about this soon"". I wonder what kind of TANK TOP will we get? How cool would be to have a champion that has the passive: immune to CC except slow. For example: If you are Morgana and hit a Q on the tank toplaner, the tank top will get a slow instead of stun (or whatever is called Morgana's Q). That passive works to every kind of CC in the game (Morgana Q, Varus R, Leona QER, Nautilus basic attack Q and R, etc) EXCEPT SLOWS. How cool would be to see that in League of Legends?

2041,leagueoflegends,"I'll be starting a new weekly series where I talk about which champs need help and which champs need nerfed.  Every Monday I'll be talking about the state of the meta and what needs to happen.

Buffs

Aphelios, Ryze, Renekton, Thresh and Gwen champs are just straight  trash right now.  That said I think he won't be seeing buffs, due to tardo games caring too much about pro play.

Kaisa the removal of Ravenous hunter has hurt her badly causing her to lose 1.5% WR, I'm talking about her bot lane win rate which is now 48%.  This has nothing to do with Kaisa mid which is a 44% troll pick that's being played quite a bit right now due to the rampant Faker fan boys.  My suggestion is reverting the Q CD nerfs from last season since this will mean much more bot than it will in mid lane.

Varus the on hit version of Varus should be buffed he's a high skill champ when played on hit instead of lethality.  I think the hard part will be finding a way to buff on hit and make sure the low skill lethality build doesn't take over the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Nerfs

Veigar Champ is super easy to play and super OP at a 54% win rate in bot lane he's also 51% in mid lane.  This means there's room to nerf him without making him useless.  Suggestion is simply undoing the Q buffs he got earlier this season.

Heimerdinger Mages are an issue in bot lane and have been for multiple season now.  My suggestion is making his turrets less durable to offer a better chance of killing them quickly.

Karthus another mage taking over bot lane suggestion is further lowering his armor so he can actually lose all ins without getting a kill trade even through his passive.  Alternatively lowering his Q damage again same goal making it so he can be successfully all ined.

Quinn completely broken ever since the TP changes this season my suggestion is increasing the CD of Vault significantly to offer more counterplay for melee champs.  16/15/14/13/12 would be my suggestion.

Riven champ has been OP this entire season and is in need of some big nerfs my suggestion is nerfing her E CD.

Aurelion Sol and Pyke Mid

I don't see Asol enough and I also don't play him so I can't comment fairly on what nerfs he needs but I can say he definitely does need nerfed.

The play rate of Pyke mid has tripled since the start of this season.  Pyke is such a cool concept when played in his intended role as a support, sadly it's too easy for him to roam and he can basically force this play style on the game by ignoring the lane and perma roaming bot.  To understand why Pyke mid is so bad for solo queue you need to understand how you beat it.  You basically beat it by having your bot lane never go aggressive and respect that he will perma roam bot lane.  This makes for a very boring game for the enemy ADC and support who are likely to get fed up with this boring playstyle and then die to Pyke and lose the game.

My suggestion is finding a way to lock him out of solo lanes.  My suggestion is making it so his Ultimate won't work without a support item.  I'm sure riot could come up with some other creative solutions but at the end of the day he needs to be kept out of solo lanes.",4

I heard that today's meta is ""everyone oneshots eyeryone"" and I looked at [u.gg](https://u.gg) for Gwen's winrate and it's one of the worst in the game.   


so what certianly happened, why is she so bad right now, did she get nerfs or the new meta or changed items don't favor her so much? Also many immobile tanks right now like Tahm, Garen, Ornn and Yorick has one of the highest winrates rn so still I am confused why she is so bad and if I still can pick her against tanky top?  


P. S. I am not Gwen main by any means but I always wanted to learn her and become one, I get special joy playing on hit ap champions especially in top. I usually play tanks which helps me a lot with her because I excatly know how to counter micro wise and macro wise most of them and I know what limits they have.  
I play at mid platinum level and easily would be better but my macro often sucks ass and isn't calmy thought out as much as I wished which often leads me in mid game to disadvantage and ""what the fuck should I do rn now mode"" but it can be helped and worked on with no big deal.

Mainly as many assasins or even Marksman build 1 or 2 Bruiser items

2064,leagueoflegends,"This is a rough and abridged translation of a post in the League of Legends Gallery of DCINSIDE. Today, reporter Yeonjae Shin of Inven in a youtube stream revealed her estimations of the LCK team payrolls based on her talks with insiders. (These estimates are only of the players in the main rosters, and do not include transaction fees. I don't know whether the options are included or not. The payroll for LCK teams rose exponentially in the past few years, a growth comparable to that of crypto prices.)

&amp;#x200B;

10th: Fredit Brion - less than 820k

9th: HLE - about 1.25mil

They did compete for free agents in the offseason but lost out a lot

8th: Liiv Sandbox - about 1.5mil (maybe more than 1.65)

6,7th: Kwangdong or Nongshim

The reporter is not so sure about their rankings, but both teams' salaries are around 3.3mil, give or take.

5th: KT - more than 4.1mil

The team didn't spend much in 2021, but they really invested this year, and in summer they will definitely do better with Vicla as a starter.

4th: DRX - about 4.9mil

The botlane duos are really expensive, and Zeka's salary is definitely lower than 1.6mil.

3rd: DK - definitely more than 5mil and definitely more than DRX

2nd: Gen.g - at least 5.8mil

Understandable considering the name value of the players. She also notes that the star players' salaries are not as high as one might think but the middle players' salaries are quite higher than expected.

1st: T1 - about 8.2mil (But she says that info of T1 is quite limited)

She also notes that the team's salary minus Faker would not be the 1st, and also that for 2020, T1's operating costs were around 10mil in their released financial statements.

(BTW obviously they are all dollars)

&amp;#x200B;

Further comments

\*When she started working in 2015, star players got paid less than 800k. Now they get paid at least 1.6mil.

\*As for Nuguri, it's solely up to him to decide whether to return or not.

\*Her most surprising transaction during her career was Rekkles joining G2.

&amp;#x200B;

\*After the stream, the vice president of DK posted a tweet implying that DK's team payroll was way more than what the reporter suggested and that he would be really happy if he could run a team with the estimated amount of money (5mil).

I get that EU Masters is all about the European regions, and therefore more localized broadcasts, but there is also England, *where people speak English*, and apparently they do not have their own broadcast? Not to mention that you lack an American audience this way.

The EU Masters Twitter account is active, by the way, but they haven't posted any links to an English broadcast.",4

2073,leagueoflegends,"I like a champion with a good wave clear and farm well. I also like AD champs because they can farm fast, deal lots of damage over time, and get turrets down quick. But, I also like to keep at a distance and wait for the enemy to roam so I can start chipping away at their turret. I mostly let my minion wave do the work for me while I recall and buy some items. Long distance range and good kitting is what I’m usually looking for, melee fights are not what I’m looking for. 

just to give you an idea of who I like to play: I play Teemo, Seraphine, and recently Kayle. 
Teemo because I don’t always have to fight to deal damage, Seraphine because she can do well in team fights and has good wave control and burst late game, and Kayle because her AD is really good and deals lots of damage. 

If anyone has a champion that fits that type of play style, please tell me. Thanks!",4
2074,leagueoflegends,"First off, when Akali ults you, there are 2 main combos she will do, either she will r1+E+ignite to guarantee the E damage, and if you didnt flash her initial r1+e you have flash to flash her r2, only that the problem is that her r2 is instant, so it becomes more of a luckbased mindgame rather than outplaying her, akin to Malphite ulting you near melee range.

Scenario 2 is that Akali r1 ignites you, you try to dodge the E because you think she needs it to have enough damage to kill you, she never uses it, she uses r2 and you are at 10-15% health and you flash away, and she just flashes after and q's for the kill and then uses E to escape.

Most other assassins has some key ability that has a cast time that you at the very least flash away from it(zed q, fizz q+r on minion, katarina dagger, nocturne fear, ekko q/w/e/r etc etc), or exhaust them(doesnt work on akali because she just waits out the exhaust in the shroud while you are unable to attack her)

In the toplane, its pretty much the same except toplane champions usually have to be poked down to 80% hp, but since most are melee akali has no problem to do so.

All in all the akali pretty much has to play bad in order for you to live, and in high elo that basically never happens because everyone knows what Akali does.",4

2080,leagueoflegends,"NOTE: This is a repost (from 28th March) in order to reach more people - for obvious reasons, given the nature of the post topic. If you have already read the original post, sorry for bothering you.

Fellow League players, fans, supporters and connoisseurs,

my name is Vojta, I am known as ""Crtk"" in gaming world, and I am a student of marketing and trade at Technical University of Ostrava (Czech Republic).

As part of my university diploma thesis, I decided to carry out a research aimed to analyze consumer behaviour of League players. The key element of the research is a questionnaire survey; hence, I turn to this subreddit with my plea for help.

I would like to kindly ask each and every one of you for five minutes of your time. If you could spare that much (will not take more) and fill in the questionnaire in the link, I would be ever so grateful.

The questionnaire is, as I mentioned above, about consumer behaviour; basically, I am trying to find out whether players buy in-game stuff, how much they are willing to spend on it, what motivates them to buy etc. You can find more information in the screen right after you click on the link. While the questionnaire asks for some information about yourselves, it does not need to know your name or any sensitive personal information - it is completelly anonymous.

I hope that some of you can find those few minutes to help fellow gamer; I also believe that maybe, one day, I will be able to repay the favour.

Thank you and I wish you all the best in your lives.

He has been playing at an amazing level since 2018 and the only years in which he didn't reach at least semis at Worlds since 2016 were 2017 and 2021.

2089,leagueoflegends,"A friend of mine is recently getting into following the Pro league of legends scene, and he really likes Bjergsen. I wanted to show him an older clip of Bjerg making a strong outplay on Zed back in his Copenhagen Wolves / NIP days. I can't seem to locate the clip, but I remember it was ~15-25 minutes into the game, he was splitting in bottom lane, and IIRC he kills Vladimir. After his play on Vlad, a stealthed Evelynn tries to get a counter kill, but he outplays Evelynn super hard too. I'm not 100% sure on the Vladimir kill, but I remember thinking ""Damn, not only did Bjerg outplay Evelynn, his reaction time from Eve coming out of stealth is actually insane"".

I have just experienced my third game this season where a toxic player goes afk (standing in the fountain intentionally trying to make us lose) and the notification for the early surrender pops up quickly after just 3 minutes. 

This however sparks the whole team to surrender while the afk player types from fountain only to see that despite the prompt for someone being afk there is no penalty or LP loss reduction for the game. 

This is only punishing people who did nothing wrong and giving the AFK/trolling player more satisfaction as they can hold a game hostage if they can get that quick early surrender vote in with no punishment. Please fix your god toxic game Riot.",4

2094,leagueoflegends,"I started playing league recently and my first rank was Bronze 1. I kept it up for a while but after a bunch of lazy games I totally lost a lot of rank and I'm now bronze IV.
Many games I get a great score like 10/3 or even 15/4. But that does rarely take our team to victories. I play adc and I'm so frustrated that it doesn't take more than one single bad player or a bad support to totally make us lose big time.
Also I'm having a hard time ranking up gain cause it seems like I'm always matched up with bad players. 

My question is: do I get matched up with worse players because I've losed a lot?

What position should I try to get good at to rank at solo/duo? I play a lot with my friend who plays support but even though we play good we are always matched up with really bad players and eventually we lose even though we rank high in K/D/A and champion damage.",4
2095,leagueoflegends,"For a long time Gemstones were only available from chests at a 2.68% chance to drop. This means as a F2P player you would need to open roughly 400 chests (over 8 years worth on average) to get enough gemstones to acquire a coveted Hextech Skin. Hextech Skins have always been some of the most exclusive and rarest skins in the game. (Sure there are rarer skins but those are really really rare) Seeing a hextech skin in a game used to make you go ""oh damn"" like this person really put in years of their time and devoted their 10 gems to get a skin. It took me about 3 years to get my first one. 

Now the conversion has happened and the issue that I have with it the most is not the conversion rate, 10 for 1 seems fine at face value, but then the shop for mythic skins is completely upside down. Now you have low effort skins costing double the cost of the old hextech skins. 

When I say low effort I dont mean in quality or looks... Example: any prestige skin took less than a month to acquire in game. You used to be able to trade 2200 of any event currency to get 100 prestige points. Which would have unlocked a prestige skin. So why are some prestige skins being priced at what equates to 16.6 years worth of gemstone farming for F2P players? 


If they really want to try and say that these skins are better than the hextech/gemstone skins and push them as the more exclusive flavor that's fine.. It's Whatever.. But then the exchange rate for current gemstones feels bad based on the amount of time devoted to earning them before hand. 

Prestige point skins in the past were much easier to get than gemstone skins. League has about 5 major events per year. Most of those have 1 gemstone as a mission if you buy the bundle and complete it. But it was fairly easy to get 100 prestige points by trading in your 2200 tokens given the time frame in which you had to do so. 

That means in a given calendar year the game would give you 5 prestige skins assuming you played enough to earn 2200 tokens. They also give you 1 gemstone per event so about half an opportunity to get a gemstone skin in the same time frame. If we factor in rng drops from chests... That's 104 potential chests in 2 years at a drop rate of 2.68% so call it 3. That is a total of 10 prestige skins = 13 gemstones. Or.. A prestige skin was worth about 1.3 gemstones. 

But now... Prestige skins = 125 magic essence which was 12.5 gemstones. Yes the magic essence can be obtained much easier now. So the conversion rate for gemstones should have been much higher than 1 for 10 and gemstone skins should cost more. Otherwise all the money people spent to obtain gemstones has been massively devalued. Like the bundles that were 5000 plus riot points that you know people purchased just because it was a guaranteed gemstone drop. Those are pointless expenses now. They devalued gemstone skins massively. 

Using this value for time/effort calculation.. 13 gemstones = 10 prestige skins. Prestige skins cost about 125 each now so (10 x 125) ÷ 13 = a gemstone should have been worth 96 mythic essence and a former gemstone skin should cost 960me.

By not doing it this way everyone that spent loads of money buying bundles for varying costs of riot points to bypass waiting forever for RNG wasted their money. The goal was to get a rare skin that very few people had and now they are the cheapest skins in the game. You can get 5 of them for every 4 events instead of 1 every 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Due to making prestige skins cost more than gemstone skins used to... And by not giving a fair conversion value of gemstones per Mythic essence... Gemstone/Hextech skins went from the hardest to obtain to the easiest to obtain overnight completely devaluing them by making all the effort and money that went into getting them a massive waste.",4

Loot was Just introduced when i jumped off, and I know It was subjected to several changes in time, but I could not undestrand how game breaking was for someone Who loves in game content.
I could not spend real currency to get the skins I love beccause my economic condition shifted throughout these years, so I decided to test how many skins I could obtain with a little experiment; without spending a single penny, I kept track of all the possible methods to obtain free in game content, including loot, a prime gaming account borrowed from a friend Who doesn't play League and events (like Arcane Capsules and Event Missions). I'm still looking for other ways, right now trying to leverage Buff and Microsoft Rewards mechanism, but the final result with some re-roll optimization and luck Is the following:

• Dark Star Kha Zix (1350 RP)
• Dark Cosmic Lux (1820 RP)
• Sentinel Olaf (1350 RP)
• Astronautilus (1350 RP)
• Sentinel Irelia (1350 RP)
• Galaxy Slayer Zed (1820 RP)
• Waterloo Miss Fortune (520 RP)
• Gun Goddess Miss Fortune (2775 RP)
• Elderwood Azir (1350 RP)

• Arcane Caitlyn (975 RP)
• Arcane Jayce (975 RP)
• Arcane Vi (975 RP)
• Project: Mordekaiser (1820 RP)
• Warden Gragas (1350 RP)
• Battlecast Urgot (1350 RP)
• Bee' Maw (1350 RP)
• Project: Jhin (1350 RP)
• Championship Ryze (1350 RP)
• Omega Squad Tristana (1350 RP)
• Unused Prime RP (2150 RP)

The total amount of obtained value sits around 31.000 RP, which is roughly 250$; this value does not also take in account other side elements such as Chroma bought with Essence Emporium, unclaimed Skins/Skin Shards in the loot, Wards and Emotes. 
Overall my general idea is that the system Is overall underappreciated, and despite any criticism that can be directed toward Riot, it's undeniable that the free content they provide for a free game is overwhelming compared to other games; sometimes is worth to Just sit and appreciate what this game and its team provides without asking anything back, in a word where corporate mindset pollutes most of the stuff we enjoy.",4

This post is based on plat+elo Korean server, about the champions on the rise after patch 12.6  

 Since the data is collected for three days after the patch, the number of samples may be slightly be insufficient and the values may vary.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Talon**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/91/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/91/statistics/)

Talon Jungle seemed to disappear into the history as the additional damage to monsters disappeared with the last 12.2 patch.  


[Talons patch history, Talon's w Additional damage nurfed to 105&amp;#37; ](https://preview.redd.it/psub64fgzfr81.png?width=715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca5f7abf1e0c28bb8e96b4238328ab9d9d8e8834)

However, Talon jungle is emerging again. And the 12.6 patch has boosted talon's rise.  
Currently, the winning rate is 52.3% and the pick rate is 3.4%, up 1.2%p from the last patch.  
The biggest reason is that there is a huge nerf on hecarim and  over time, Talon jungle players' adapted to talon's early jungle camps may have affected to the rise.  
Talon's E-skill has a high value of mobility. However, the Talon jungle shows a trend that the merit decreases as the tier goes up.  
In the master or higher elo, win rate was 46.6% and the pick rate was 5.9%, which is clearly higher than before, but its not   
recommendable.  
In high elo, players often take advantage of opponent's slow camp clearing by invading and early engagements.  


[JG talon's expected winrate graph](https://preview.redd.it/y3pfwcre4gr81.png?width=229&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e65e82dc45e329c034fc1fa30248c596c88621)

In fact, the predicted winning percentage graph of Jungle Talon shows an upward right graph with a fairly large slope. Therefore, it would be desirable to pick talon after the opponent jungler is picked and I recommend that you match with the mid-champion that will compensate for your initial weakness.  
As long as talon makes up for his disadvantage in early jungle phase, he must still be an active jungler.

&amp;#x200B;

 **9. Camille**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/164/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/164/statistics/)

https://preview.redd.it/5oa7j3wwugr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32d5f365859688b3951aed384b8d13fb1572c93a

In this patch, there were many changes to the champion centered on the upper lanes, and among them, TOP's ecosystem is in the midst of reorganizing.  
In the meantime, Camille shows a rise in relative value. The winning rate has risen 1.4%p compared to the last patch, making a pleasant start.  
The biggest reason is the nerf of tryndamere. Originally, if the donminating champion of any line is nerfed hard, the champions right under that will benefit from it.  
Among them, Camille, in particular, when there is no exceptionally strong champion at the top, the difficulty of the line game is eased, and the index rises as the frequency of exerting influence in the late game increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Camille prediction multiplier graph 12.5b\(L\) 12.6\(R\)](https://preview.redd.it/e98tvnxm6gr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af7e84821b426235d0e09d8b1024ecc99c3975d6)

In fact, Camille's win rate graph shows that the low point of the 10-15 minute interval has risen compared to the last patch, and the high point comes a little faster after 25 minutes.  
However, it seems difficult to reach the first tier because other champions are on the rise in the current top ecosystem. 

**8. Gangplank**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/41/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/41/statistics/)

Gangplank has been showing promising results quietly. However, thanks to the reorganization of the tower ecosystem, he is showing better results.  
Gangplank succeeded to be tier 1 champ with a win rate of 51.1% and a pick rate of 6.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tough Matchup of Gangplank\(12.5b\)](https://preview.redd.it/pfp3tykf7gr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92cc44f8a4d4d86cbf0a03fd46187871fe7e3f01)

 It can be taken for granted that Tryndamere, most difficult to deal with previous patches, is on the decline. 

&amp;#x200B;

 What's interesting is that the gangplank, hullbreaker as 2nd core and focusing on the side lane is showing positive data. Currently, the pickrate is over 20% and win rate is 56.59, Which shows far more advantageous data over other 2nd core items.

 

[ Gangplank win rate prediction graph \(12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/wzn8r9fr8gr81.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8f27ccb915dd5d129ec259eeca5db77fe0776eb)

Contrary to popular perception, the current solo rank-based gangplank is a snowball champion who has to continue it's benefits of the line match.

It is true that gangplank is strong after level 13, but the difficulty is too high, and blasting his barrels in team fights are hard.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Gangplank Spell Data ](https://preview.redd.it/ayb17p05agr81.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508c6d3d3e73c27918b76577720da05802d64f65)

As a result, the win rate of the gangplank focused on the line is significantly higher by using the ignite. This kind of play has enough merit, and based on skilled players, gangplank can exert both line and second half influence.  
Obviously its a difficult champion, but it's worth practicing. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **7. Zeri**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/221/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/221/statistics/)

What is the limit of this champion? The last patch was a huge nerf for Zeri and she showed a huge decline.  
However, the current data after 12.6 patch shows Zeri is one of usable main adc.   
Currently, the win rate is 50.3%, pick rate of 11.2%, and ban rate of 23.1%, recording the highest data among second tier adcs.

&amp;#x200B;

[Easy matchup of Zeri \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/ip46ms4gbgr81.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=738aef0819498b88aeeea4419949964f901439e9)

 t is believed that Zeri's rise is driven by his superiority over Samira, Kaisa and Jaya, who have frequently appeared recently.  
Basically, Zeri has a long range thanks to her Q skills. Therefore, she has an advantageous structure against a champion who has shorter range than her and has no means of checking the line match.  
Kaisa, Samira, and even zhaya are all uncomfortable against champions with long ranges.  
The combined pick rate of the three adc is close to 45 percent, so the current Zeri index seems to be possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[hard matchup of Zeri \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/2wih0vjbdgr81.png?width=456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e8dbe230a3f5613a53bcf65c889967279d81c9)

It is difficult to withstand the early lane match against MF, Draven, TRistana, Jhin, and Lucian, stronger adcs in lane compared to Zeri.  
Therefore, Picking Zeri after opponent ADC  is a way to make full use of her.  
It clearly shows that the carrying power in the late game, such as the overwhelming range of Q skills and the movement speed of the ultimate is great as long as lane phase is smooth.  
It's amazing to see her performing well again after so many nerfs. 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Azir**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/268/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/268/statistics/)

Azir received a very good buff patch. My growth health increased by 13, and final base health in level 18 increased by 211.  
For Azir, who has to be close to deal full damage did benefit alot with health buff.  
Currently, the win rate is 50.5% and the pick rate is 2.3%. It is quite encouraging that Azir, considering its famous for champion difficulties.  
In the master+ elo, the win rate was 53.6% and the pick rate was 2.2%, showing even better indicators.  
This data is for solo rank, but we should pay more attention to Azir when this patch version is applied to pro stages.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Darius**

[https://lol.ps/en/champ/122/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/122/statistics/)

Darius now has a win rate of 52.4 percent and a pick rate of 8.4 percent. This is the one fo the highest indicators in top lane.  
The buff of the ultimate was not small, Darius, which was originally powerful, is more lethal.  
Not only that, Top lane dominator Tryndamere is nerfed pretty badly by this patch, aiding darius to trend.  
What's interesting is that unlike the perceptions that darius is strong in a low tier, he has a win rate of 53.6% in the diamond+ elo and a win rate of 54% in the master+ elo, recording a higher win rates as the tier rises.  
The win rate is 51% in the Bronze\~gold section, recording the one of the highest win rates in all sections.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Darius 1-core data ](https://preview.redd.it/jcerb40engr81.png?width=312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5fa38369c464a0a39793e0dd1613631e47ace24)

As the darius' lane dominance has risen, the index of the Trinity Force records the highest, and it is also possible to use the stride breaker and hull breaker according to the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Darius 3-core combination data ](https://preview.redd.it/088fxr9rngr81.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f97f5f7a6e689d47c4cd8d1693d17959e189755)

It has shown that darius is best with typical bruiser items death's dance and sterak's or death's dance and Malmortius

In particular, Darius has the highest growth attack power in the rift with a growth attack of 5, so please note that the efficiency of the sterak as a third core item is quite good. 

&amp;#x200B;

[hard matchup of Darius \(patch 12.6\)](https://preview.redd.it/j4bcgszaogr81.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a6d81410ff8a06cf6b0437f3aec0870b21a668)

There is definitely a disadvantage against long-distance champions such as Vayne and Kayle, but it is undeniable that darius is one of the best top champions at this point, and their influence doubles if selected after your top opponent.

Darius,which every top laner must have tried at least once, is no longer a choice, but must play champion.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Rengar**

[**https://lol.ps/en/champ/107/statistics/**](https://lol.ps/en/champ/107/statistics/)

https://preview.redd.it/kbm2vhwjxgr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b05a2d6598ee0b2f97908e882cf7a161f0aa5fd1

Rengar has received a wide variety of convenience patches. When taking a leap, it not only eased wild stack standards, but also lowered the difficulty of in-play, such as maintaining the stack and providing a view around E and the ultimate device, as well as increased the overall diversity of play.

On top of that, without any adjustment to the Q skill, the empowered Q skill can now be critically hit + additional damage proportional to the critical hit probability, so the index had to rise.

Currently, it has a win rate of 51.4% and a pick rate of 5.1%, including himself in the 2nd tier. Rengar's play is so unique that it's a huge rise considering that he was a champion only skilled users played.

The pick rate has also increased considerably.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Rengar's 1st-Core item Data ](https://preview.redd.it/tdqvxfrmpgr81.png?width=310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f17e6f5b874f5f3ce73e2d8e60fe452d7015f80a)

Although it is still difficult to give a clear answer due to the lack of samples, a build that uses Immortal Shieldbow as one core shows the possibility of research.  
Based on Immortal Shieldbow, it is a build that utilizes items based on fatal hits such as essence reaver - the collector.  
Research on Rengar is expected to continue in the future, and will share it again when the mainstream build is established. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **3. Jax**  
[https://lol.ps/en/champ/24/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/24/statistics/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1uoer11oxgr81.png?width=120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4531948d287d1d34802b368c248082addc3bf80

Jax currently has a win rate of 50.6 percent and a pick rate of 7.7 percent. In addition to the rise in the basic damage of the w, it is showing the proper efficacy of the buff that received basic physical strength buff.

  
In particular, Jax's performance increases as the tier rises. In the master+ elo, the winning rate was 53.8% and the pick rate was 10.7%, showing monster-like data. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Jax's predicted win percentage graph 12.5b\(L\) 12.6\(R\)](https://preview.redd.it/bxktbyxjqgr81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e9238f6f5b02632cee71580786c1665f0f14f5)

 In addition, there is no significant change in the shape of the predicted winning rate graph, but the winning rate in the pre-line stage has risen from the early 49% range to close to 50%, making the low point a little higher.  
Now, instead of showing ambiguity in the line match, he has transformed himself into an insurance-like champion with guaranteed carrying power in the late game. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ 12.6 Patch Jax' 3-core item build data ](https://preview.redd.it/f4jqlilhrgr81.png?width=308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc72db3687997a21dcc1e66a0f755415b98ece9)

Blade of ruined king, trinity force, and death's dance three core combination is the most selected and best performing build. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Lucian**  
[https://lol.ps/en/champ/236/statistics/](https://lol.ps/en/champ/236/statistics/)

Unexpected Lucian ranks second in the ranking of champions benefited by 12.6 patch. In fact, Lucian's rise did not start out of nowhere.  
It just happened right after the 12.5b patch, as users who did not immediately realize Lucian's power started to play him. 

Lucian's pick rate has risen from 18% to 22.9% now, and the average winning rate has been on the rise, recording 53.2%. Even the ban rate has risen sharply to the top among adcs, achieving the 22% ban rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8drtn0obtgr81.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27c6d568e89bd6a8cce719f921051694e7938484

Based on the current data, there is hard matchup except for Ash and Tristana.

lucian a typical Solo-Rank strong winning rate graph with a winning rate of 53 percent in 15 minutes.  
So much so that Lucian's destructive power now is beyond imagination. If you are a one-deal user, I recommend that you use Lucian more actively. 

**1. Nidalee**

[**https://lol.ps/en/champ/76/statistics/**](https://lol.ps/en/champ/76/statistics/)

Nidalee is ranked first in list of champions that benefited this patch. Let's take a look at the data first. Nidalee has a winning rate of 50.7% and a pick rate of 15.8%, showing one of the top indicators of the jungle. 

It is hard to believe that win rate has risen by 5% with 6.6% higher pick rate. 

This is because proficiency must be supported in order to make full use of Nidalee.  
Recent buff of Nidalee was not small, and Hecarim, who ruled in the jungle until the last patch, fell into the abyss in an instant.  
Naturally, the higher the tier, the better Nidali's index is, and it shows a monstrous data of 52.7% win rate, 22.6% pick rate, and 42% ban rate in the master+ elo.  
Recently, the AP jungle champion has been weak, but she changed it at once. If this happens, the mid- and top champion picks will also be affected.  
We need to carefully observe how Nidalee's rise will change other lines.",4

2117,leagueoflegends,"Every game recently I've seen hullbreaker.  Either a Sion, or a Trundle, or a Yorick or even Trynd- and its always the same thing, no matter how much you try to put them behind, they will eventually just end the game by splitting because your team can't do two things at once.   I've lost so many games recently just due to hullbreaker- even when the person using it is massively behind.  We had a yasuo doing it one game and he still managed to 1v3 people in a lane alone due to the tankiness, and once an inhib goes down, its just a spiral into defeat unless we just force an end, which nearly never happens in norms.   It feels like a plague, and I'm not sure what to do about it when I see it.   


Just last game I was suuuper fed on ezreal, but it didn't matter- because the whole team had to be on the guy with hullbreaker, or I had to, and then it was either me trying to 1v4 or the team being unable to fight theirs while I dealt with the yorick using hullbreaker.   And I see it a lot when I'm not the one ahead, too- you just need a level of coordination to deal with it that random groups of people aren't going to have.   


Anyone know a good way or some champion that is great at dealing with this without resorting to it their self?  And I can't go to ranked, because I play with 1-2 friends, and duo is going away soon so even duo ranked isn't really an option to avoid norms. :/

2118,leagueoflegends,"As of now, there are 159 champions in league, and riot is going to be releasing another void jungler soon which I am somewhat excited for, but I'm sitting here wondering why riot is spewing out so many champs so frequently? 

Not too long ago we got lillia, rell, and gwen and they all have seemingly fallen out of relevancy not too long after they came, with no real work seeming to be made to bring them back into popularity. Same can be said for a lot of older champions too, like skarner(rework in like 2+ years, lol), kog, ivern, olaf, and taric to list a few that sit at sub 1% pick rates on average. 

Shouldn't there be a more active effort to just work on these champions (and items) and get them back up to speed for new and old players alike to have more of a reason to play them? After releasing so many, new additions nowadays just feel like another drop in the bucket rather than something special, and seem to be putting LoL into a race to burn itself out of ideas. 

In my honest opinion, ASU's and VGU's are the way to go from now on, and should receive the central focus rather than pumping out champs seemingly after every other month that is time after time causing issues for the game and causing frustration.",4

2124,leagueoflegends,"For the longest time, top has been an island and jungler a have no reason to come top for the following 3 reasons:

(1) herald isn’t as valuable as dragon

(2) dragon is bot

(3) bot has 2 champions, so you effectively get 2 champs ahead by camping bot instead of just 1 champ by camping top (not to mention there is more champion kill gold to be made bot).


So, what if drag and baron swapped locations? Namely, drag is top and baron is bot.

This could potentially give junglers a legitimate reason to actually come top lane since there is a valuable objective. But, bot wouldn’t become an island as the incentive of possibly getting 2 champions ahead still exists. Therefore, the play around either lane would become more balanced, and thus the game would become far more interesting. What do you guys think?",4

p- gains more armor and mr the closer he is to terrain

q- he charges up a skill shot, releasable at any time; at full charge if the projectile hits terrain it creates an aoe blast, if terrain is champ made it destroys the terrain and the blast is bigger and knocks back enemies a short distance

w- passive: abilities cast in his vision range that are obscured (ie behind walls or bushes) show a visual cue to him (doesn't show on the map or anything)

active: he releases a short range pulse that  damages nearby enemies and reveals them for a few seconds

e- he does a dashes a fixed distance. upon collision with terrain he latches on and can recast his e again, this time dragging temporary terrain with him on his dash

r- he tosses stones to a target location, knocking down  and damaging enemies and becoming temporary terrain where they land (not a single piece but like 3- 6 stones of temporary terrain) (not like Xerath ult, but more a set formation like Taliyah's mines)

2138,leagueoflegends,"Ive been playing a lot of volibear and shyvana recently and they are both really versatile champions, and with that comes a lot of options for itens and runes.

**Passive: Guerilla Warfare**

If Teemo stands still for 1 second, he becomes stealthed. If walking into the brush, he will stealth immediately even if he is moving or taking damage.

If Teemo exits stealth (either by leaving brush or by moving) he performs a dodge roll and gains a large attack speed buff, and move speed while running away from enemy champions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Blinding Dart**

Teemo fires a direct in a line, hitting the first champion it meets dealing magic damage and blinding them.

If Teemo is stealthed, the damage inflicted is increased and the blind lasts longer.

&amp;#x200B;

**W: Sprint**

*Passive: Teemo gains % bonus movement speed. This bonus is doubled while running away from enemy champions.*

Active: Teemo performs a dodge roll, gaining movement speed and attack speed.

If Teemo enters stealth, the cool down on this ability is refreshed.

&amp;#x200B;

**E: Toxic Shot**

*Passive: Teemo's basic attacks deal additional magic damage on hit and over time.*

Active: (Can only be cast while stealthed) Teemo blows a silent yet toxic dart to target enemy, dealing damage and poisoning them. This ability does not reveal Teemo.

&amp;#x200B;

**R: Noxious Trap**

*Passive: Each time Teemo dodge rolls, he leaves behind a mushroom that arms faster than usual. Additionally if Teemo dies, he also explodes like a mushroom.*

Active: Basically the same as live, except placing a mushroom does not reveal him.",4

2145,leagueoflegends,"I'm considering buying tickets as I live in texas, but they are pretty dang expensive compared to past lcs events. Just wondering if its literally just go sit down and watch them game or if there are other things like vendors, or meet and greets or other things?

If anyone has been before, can they clue me in? Can't find any solid info online, and am hesitant to drop my hard earned cash. Also even tho I'm in texas its still a 6 hour drive :( big state problems",4

2147,leagueoflegends,Recap of what actually happened on April 1st in blind pick.,4
2148,leagueoflegends,"Was talking to my buddies and we are all having issues most games because we all want to play a role someone else wants to and only knows how to play. I said we needed a new lane/area on the rift and it pretty much goes like this, and before yall read, just know I made it up on the spot and am expecting some bad comments about my far fetched idea and I am all for suggestions and even criticism. 

&amp;#x200B;

This new area would be the void, quite literally. 

You are instantly banished there at beginning of the game if it's the role you got. Thing is, no one knows who will be subjected to the void. The goal is to survive there and rack up as much gold as possible. Monsters will be such like the jungle creeps, except there is a few new creeps that actually roam and look for you. The void is essentially dark, obviously, so your vision would be like nocturnes ult, just permanent until you are out and back on the rift. The creeps that roam would have more vision than you and they know their way around the voided area. They aren't as powerful and health as dragon or rift, but much more stronger than regular creep camps but killing them, if you can is much more rewarding with gold and health and buffs. There are only 2 ways back to the rift. Either kill ALL of the new special void creeps and get so many stacks or points which would be a new idea implemented, or, your team has to get aced 3 times to the point the game is like ""Alright, you're up buddy""

&amp;#x200B;

That was my idea. I just randomly made it up on the spot but it would be pretty cool to see something like this in league just to make things harder and worse. Nothing like being tilted, going into a new game hoping for something more promising and BAM! Banished to the void. Or, people who get too many reports from recent games gets pushed right into it just because.",4
2149,leagueoflegends,I was just wondering how to get the 2200 tokens necessary for the mythic essence.  I have 1200 token but no more challenge left (other than the infinity one). IS there going to more challenges or I just need to play like 500 games?,4
2150,leagueoflegends,How did you hit? Yes,4
2151,leagueoflegends,"the whole system is just kind of bad. theres 5 roles but you can only pick two. its either two or all of them. you cant just pick three or four so your pigeon holed into playing less than half the roles, but youll almost certainly get autofilled into the one role you dont want or cant play. 

youre limited to you can play with because god forbid one of your friends plays the same two roles you do. why cant you queue with someone who also plays top mid for example? one person gets top, the other person either defaults to mid or gets autofilled or whatever needs to happen. 

we had FOUR people in our lobby and we couldnt queue because two of us play mid and top. FOUR PEOPLE. and it kept us from queueing. 

i like being able to choose my role. i remember what it was like back in the day being last hit and praying you werent getting the roles you hate. but just because its better doesent mean its perfect and its far from perfect.

 i think being able to at least have the option to pick a third, it doesent have to be mandatory, it would be so much better. if you like more than two roles youre not stuck trying to juggle between the three of them. i imagine it would also alleviate autofill woes because thats an entire other role you can fill into before it starts autofilling you. 

maybe thats not the solution, but i just dont think the way it is, is where it should stay. i feel like it could just be better, and why not make it better?",4
2152,leagueoflegends,"So how do the upgrades work? I know i need to finish all 15 milestones in a set, but will i get both the vertical line things or just one. I'm about to finish a series 1, however I'm not sure if I'll have both the lines.",4

2154,leagueoflegends,"I've returned to league after a 2 or 3 year break and the new attack move left click option has my old keybindings all mucked up.

I use a Razer Naga mouse, the one with 12 buttons of the left side of the mouse and years back, I could use the number 1 as my left mouse click just fine.

The problem is that now with the in-client option to use attack move left click, you cannot just left click things like the minimap. You now have to hold shift and then click to select things.

Is there a way to undo this?

I've tried to rebind some of these things in client, but it won't flat out let me bind my left mouse click to things.

P: you can’t purchase wards and only trinket that you can use is an oracle lense but it has a shorter cooldown


Q: slow medium range skillshot that pierces minions and slows any enemies that it hits


W: buff an allied champion by increasing their vision range 


E:you emit an aura that disables(but does not reveal) all wards within it(toggle)

2165,leagueoflegends,"shaco is a bootleg version of a dollar store joker. he has no original personality. he only says joker quotes. hell even his name is a spin off of joker (because hes an anagram of chaos and joker at a surface level is about chaos). 

any sort of change to his lore would be an improvement at this point. riot writes good lore most of the time. decent expectations for his lore update.",4
2166,leagueoflegends,"What's up with picking sion and dying 3-4 times within 5 minutes but as soon as he gets hullbreaker he can solo 2-3 players without taking any damage. 

All this while destroying top lane with a score of 2-7. 

Your top laner cant hold him back. You need to send 1 or two people up to even stop him. Meanwhile you lose the rest of the map due to that pressure.

You dont have to be a good player to abuse this strategy top. There is little skill or decision making involved. These players typically just die all the time but still accomplish everything that needs to be done a) farm b) push tower 3) draw 2-3 players.

Every time I start red they steal my blue if I start blue they steal my red if I take too long doing the jungle I lose the crabs and they keep typing ""JG diff"" I don't even know what that means anyway I always get lost and if I ask my team for help they type JG noob or type that they have already lost the match I really feel bad Why does it seem that no matter how hard I try I will star against a global top 1 in the enemy jungle stealing everything and always being in the right place at the right time I feel mega frustrated knowing that everything in the game depends on me and that I don't have any prerequisites for this route

2169,leagueoflegends,"I've seen some posts about them reworking the token system to count per time and not per game. Thus previous ""calculations"" that I've seen aren't applicable.

Is it feasible to get the ME and the prestige skin? I feel like I've already burned through all of the quests (I know there is 750 left from 3 event pass weeklies), and with just the 10tokens / 200 ""points"", it's going to be quite a grind? 

Since it's my first time getting the pass I was wondering what experiences other members have had with this. How many tokens have you accrued in previous events? 

And if &gt;4000 tokens is possible, can you get the ME multiple times? I hate the ""battle anime"" skins, and if I could get the ME for some previous prestige skins, that would be ideal.

2171,leagueoflegends,"The change of Renga Q´ s interaction with crit shows us again that we finally need to change Critical chance away from the random chance and towards a normal amplifier.   


Introducing Auto attack amplifier or AAA in short  
The new AAA will change crit so that youre if you have 20% AAA youre auto attack deal 20% more damage this goes up to 100% bonus dmg to a total of 200% dmg. While this is more than the normal 175% we have right now it also comes with a change to infinity edge to make it not necessary to build when you go crit.  


Overall this change would make crit more consistent without breaking it as on avg it would deal the exact same dmg but on lower Crit values you dont need to gamble as much as having luck and Crit with the first 2 aa in a battle or 2 waves of MF ult or hitting the barrel can complete change how a fight goes and it is amplified more with the extremely high dmg we have in the game right now.  


With this there is no random dmg spike for Crit users in a fight and since everyone knows exactly how much dmg they deal it comes down to Skill complettly. 

This also opens Crit users to build other items chance to not crit in the most important time while allowing non crit user to get a crit item without needing to focus on more.

Thank you for reading down below this point i will list all items and abilites that work with crit and how you can easily change it 

# Items

Rageblade  
Instead of  Convert crit to onhit dmg it now states AAA now increases Onhit effects instead of AA  


Infinity Edge  
The only idea i have is make it passive less and have 70AD and 40%AAA  


Naovies  
Changes to Attacks now reduce basic ability cooldown by 0-20% based on AAA

# Champions

Most Abilities that can crit now just scale with AAA some special cases are listed below

Yas and Yone Passive  
Still works the same with multiplying AAA by 2.5 but AAA only boost Attacks by 6% per 10% AAA.  
Yas ult  
Bonus armor pen now scales with AAA (5% per 10% AAA)  
Jhin  
4Th shot always 100% AAA. and Attacks grant Jhin  10% (+ 0.4% per 1% **bonus** as) \* 0,01 AAA **bonus** movement speed for 2 seconds.   
Ashe  
Still works the same but frost slow Strenght now scales with AAA.  
Aphelios  
Infernum now gains a flame for every 40% AAA  
Graves  
Attacks now gain a bullet for every 40% AAA  
Tryndamer

Maybe I just had bad experiences with Jannas (i dont even play ADC very often) but every single time if they are losing, they are the biggest trashtalker as well as the usual ""gg ez"" spammers in post game lobby.

2179,leagueoflegends," 

Hey, my name is Splaxx and over the last few years I've been trying to build a gaming/esports community.

As you might have read from the title, this is my last attempt. I put too much money, time and love into such projects. I simply can't afford to fail again.

I've been working for weeks on logos, intros, potential sponsors and the Discord server itself and now I'm ready to present it.

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to Team Clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

Team Clarity is supposed to be a gaming/eSports community.

A relaxed round with people you meet on the server up to professional esport league games. I want to have everything. Full program. Everyone can join of course. Be it origin, gender or age. It doesn't matter. Gaming is for everyone.

I am still looking for an entire team. From supporters to admins every position is still available.

So if you are interested in starting something big, just join the Discord server.

[https://discord.gg/zndtjbYCME](https://discord.gg/zndtjbYCME)

Thank you for your time &amp; hopefully I could gain your interest.",4

League obviously isn't like MMOs but often times in games like WoW if you are a level 11 and you kill say a level 14, you will get more XP than if you kill a level 11. Do you think this concept should apply to mobas like league. Its in there for XP gains, but what about gold gains, earning more than 300G if the level diff is large for example

As an ADC main, when an enemy top laners snowballs off of solo kills, it can get extreme enough where he/she is 4 sometimes 5 levels ahead of me, making it almost impossible for me to kill that person, so I think it would be rewarding if there were level based bounties.

2207,leagueoflegends,"I've been wondering for a long time about this item. Does it make sense for it to be the second highest ap damage in the game right below Rabadon's?

I mean the item is designed for AP autoattackers, you deal extra damage per auto, so as long as you're constantly autoattacking, the item has no downtime, it applies its effect consistently and based on it's design one would assume it's a dps item and not a burst one.

There are champs like Diana and Shyvana who benefit from the attack speed this item grants but at the end of the day, both of those end up just bursting people down, especially Shyvanna since she builds the item and most of the time doesnt even auto champions with it.

So what do you think? Is it fair for a mainly dps item to give 25 more ap than Lich Bane for example which is actually a burst item?",4
2208,leagueoflegends,"are there any difference if I buy it straight away vs wait for the tokens to stash up? i dont quite understand the rewards written in the pass, like mythic essenxe and stuff, do you get it when you buy the pass, or is it bound to missions you get after?",4
2209,leagueoflegends,"I'm writing this as I was in a fight with a wooden head like 15 minutes ago. He was salty because he is being stuck in Silver (because he only gets the bad team). I went into his match history and what did I found...my guy plays about 2 games per day on average. Yes his stats are usually way better than the rest of his team but with they amount of games he plays I don't see the point in complaining.  It does not matter how good you (think) you are. If you don't have the dedication atleast for a week or two ...you ain't climbing. Unless you are a GM smurf in bronze. But that's besides the point.   
I know the guy for a while now and I know he can carry 1v9-ers easily. But nevertheless nobody can pull that off consistently in such few games or at all. This is why we expereince highs and lows in climbing.   
To sum things up. I just want to say to those people who blame their teams for not being able to climb. Get on yo butt and play more. Things will come and you will get to your deserved place eventually.

It's made worse on certain champions, namely ones like Riven Aatrox and Viego, and that's coming from someone who's two main champs are Riven and Aatrox. It's unfair, and the item makes the champs who can use it well way too tanky and also heal way too much.",4

2214,leagueoflegends,"I've been thinking about this for awhile, and I guess I finally seen this item enough to put all my thoughts and breakdowns of this thing online for everyone to flame me over. Prepare yourself, this is a really long analysis:

TL;DR: Hullbreaker as it exists is way too efficient without enough drawbacks, and leaves extremely little room for interactivity. Especially when compared to previously removed items that had half the strength but were still too 'meta-warping' to remain in League.

&amp;#x200B;

***Hullbreaker is bad for League of Legends and the arguments that it isn't are weak.***

Hullbreaker has been out for nearly a year now. In that time, it received two buffs increasing its base stats, and recently a nerf that affects ranged champions abilities to utilize it's passive resistances.

This item costs 2,800 gold, but gives roughly 3360 gold worth of base stats. This on its own is definitely an outlier compared to pretty much everything else, but that's *before* you count the stats that the passive gives. When adding the passive resistances (armor being worth 1200g and MR 1080, the amount of stats this item gives you comes out to 5,640g worth.

5,640g in stats for a legendary item that costs 2,800g. That's *200% gold efficient*.

This 200% gold efficiency is calculated BEFORE you start to add in the things that are difficult to quantify with a gold value:

* Gives the wielder +20% damage to towers (important to note that this affects demolish). When fighting turrets, this bonus in damage could easily be worth a few thousand gold by giving the same damage that bonus AD would give.
* Nearby siege minions gain up to 180 armor and 90 MR, as well as deal 200% damage to turrets. Difficult to quantify how valuable this since it isn't going on a champ, but gives the siege minion that equivalent of 12 cloth armors (3,600g) and roughly 3 null magic mantles worth of MR (1,350g)

Without adding in the value of push power your minions receive, all of the bonuses this item offers can come out to the 7000g-8000g range when hitting a tower, and between 11,000g-12,000g if you count the bonus resistances added to units around you, WITHOUT calculating in the value of their 200% bonus damage or finding some way to calculate the inherent value of siege minions tanking the tower for significantly longer during a push.

All of this combined into a single, 2,800g, non-mythic item slot is absolutely absurd. It is unhealthy and not interactive for the enemy team for multiple reasons:

During lane:

1. The moment someone returns to lane with a Hullbreaker against someone that can't itemize that, they immediately can no longer be pushed in on cannon waves in nearly all circumstances. This leaves the person without Hullbreaker in a position where no matter what, they will need to take bad recalls and fall behind in gold/xp. This item nullifies the enemy's ability to utilize fundamental aspects of League to stay even/secure a lead.
2. Hullbreaker is a stat-check item on majority of champs that use it. Not only do they lose control of the ability to wave control due to the difference in minion stats, but now a Hullbreaker wielder is free to basically do whatever they want. They take much less damage due to passive resistances, they care a lot less because they have that big health pool to oppress the enemy with, and they almost certainly do more damage because of the AD to top all that off. This item nullifies the need to play well in most cases. You have so many stats now, you can usually just run at your opponent and take every single trade and never lose. The 150% base health regen provided by Hullbreaker only makes these trades even more free.
3. Hullbreaker inadvertently ends in getting most if not all tower plates at a rate the opponent can not hope to. Add this to the way Hullbreaker forces the enemy to take bad recalls and you have a guaranteed snowball early, and without much effort.

Outside of lane:

1. All the way to level 18 this item keeps getting better and better. The longer the game goes on the more stats this item provides, and the more insane the minion buff passive is since siege minions scale infinitely into the late game.
2. A champ that has Hullbreaker nearly always HAS to be addressed by 2 or 3 of the strongest members of the enemy team (if they want to keep their towers). This level of pressure from one item creates huge windows for your team to do every other objective on the map.

&amp;#x200B;

**Counter argument time:**

* **""But Soulless, the only reason Hullbreaker is so good is because best bruiser item got nerfed!1!! (Sterak's Gage).""**

Sterak's and Hullbreaker have both always been strong, with the key difference being that no one figured out how good Hullbreaker was until after Sterak's got its nerf. It is not uncommon for an item to get added/reworked and have it's potential go unnoticed for a while since everyone is already so used to the meta being other things. Sterak's was just doing then what Hullbreaker is used for now: smothering your opponent with stats.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""**Cmon man, Hullbreaker is okay because the trade off is that you can't have teammates nearby and still get the max out of the push power!!""**

....really? If you're saying this you're missing the point of what makes this item so toxic in the first place. Have you ever seen a Hullbreaker Illaoi/Sion/Tryndamere/Yorick care they are just running it down lanes alone? A single player with this item exerts so much pressure by themselves, that's literally all they want to happen in the first place. Hullbreaker gamers want two things: tons of free gold/xp for themselves and tons of free objectives elsewhere while the enemy team sends multiple people to deal with the push. Outside of a few truly terrible inting Sions, I've never seen someone brainlessly running down sidelanes with a Hullbreaker by themselves be worse than the alternatives. The strat is just too good and too noninteractive for the opposition. Lose by not dealing with it or lose by dealing with it.

ALSO, even when grouped with teammates, this item is still roughly 120% gold efficient. You've still got a great item without all the insane stats the passive gives.

&amp;#x200B;

* **""Every bruiser item got nerfed hard, Hullbreaker is the only good buy for us now!!""**

Kind of like the first argument, but I feel it's separate enough.

Wow, the bruiser items got nerfed huh? Wonder why that is. So now, in order to deal damage top laners must commit to damage items/less tank, and to be tanky they have to commit to tank items/less damage? Hullbreaker is the only option left to freely oppress everyone else by doing both? That's called itemization, and it actually applies to all the other roles/playstyles. No one is sorry you can't build the same cookie cutter items every game and be impossible to kill while also dealing the most damage at the same time. No one cares Hullbreaker is the only option left to chase that high. Dealing with that is not fun for anyone else and exactly why Hullbreaker needs to be changed. The item creates an unfun, uninteractive experience for literally everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taking a look at League's past:**

Anyone here old enough to remember Banner of Command? I know, I know, time to go to bed grandpa. Riot removed that item because it was toxic to the state of the game: it was either niche and no one bought it or it was meta-warping. Sound familiar? It does to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**What did Banner of Command do?**

125% base health regeneration

60 Armor

30 Magic Resist

Active: Promote\*\*:\*\* Greatly increases the power of a lane minion, granting it 40% reduced damage from enemy champions, 100% **bonus** damage against turrets and bonus stats (some health and up to 100 armor, melee/caster minions get attack speed). (90 second CD)

Passive: P**oint Runner:** Builds up to 20% **bonus** movement speed over 2 seconds while near turrets, fallen turrets or Void Gates.

That's.... pretty underwhelming when compared to Hullbreaker. Every 3rd wave you got to give a minion of your choice half the stats that Hullbreaker currently does, and make it a little harder to kill for champs with the 40% damage reduction. But THAT was meta-warping enough to get removed.

Am I the only one seeing the similarities and differences here? I will admit that being able to get a 5 man banner on a wave was strong the one patch that people were doing that, but even then they had to commit as a team to that strategy and all waste an item slot they certainly could have used on anything better. So it kind of came out even. Hullbreaker gives minions double what BoC used to while also making the champion it's on obnoxiously strong at all stages of the game.

I'm sure there will be much more anger at this post/'well ackchually' in the comments than there will be those that sympathize but whatever. This item is unfun to play against at best, and completely game ruining at worst. Really wish Riot would take a look at the systems at play here and make adjustments.",4
2215,leagueoflegends,"I am a player that often takes longer breaks from the game. This is why I sometimes make my placements later in the season. My Account is level 234, the system should see that I am obviously no smurf, just a dude doing his placements. But the system placed me in smurf queue from the beginning on. I had to do nearly all my placements in it. From time to time there is a normal game but after a win I immediately get put back into smurf queue even though I rock a winrate under 50%. This is extremely frustrating especially for players coming back into the game. It takes away any motivation or joy to play the game. I bet there are many people like me that come back, get placed into smurf queue and lose motivation to continue playing the game and stop playing it again. Its really a big wall that is in front of you to start playing again and it shouldnt be like that.",4
2216,leagueoflegends,"Wondering why it’s gone, really wanted to watch this series, how can I watch it now that it’s gone?? Seemingly can’t find it anywhere",4
2217,leagueoflegends,I think to easily get out of Gold you have to be at least diamond+ and anything lower its going to be a BIG grind. its called elo hell for a reason.,4
2218,leagueoflegends,"Hi everyone so I play mainly top/jg usually but I want to learn botlane to help my gf (support main in ranked) and I get to gold. I don't have crazy experience but I'm wondering what combos work well in bot lane so we can focus on learning those specific champs. Her main supports are Vex, Senna, Rakan, Soraka, and Morgana. Thanks in advance!",4

Hello r/leagueoflegends!

During last year I kept track of all soloq games I played with voice communication. Voice comms were made possible through a discord link to my server in champion select. I did not use discord link in every game and did not keep track of the games where people did not join for voice coms, but I would estimate that around 40% of the time someone joined to voice comms.

Currently there have been 325 players who have joined in 229 games. The games have been played in EUW in Diamond 2 - Master 300lp range. Majority of the time we have communicated in English, but there have been few exceptions. 4 times I have communicated in my native language Finnish and 6 times 2 players from same country joined and communicated in their native language between each other (2 French, 2 German, 1 Turkish and 1 Polish)

In games I played I have had around 53% win rate which is roughly 3% higher than my normal win rate. This is likely due to multiple factors but I think the main ones are.

* Improved ability to make snap calls around objectives, in fights and macro 

* Improved ability track enemy position in fog of war (Jungler and roaming Mid/Support)

* Ability to relieve tilt from players

* Ability to discuss game plan and power spikes

There have also been situations where a player joins to call but plays worse than normal (according to themselves) because they are not used to playing with voice comms, but majority of the time I think voice communications have improved chances of winning. This is especially true in situations where more than 2 or more players join to call.

There have also been some people with relatively heavy accents (mainly French) which has made broader discussions harder, still basic gameplay related discussion has always been fine because lingo used in League is pretty much the same around Europe and is not that difficult. 

Topic that often comes up when talking about voice comms in toxicity. In my games there have been surprisingly few cases of toxicity. Out of 325 there have been 4 players who I thought of kicked out of my server after the game and 1 player who I kicked during the game. There has also been 0 cases of griefing with players who have joined. Compering that to the amount of players who have been toxic/griefing outside of call in those same games, the trend comes even more noticeable. There have been over 80 people (~13%) in those games that have been reportable either from toxicity or griefing. I think the main reasons for this are.

* Talking to someone in voice comms humanises them and makes you less likely to be toxic

* There are less misunderstandings in game which leads to less tilt

* Toxic people are less likely to join voice comms 

Overall I think voice comms improve the quality of the game massively for me. That is mainly because gameplay with voice comms is usually better and people are usually quite chill in games I have played. I would love it if a system like champions queue would be added to EUW and it would allow players to play games with voice comms. I would also recommend testing out using voice comms in your soloq games a few times too so you can see if it improves your game quality too. All you need is to copy discord link to the voice channel and paste it in champion select.",4

2246,leagueoflegends,"The pain of grinding from silver 4 0lp to Gold promos by gaining 12-13 lp and loosing 14-16 lp. No mater how long my win streaks are, The LP gain stays the same. Sure is not made easy xD",4
2247,leagueoflegends,"Posting this here because most of my friends abandoned the game long ago and I just need to get it out.

So, I had a very long 14 hour day of work yesterday, and against my better judgment decided to play some ranked. I was autofilled jungle, which although not my favorite role, is fine. But then I realize Lee Sin is banned - I was a OTP of him long ago so he is my only comfortable jungle.

In a panic, I picked Kha'Zix. And almost immediately proceeded to die 5 times in 8 minutes. Team starts flaming and spamming ""15"", as one does.

Normally, the toxicity from chat would make me care so much less about the game, but something funny started to happen. First, I stole a dragon. Team is still silent and trying to early FF.

But then, I stole another. And another. And a Baron. Next thing you know, we hold on long enough to win through Elder and a 40 minute Jinx, with me ending 5/14 total.

And let me tell you, /r/leagueoflegends , it was the most fun I have had with this game in a long time. 9x were raging everywhere! My team was flaming me, each other, and the other team. The other team was doing exactly the same - just absolutely trashing each other, me, their lane opponents.

At the end, there were about 3 ""Fuck all of you"" type goodbyes, and one ""This was the worst game of LoL I've ever played"".

I have no idea what that guy was going on about. That game was fun as hell.",4

[https://youtu.be/Y4-3sVlFVy8](https://youtu.be/Y4-3sVlFVy8)

So far I've made 2 with that being the most recent one, I plan on making as many as I can before MSI, but I know I wont be able to cover all the topics I want before then, and that is to say that I will be covering various topics, and divide them into specific videos, so it doesn't get too confusing.

This one is about Neutral Objective, those in the river to be more specific, so if you want to know about them, I think this video will help.

As for those of you who already know enough about the game, I would like to get your opinion on the video and about the presentation and how well/badly you think I explained it.

2253,leagueoflegends,"**IW(1st) 3** \- 0 AUR(5th)

**MVP: IW Ferret**

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations, fastPay Wildcats! They have gained their ticket to Grand Finals with Galatasaray Esports for another ticket, which is for MSI!

&amp;#x200B;

Well... that was brutal for AUR, i hope they dont get demoralized because of this match.

Huge team diff, mentally and individually IW was far better than AUR. 

71-15 kills overall, oh man.

&amp;#x200B;

IW always has been a team that reads meta perfectly, they are doing it again. This team always makes plays and oh boy, it is entertaining to watch them. They dont care what team you are, they will play their game and wont just sit and scale for 40 minutes. Literal LPL style team. Serin and Ferret are a menacing duo, HolyPhoenix is cracked as hell like last year when he was going toe to toe against doggo and farfetch's agression with him grants them pure dominance in botlane as always. Not gonna mention Starscreen, dude is a rare piece. He can play everything all fine and well, such an  underrated toplaner in TCL.

&amp;#x200B;

As for AUR, they got outclassed so hard. Elramir and Jool are their main weapons, but looks like IW mid jung duo shut them down and AUR cant do anything without these two.

&amp;#x200B;

Grand Final will be between reigning champion Galatasaray Espor and fastPay Wildcats, good luck to both of them!

AFAIK gemstone skins rotate every 3 months, so I guess it will be like 2 years before the skin is unvaulted.... is there any calender or vote which skin gets unvaulted next so I can at least rest in peace knowing it will take until 2025 and stop hoping it will be this year.",4

For the past few days my queue times have gone up to over 20-25minutes every time I try to get into a soloQ game - with the best one being over 1hour queue on a Sunday 2pm (which is what I'd consider a pretty good time for playing). Not only that but after waiting for over 40 minutes in queue I also got some very fucked up lobbies, including a lobby where the ranks went all the way from plat4 to bronze1 (both screenshots included).

Second, this morning, i waked up and go for some ""normal game"" on my main account aswell as low level smurf, and after a couple of game this question came to me ... Why do riot keep calling it ""Normal"" draft or blind ?  
I mean i have nothing agaisnt weird strategies (unless they are really to play the game and not just ruining fun of your teammates) but are afks, bots, hardly toxic new account and huge lvl gap are ""normal"" to this game ? because i got at least 2 of those item in every game this morning ...  
Why does riot just dont rename it ""unranked"" ? why do they dont try to do something againts those behaviours event if that games are not really ""important"" ?   


Maybe it was just a bad day for me, but i play this game for 10 years overall (i had some break for sure but i keep consider it as my main game and i always get back to it). And today its the first time in 5-6 normal game i never get any kind of fun at all ... for the past year, funny moment in normal game seems to be more and more rare ... i have the feeling that now flex are the place to get the fun i used to get in ""normal"" game back to S4-5-6 ... but did i have to try new champ and build in a suppose to be ""serious"" ranked queue ?

2268,leagueoflegends,"Hello guys! I’m back with another summary for what happened this week in the LPL! The single elimination portion of the playoffs is done and only the top four teams of the region remain. There were stomps, there were back and forths, and there were so many exciting moments that if you haven’t watched the games, then make sure you take a look at the vods or highlights! 

The four remaining teams are: 

* V5 (Rich, Karsa, Rookie, Photic, ppgod)
* RNG (Bin, Wei, Xiaohu, GALA, Ming)
* TES (Wayward/Zoom, Tian/Xiaopeng, Knight, Jackeylove, Mark/Zhuo)
* JDG (369, Kanavi, Yagao, Hope, Missing)

V5 and RNG made it to the top four by finishing first and second place during the regular season. Meanwhile, both TES and JDG made it through the single elimination gauntlet. It feels good to see the 2020 Summer and Spring champion teams come back to form even if the teams aren’t quite the same. 

But let’s go back a bit and take a look at how we got here. 

The first round of the playoffs began with BLG and RA facing off on one side of the bracket while EDG and FPX fought on the other side. Both series ended up being 3-1 victories for BLG and EDG that were relatively clean. Unfortunately for both teams, things didn’t end up going so well in the second when both teams ended up on the receiving end of the loss against TES and WBG. Just like that, the 2021 Worlds championship team and the supposed LPL superteam were out of contention for both playoffs and MSI. 

It’s a bit shocking, but that’s just how it goes. Teams have vastly improved rosters from 2021 and it seems like EDG running their’s back just wasn’t good enough. On BLG’s side, coordination was simply too big of an issue even with big names on the roster.

TES then went on to take down LNG in dominant fashion, achieving a 3-0 sweep against them. Meanwhile, the series between WBG and JDG went to a full five game series that went back and forth. Ultimately, JDG came out as the victor after out-drafting their opponents in a dominant game 5.

That’s pretty much how things went without getting too bogged down by the details. Now that we’ve reached this point in the split, I’m curious. Which team in the top 4 are you rooting for and why? And again thanks for reading my short recap! There’ll be a week break for the LPL as teams with COVID are sorting things out, but I’ll be back again before the Grand Final with more! ",4
2269,leagueoflegends,"FIY: *Divers* are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

It is easy for players to recover in the country they live in, but that won't be the case for the international players traveling to KR. If one of them test positive during or after the tournament they could be stuck in Korea for 1-2 extra weeks and be forced into harsh quarantine when they return home.

For years i have been playing league around G4 in EUW. I am getting more and more annoyed by the level of play i am watching. Sure i make mistakes, sure my mechanics are plain bad sometimes. Sure i get greedy. 

But it seems people around me either tilt for no reason, or they have no idea where to be on the map, The first type i cant do much about, but the second is just a lack of knowledge. 

I have written a few words to provide you with some insights in the game i have gotten over the years:

https://docdro.id/57DXz8n

Thats it.

When you react, keep in mind that its late for me and that im a flawed player myself. So im not interested in the ins and outs of matchups or that kind of stuff. Discuss the statements im making with me.

Ideally for me the criteria would be :
- easy CS
- mobility
- scales well
- few hard matchup
- not banned too much

So I understand that Yorick isn't that great of a champion in high elo, however in the matches I play he feels basically unstoppable. Every time I see one, he always seems to have a 2 level lead on my top laner before 10 minutes, and then he rushes hullbreaker and just pushes side lanes for the entire game with demolish, killing anyone who tries to stop him. If we ignore him and play for objectives he just ends the game, and even if we try to 1v5 him he just kills off my entire team with the combination of hullbreaker and his level advantage while their team gets baron or dragon. 

I just genuinely don't have fun when this champion in the game, and I am just wondering what tips there are to stop him from taking over every game I see him in, since I know at higher elos people are able to deal with him.",4

These things typically ruin the game for everyone. If you must do things like this, please make it easy to disable the animations. Instead, try new game modes or fun events.

2359,leagueoflegends,"i wanted to actually know how many points it would take and what i would get from a win and a loss and if anything actually affected it, like role and participation and how well you did. from 2 games that i both lost, one played support and had a KDA of 2/3/11, and another in jungle where i went 17/5/7. the actual points i recieved were pretty much the same, the support i got 167 points, and the other i got 144, i would say i did better on the latter, but yet i got less points. so im stumped as to how its actually determined on how many points you get, obviously you get more for winning, but how many more for actually doing well? or actually being useful?",4

The fact that my favourite event in the last two years was the absolute shitshow that was ruination just because it FINALLY had a new game mode that I haven't played 500 times already makes me kinda sad. What happened to the innovative Riot Games that suprised us everytime with new and cool game modes? Nowadays all thats even remotely interesting is a little minigame in the client. To me it feels like the only part of Riot that still has passion in it are the art and music department.

2369,leagueoflegends,"Hello Reddit,

I'd like to ask how common losing streaks are and how to avoid/prevent them from happening. I am asking because I lost 7 games in a row today in gold elo. I am a dedicated player who's climbing the ranked ladder through watching educational League content like coaching videos. My main role is jungle. 

Now I believe my situation is as follows. There is nearly never toxicity in my champ select screen. So that's good. But when the game timer hits 2 min, a player dies. Within 5 minutes, all my lanes have usually died 1-2 times. This is not an exaggeration. I used to play champions like Nocturne and Shyvana. I'd gank when my R was off cooldown. Now I play Elise and Vi to gank a lot, so I can impact my lanes. However, with people dying before I can even finish my clear, that's not nearly as easy. They die 1v1 or 2v2 bot. No impact from the enemy jungler whatsoever. Then at 10 minutes into the game, everyone has died 3 times or so. And I get blamed. 

I talk to my teammates in a friendly way. I tell them to play safe, as any jungler would. Usually river isn't warded, so I tell them to ward too. They proceed to feed. Still (nearly) no impact from the enemy jungler. Lanes are losing against their opponents fair and square. They tilt, they rage, they blame it on me for not ganking a 4-0 Samira - Lulu or something. And I am to believe I am actually in losers queue. Because I have watched replays to see what I could've done differently early game and it's not much. Games are really over at 10 minutes and never in my favour. The behaviour of my teammates is terrible too. They're incredible toxic. They talk about running it down and they do. They AFK. They shadow me in the game just to take my camps. 7 games in a row. Again, no exaggeration. I just do not have an impact. These past games I felt really bad. What can I do to better my gameplay or at least avoid teammates like this? I will disable chat from now on to stay sane.

I appreciate any help. Thanks.",4

This spreadsheet was HEAVILY inspired by u/Shnow's previous spreadsheets, I saw that they weren't going to be making a spreadsheet for this event so I decided to make one instead. My spreadsheet is quite a bit more stripped down than their previous spreadsheets, but I tried my best to produce a working spreadsheet that can help all of you grinding for tokens. if you have any questions, leave a comment and ill try my best to answer, though i cant guarantee I can help, Also if there is something you don't understand about the spreadsheet, check out ShnowShnow's previous spreadsheets first at their own subreddit. Thanks for giving this a read and hopefully giving the tracker a shot, good luck grinding!

2374,leagueoflegends,"Hey all, 

I live in a different time zone so the LEC games are normally on around 1am-4am for me so I like to watch the broadcast when I wake up but the LEC seems to be the only league that makes it hard/impossible to do this (they delete the vids on twitch and now they make the youtube broadcast vid private). I know there's a rebroadcast but I like to pause throughout the broadcast plus watching the live chat can be fun at times. I know there's probably a valid reason why they do this but it makes me less interested in watching the LEC, also the LCS and other leagues don't seem to be as strict with their content and make it easier to watch. 

Any chance they can leave the broadcast vid up for a few days before taking it down? they used to do that and it worked well for me!",4
2375,leagueoflegends,"So I've recently started playing ranked again after playing ARAM only for a while due to being busy working after graduating uni. While it's nice that you can see where you're placed and what LP you're at after each game during placement, I noticed that my LP drops if I don't play my placements. I thought you don't lose LP during placements? Each weekend I start playing, I noticed that my LP drops. That's really unfair because I don't have time to play on weekdays due to work and I don't spend my weekends playing league all day because I go out and do things or hang out with friends. I play a few games during the weekend when I want to and I get punished for not playing all of them? It's not like my mmr is high. I'm in Silver currently. Just started playing today and I noticed that my LP dropped by 20 since last Sunday. Makes it really discouraging to continue playing when I'm punished for not finishing my placements.",4

&amp;#x200B;

So here you can see one of my issue with this april fool featur, making those two day of play not really enjoyable

As i m snowballing, the game decide to over size Irelia and it become worst more you snowball

and the problem  is ,as you can see in the video, the spell start to be come hard to land due to the hit box remaining the same but just the visual of your champ fake your mind and you cant really see where is your hit box

&amp;#x200B;

and it same when the other team get bigger some champ like sion you can litteraly miss a skill shot because of his size

so the only way to cancel that and have a normal size to play my champ is to give my bounty

of course it is applied only on normal and blind, but as i do ranked in very specific moment i just enjoy to play Irelia to have my fun

and here it is just annoying having to feed the other team because you snowball

&amp;#x200B;

I just hope it wil be end soon

Ok it funny to recall at base and be jungle mobs, or creep, this just handicap the game.",4
2378,leagueoflegends,"Before playoffs start I thought it would be interesting to look back at pre-season powerrankings and how well they held up.

I'll look at both distance of from correct placement (i.e. TL 3rd would be 2 off) and distance off squared (TL 3rd would be 2\^2=4 off) - in most cases they line up, but distance squared makes really large mistakes more punishing and a second system is pretty needed to break ties as well.

There are probably more pre season powerrankings out there, these are just the ones I found quickly.

7. [dotesports](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/lcs-power-rankings-post-2022-lock-in-tournament) 21 off, 63 off squared - Not a great list, they overall seem to have read too much into Lockin. FQ being 5 off is obviously very costly, but outside of TL and 100T being exactly correct every team was 2 off at least.

6.[Jatt](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/siuabx/2022_lcs_spring_split_power_rankings_jlxp_ep_32/)/[cyberpost](https://cyberpost.co/lol/lcs-power-rankings-post-2022-lock-in-tournament/) 20 off, 60 off squared - An exact tie! Both had FQ/GG at 9th/10th, just switched around, which is a large portion of their sum of mistakes.

5.Kobe 18 points off, 56 off squared

4.MarkZ 16 points off, 48 off squared

3. [The Dive combined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dVlH0n9MQ8&amp;list=PLKb5ejvS-NK_LOHiw9BFFsodExDVYxYru&amp;index=9) 16 points off, 46 off squared

2. Azael 14 points off, 36 points off squared

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/84nxhzm876r81.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31489ca7b50d3bfa0587462d9160d3402b6efb78

Can't link their individual lists, since I can't find them. They mention what everyone voted when they go over the teams in their combined ranking. Pretty impressive to see their entire podcast perform that well. Azael mainly got ahead by having faith in FQ.

1. [estnn](https://estnn.com/lol-lcs-power-rankings-after-lock-in/)! 14 points off, but 30 off squared to win the tiebreaker. A very weird winner, for one I am not sure if they are actually rating the teams for regular split or if they are rating the teams that played in lockins. They are also using a picture from 2019 for GG. They had FQ 7th and TSM 9th (where they mention rating TSM-Academy? As I said the list is weird), which is where most of their point gain is coming from. On the other hand they had 100T 5th and DIG 4th, which is why Azael is still close to them.

I think the reasoning for why you placed a team somewhere is often more important than the actual placement and in general Powerrankings are more about having a conversation about the teams than being ""right"", but you can objectively be right, so it is fun to lok back on.

As a bonus I also found two powerrankings that were made before lockin, - one of them is by [Dot esports again](https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/lcs-power-rankings-2022-season) and it has the questionable honour of being better than their post lockin ranking: 19 points off, 65 squared off. Biggest mistake they made in reevaluating after Lockin has to be dropping GG two spots and moving DIG up a colosal 4 spots.

[Tim Sevenhuysen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM990wD4F4A) of Oracle's Elixir also had a list back in December, he comes in at 21 points off, 77 off squared, though considering how early the list came it is hard to fault him for being off a bit more. Most of the same mistakes that other lists had, just a bit more accentuated this time - FQ very low, C9 too low, TSM too high. DIG ended up very low, which is the opposite of what most other lists struggled with, since those had the chance to react (and overreact) to Lockin.",4

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team).",4
2384,leagueoflegends,"Specifically, if Team A picks, say, Jinx game 1, they can only ban it game 2+, but cannot pick it. If they ban it in game 2, they can neither pick or ban it game 3+. 

Normal draft rules otherwise still apply (i.e. picking a champion locks the other team out from picking it, same ban numbers and ban orders).

A lot of games this patch seems to revolve around the same 10-15 champions. It would be cool to force more diverse pro-champ pools by making it harder to ""run it back"" as teams often do, with one or two champions swapped out. 

Under this idea, you would have a guarantee of at least 15 different champs played per series per team. Game 4 and 5's for series would start really force players into difficult choices for compositions and would greatly increase the influence of positional coaching and overall compositional strategy from coaches.",4
2385,leagueoflegends," 

It's been a bit more than a year when the whole item system overhaul was implemented to introduce mythic items, yet, even after many, many tweaks and even new legendary items were added to address some outliers, we still don't have the versatility that was promised at all. Let's take a look on every class and sub-classes:

**Tanks:**

Here we have 2 sub-classes, Vanguards (initiators like leona, naut, zac, alistar, amumu, etc) and Wardens (peelers like taric, shen, poppy, etc).

Currently, Tanks have the most diverse options among all classes, yet, there are things that they don't have at all. One of these things is a diverse way to anti-heal, Vanguards got thornmails, but Wardens don't have anything, yea they can use thornmails too, but they can't CC in the same way leona or another vanguard can, so they really don't have a reliable way to protect an ally against a strong healer since they can't apply 60% GW easily, an item should be added to them, like a version of thornmail that applies 60% GW when you damage a champion 350 units near you and instead of returning damage, it would do another thing instead like apply some slow or dmg reduction or something else. Not to mention that Wardens normally build like vanguards because warden legendaries are just... Underwhelming. Basically they're trash tier support items that people just don't build at all because you'll get one shot without vanguard items.

**Fighters:**

Here we have 2 sub-classes as well, Divers (AD Divers - Camile, Irelia, Lee Sin, etc, AP Divers - Diana, Elise) and Juggernauts (AD Jugg - Aatrox, Illaoi, Darius, etc, AP Jugg - Mordekaiser, Shyvana).

For AD Divers and Juggernauts, they have pretty much everything they want, the problem comes with AP Divers and Juggernauts. Let's be real, nobody plays Diana or Elise like a Diver, they're build straight up as AP Assassins. Kinda same with Shyvana, she's either AD Juggernaut or AP Assassin, but never a proper AP Diver. Mordekaiser is basically the only AP Fighter that works and he only has 1 viable mythic and a very staple build. In general, AP Fighters don't really, yet, have good variety to build, yea they may have demonic, cosmic drive and NT, but that's all basically. All other items are just mage items that aren't designed for them, so they either go full damage or half tank. In general, AP Fighter items are just really lacking. We need more low AP items that gives sustain and cdr that AP tanks and fighters can use without making mages op. Plus, current Mythics, besides Riftmaker, don't fit AP Bruisers at all. It's just proto or night harvester because you play as assassin, but playing as a Diver or Juggernaut, your only option is Riftmaker and it only works on morde.

**Mages:**

Here we have 3 sub-classes, Artillery (lux, vel'koz, ziggs, xerath), Battlemages (anivia, vladimir, ryze, cassio, etc) and Burst (AP Assassins like LeBlanc, Zoe, etc).

The most hated class in LoL history mages in general have pretty much everything they need (and maybe more than they should, #DeleteZhonias), yet, there are some problems in their items. Basically, all builds around mages are about either stacking magic pen or just being a skill spammer with DPS damage. Well, in general, mage items are not specialized, they are ""all-purpose"" items overall, which is problematic. For example, here we have the same problem than Wardens, Morello is the only GW items for mages and not all mages benefit from it, basically, only DPS mages will make proper use of morello, while other mages can't releability apply 60% GW unless they stack pen so they can nearly oneshot their targets. So just as wardens, mages need a new GW item that applies GW if you hit a target over 700 range, and probably another for control mages to apply 60% GW when they CC. Morello simply doesn't work on every mage, it only works well with liandry abusers and some burst mages. There's also a lack of AH in general, if you want AH you must build Cosmic Drive, but not every mage benefit from it at all, and the mythic that gives you AH is liandry, which doesn't fit every mage and Night Harvester which is currently trash tier mythic that only works in silver or lower elos where people pick 5 squishies and never build MR.

**Marksmen:**

Again, items are just too problematic here. ADCs still have staple builds, it's always mythic + LD + IE + 2 other things and their GW item is another trash that they rarely build. Also, I feel they are still missing a mythic to be properly glass canon, and no, I don't consider kraken slayer a glass cannon item at all, I still feel ADCs need a range-only mythic to boost their crits and allow them to reach 100% crit without building full crit to improve a bit their versatility without sacrificing too much. Their GW item also needs improvements, like apply 60% GW on targets that were recently CC'ed or slowed (by either you or an ally) or something. Also, Nerf fucking shieldbow for melee only, seriously hating riot balance team for taking too much care of yasuo/yone bronze mains not surviving when they go 1v5 or dive at 30% hp. In general, Marksmen items are just underwhelming. Storm Razor is build by nearly no one, so is phantom dancer and few others, riot should take care on making builds versatile.

**Slayers:**

Here we have, again, 2 sub-classes, Assassins (AD - Talon, Zed, Pyke, etc AP - Diana, Ekko, Eve, Fizz, etc) and Skirmichers (Like Yi, Trynda, Viego, Yas/Yone, etc)

AD Assassins have pretty much everything, except GW surprisingly. The problem comes again with AP. AP Assassins are just pen stackers, while AD Assassins can either stack lethality, armor pen or AH, AP Assassins can only stack pen, nothing else. Night Harvester is a trash tier overnerfed item and Riftmaker is a bruiser item, Liandry is a DPS mage item that doesn't fit assassins so they can't build it to get AH and that's it. Only proto and luden. They don't have a mythic to deal with tanks (liandry is legit trolling on ap assassins) and they don't have a mythic to stack AH, and cosmic drive doesn't fit them at all. All they can do is just get as much as AP as possible and pray that enemies don't build MR so they don't need to waste a slot of void staff, or just go afk if 2+ enemies get Force of Nature because rito balance team decided that 25% magic damage reduction was a good idea along with 70 MR and some MS. Also, AP Assassins don't have any proper assassin tooling like AD ones do. We don't have items to remove/disable wards, anything to deal with strong shields and our GW is just morello which is a waste of gold that isn't even designed for them. I haven't even mentioned Skirmichers, they just build as Assassin, Marskmen or Bruiser, that tells a lot about how many items are designed for them. But let's see the positive thing, at least they have the most versatile builds around.

**Controllers:**

Here we have, yet again, 2 sub-classes, Catchers (like Bard, Blitz, Rakan, Tresh, etc) and Enchanters (like Janna, Lulu, Name, Yuumi, etc)

I really don't have much to talk here, they were addressed well when requested, though they could probably have a bit more versatility without needing to lend from other classes. Enchanters need to lend mage items sometimes and Catchers then to lend tank items as well. So I think riot could also make small tweaks and maybe add few stuff for them. Here we also fall in the GW problems for Catchers, they have to lend thornmail since there isn't a proper GW item for them and they can't apply 60% GW at all. Catchers are also semantically close to Wardens so riot would shot 2 birds with a rock by adding a GW items for them to share.

**Specialists:**

I get I have nothing to say here, since they don't really fit in any role and they're so heavily different from each other that it's impossible to make items specifically for them, perhaps something like DotA's ultimate upgrade item (?) no idea.

What are your thoughts?",4
2386,leagueoflegends,"Hi everyone, I play league since season 10, and I've always thought that hm League is kinda unbalanced but u can still have fun especially if u play with premades but in these months I was so busy and i didn't play that much, also i tried new games like Valorant, but today i decided to play some league and damn guys it really sucks. I mean, there are champions with almost no counterplay, and, most important: if I lose my lane, or if my teammates do, literally i can't have fun. Just I feel like to waste my time for nothing. So what's your opinion about LoL in this current season?",4
2387,leagueoflegends,"When your team tells you to ""Just play safe and farm""",4
2388,leagueoflegends,"So remember two passes ago(Debonair), when Riot tried the new Mission points system, where you had to Earn 400 points, which rewarded 20 tokens. The points did not roll over, so if you had 399 points, you had to play a game to make it 400, and the surplus would not rollover. It sucked and thank-f\*\*\*ing-god they reverted it until they fixed the issue.

Well, the issue is now fixed. Points ***DO*** rollover. And from the last 2-3 days of playing games, I have really liked the current system. Why? Why would I like a change Riot made when all they care about is cash grabs and not their players?(/s) Well, cause the math checks out:

**We are going to assume that TFT AFK grinders don't exist initially.**

The average game length for different modes is: 

1. Summoner's Rift(SR): 34.82 min
2. Howling Abyss(HA): 17 min 
3. Teamfight Tactics(TFT): 35 min

Source for SR: [https://www.leaguemath.com/match-duration-analysis/](https://www.leaguemath.com/match-duration-analysis/)  (did a weighted avg based on what percent of people are in each elo)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the old system gave 10 tokens per win, and the new system gives 10 tokes for 200 points, the points map out at a 20:1 ratio, where 20 points in the new system are equivalent to 1 token in the old system. Hence, the tokens earned per game are: 

[Tokens earned\/game ](https://preview.redd.it/xlvz1uzau5r81.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c4aaaf00796c50391fc705e0565623fcf8513ef)

Note: TFT times might not be accurate, and are based on what I feel the average game times are when my peers and I play the game. 

So based on all this data what are the observations?

1. If you only play summoner's rift, then you are actually earning more tokens on average than before. 
2. If you play howling abyss, losses give more tokens while wins give slightly less number of tokens
3. TFT tokens are considerably nerfed. You are earning about 5.5 tokens if you get in the top 4, about 2.9 tokens in bot 4. that is if you play a full game. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's address the issue of **TFT AFK pass farmers**. These people get 2-4 tokens per game depending on what elo of AFK farmers these players are at. (Legend has it if you AFKed enough, you would end up in a lobby with 3-4 AFK players)

Well, these players cannot AFK anymore. TFT has AFK checks now, and if you do that you will get 0 points. BUT, in TFT you can surrender after rounds 3-1 start. This surrender on average is at about 11-12 minutes. This means that you earn about 22-24 points per game, which means after 9-10 games you will have 200 points, which is worse than the old average of having to play 5 games for 10 tokens(minimum). Hence, you can say that Riot has achieved its goal of reducing the farming capacity of TFT farmers. 

My two cents for TFT farming is that if you are playing the game for grinding tokens, play Hyper roll. The average loss time(8th place) is about 12 minutes, which is guaranteed 24 tokens. Hence, the lower end is already higher than the normal TFT baseline. But, the average win time is also 19-20 mins, which means 57-60 tokens. This is better than normal TFT modes where you can be in the game for 30+ minutes sometimes and are still not guaranteed to be in the top 4.",4

It's always a little depressing that it's not included in the patch notes since it used to have constant changes back in season 10 or something. I nearly just had a heart attack playing vs 56% wr Kai'Sa! She didn't even go full ap which Is what I used to do before it got boring. 2s cd on w when it hits and 5 players trying to dodge that in a skinny lane is actually pretty hard. My team dodged I'd say over half yet when they got hit by 1 it was enough to get engaged on! I heard she was getting used more on the Rift and man before that happened she was already an easy win, so imagine her in ARAM now! Not fun! Have they talked about the inconsistency or plans for it?

I’ve also battle boosted 7 of my most recent games, racking up 4 of those games with having me getting all 4 honor spots from teammates, and a plethora of those games also say i get extra honor level progress from all teammates honoring someone.

2395,leagueoflegends,"Hello everyone.

I just recently came back to LoL, after a year or so. I was playing Wild Rift which is easier than League. I am currently silver 3, and I am on a 7 games lose streak. I was platinum 3 before I stopped playing.

I main jungle and top lane, and meta changed a lot since last time I was playing. It seems like I lost a lot of skills, but I am really struggling with items and builds.

What is the best advice you can give me to climb? How can I improve my gameplay? What should I play in jungle? Which champion is the best to solo carry in this elo hell?

TL;DR - I came back on League recently, after a long break, and I suck now, how can I improve my gameplay?",4
2396,leagueoflegends,"I had this revelation about myself about 3 months ago, which is around the time that I stopped playing League. Since quitting, I've unsubscribed from all League-related content, so I've had a nice breath of fresh air and time to reflect. I resonate quite a bit with a number of /r/leagueoflegends posts where people describe their addiction to solo queue: endless rationalizations for why I should queue again; not able to prioritize more important things; not really enjoying playing the game; only really thinking about LP; checking my op.gg 200 times a day; etc.

It took me a long time to realize the absurd irony of my situation, which was that **I was addicted to chasing potential LP, but my addiction itself was actively preventing me from getting better at the game**. I knew all the things I had to do to improve:

1. Stop playing so much (~20 games a day)
1. Prioritize sleeping and getting some exercise and fresh air
1. Only play ranked when I don't have other things I have to do deal with, so I can actually focus
1. Watch my replays to look for improvements
1. Play in blocks of 3

I wanted to put those concepts into practice, but I couldn't stop myself from just queueing up again instead. And so I was stuck in an endless cycle of ""trying to climb"", but never actually improving. I became extremely toxic towards myself and towards the game, blaming my role and the current meta instead of looking for solutions.

My revelation about how my addiction to trying to rank up was actively preventing me from actually ranking up eventually helped me to quit the game altogether. I know there are a lot of folks in this community that are addicted and wish they could quit, so I decided to pop back in to share my experience in case anyone can relate.

Good luck out there.",4

- In LPL, the highest is a tie between DoinB &amp; Rookie at 106 MVP's (equivalent to 10600 pts in the LCK system)

- If we were to add Deft &amp; Peanut's LPL MVP's it would move them up to the 5th-6th range (assuming 1 MVP = 100 pts), though it should be mentioned that full MVP standings only exist for 2016 LPL Summer onward

2408,leagueoflegends,"Hey, i am new in this reddit section and so I don't know, if this topic is discussed ofter or not.I would like to ask your opinion, wheter you think, that the objective bounties system as a whole is done right/correctly and is good for the game, or you feel like it needs at least some thought from the dev team.

Recently i played prem. 5 ranked game with friends (gold/plat elo) and we were winning on pretty much all lanes. In 29m we had 7.4k lead and made one bad call, that ended up for enemy ace and 3 turrets down (outer, inner mid, outer top). This one fight/bad call gave enemy team 7k gold!!! and brought them back into the game. Although we won anyway, it astonished me that this is even possible.My own opinion is, that he mechanic is hugly overbalanced and definitelly needs some tuning, cuz this effectively made the whole previous 29m of a game absolutely pointless and we can pretty much just start over from min one with all the items and so on. I would have several ideas how to tune this down a bit:

1. either keep obj. bounties or personal bounties in the game, not both.
2. neft the bounties by at least 50% (60% would be my personal guess)
3. boost the bounties by 200%, but keep them only for dragon/baron (remove them from turrets)

Anyway, please dont take this as some sort of a ""flame after the game"" type of post. I legimitelly thought about it for about 2 hours and came to the conclusion, that in a state that it is right now, its just cancerous for the game.I would love to hear your opinions on this matter.

""I always emphasize this, but in LoL, it is always beneficial if you utilize the paths that are closer to the enemy's base. For example - (in GenG's perspective - BLUE SIDE - for Herald fight) this path (0:05), not optimal; this middle path (0:08) is the best route; but what is better than this middle path? It's this path (0:14) - but what's better than that path?? It's this path (0:17). It's hard to explain but since the map is triangular, the path keeps getting smaller and smaller, which means you can pressure the opponent easier, you control more area, and you can move around the map more efficiently. Viktor and Karma couldnt even utilize the middle path but Ryze and Lux could. From this point on, GenG feels very pressured by SKT.""

Not included in this clip, but cvMax said that in all SKT T1 games, they always seem to have control of that ""middle path"" before dragon/rift fight. Also notice there are 3 pink wards in that middle bush lol, that's how important this bush is.

""Normally, it's standard to gain prio mid to get control around dragon area before the fight. Of course lane management around dragon is important prior to a dragon fight but mid lane is normally more important than all lanes. What comes after getting prio mid? It's this ""middle"" bush, and then next, the pixel bush. HOWEVER, we all know this, but in this ocean map - see look we are getting prio mid (continued)

""Ah, OK, we got control of mid and we got the middle brush - we are throwing a few spears - ""hey dont you dare come, this is our area"" BUT if the enemy pressures bot and control these bushes (0:22), then the fight at dragon isn't so black and white anymore. Then the players ask themselves - ""huh, if we push midlane and gain control of the middle/pixel bush just like coach cvMax said, how come we are having a hard time fighting at drag???"" Then what happens eventually is we give up the drag, push midlane/top to gain an advantage elsewhere.""",4

This happens in both situations where you are behind and ahead.

These people are being very subjective, not everyone will enjoy the same champions. For example I had this game where we played Alistar after I voted for him.

2453,leagueoflegends,"Please. I know it has 117% gold efficiency. You know what else does? half of the legendary item in the game. And those have real passives. That do real things. Hullbreaker passive is just ""gives resistances and damage to towers when enemy jungle camps you and your jungle wont gank a losing lane"" Sure, that brings gold efficiency up to 200%. But then you get nothing else. Meanwhile, guardian angel is 78% gold efficient, but it lets you fucking revive. And all of the support items wind up 350% gold efficient, but no one loses their 

Edit: it seems like people think, that I think, that hullbreaker is or isnt broken. I'm not talking about how broken it is. I just want people to stop bringing up gold efficiency on the item when they think it's broken. I've heard ""hullbreaker is super strong it has 117% gold efficiency"" way too many times.",4
2454,leagueoflegends,"So the gamemode one for all is back in the game and my friends and i been trying out some Champs.
And now I'm wondering what you guys think (or experienced) are the best/funniest Champs to play in one for all and why?",4
2455,leagueoflegends,I think for me it would be Lux. I just hate her dislike but love her elementarist skin ( meanwhile also the cosmic ones ) and I'm pretty content with that champ. Just that her regular skins are freaking me out.,4

2457,leagueoflegends,I just wanted to know why communities smaller than the league of legensds one isnt contributing and making a League of Legends Logo or for a specific Pro Team ?,4
2458,leagueoflegends,"Hey guys, I’ve been off from this game since s7. I wanted to ask y’all if it’s worth coming back now, did the game change and what is the current meta and the strongest champs to play? I wish everyone a nice day 🙂",4
2459,leagueoflegends,"With T1 one game away from not dropping a single series this split, I’m wondering if any team has gotten a perfect split?",4
2460,leagueoflegends,I feel like unpopular champions see way less play than ever before. Champs like Rammus and Skarner aren't even a part of the game anymore. Maybe something to do with mythics? But I'd like to actually compare that to previous seasons instead of just going off of a hunch.,4

2462,leagueoflegends,"Discord link is below. For those who are new, r/place is live and I put out the idea to make an artwork of yuumi being banned, because nothing unites us more than a common hatred. It really took off, so I am making sure it is going to happen. I can't keep everyone informed on what we are doing on reddit, so we are moving over to discord. If you want to help please join! We are making changes to how we are doing our artwork, and it will be imperative to see how many people we have at our disposal, and together we will decide where we will construct our artwork.

2472,leagueoflegends,"If you can find a clip of the interviews from the legends with subs, you should definitely watch. So awesome how all of them were on the stage in the intro and were invited to watch the game and cheer on their favorite players and teams.

I'm surprised these aren't shown on Global..",4
2473,leagueoflegends,"As in the oversizing/downscaling of champions, the weird random shape changes at home base, its super distracting and annoying and i dont know which riot employee thought it was funny but at least save that stuff for the fun game modes",4
2474,leagueoflegends,So im a main Vi Diamond 4 Hardstuck for 3 Seasons . I was Rank 8 Vi last Season with my Main Zerberuc . This Season i cant get a Flash Q to Work . When I Channel it and press flash Vi will instant cancel her q and stop moving . I lost games to this bug . Can someone tell me what is this about . I dont get it ....,4
2475,leagueoflegends,"I like these weird and wonderful game modes, URF is still my favourite, but now that we have One For All here it needs to be said, some champs in a 5 person combination are OP. Some champs in a 5 person combination is nothing more than a troll pick that should not be allowed.

Both the worst and the best 5 man composition needs to be disabled so we can have at least some sort of a resemblance to something fair. Last night 5 Lux VS 5 Ezreal, that was fun and epic, but than today, Lux and more Lux, and we even went Eve VS Lux, could have worked but we never got a chance to build any items and we lost.

So instead of banning Ahri, I ban Lux and yes, someone picked Ahri on the enemy team, we got Wukong... that went about as well as expected.

Basically any pick in a 5 man that is quite literally useless should be a perma banned and any pick that is a free win, also perma ban.

On top of this we need more stringent punishment for players who don't actually engage in playing these game modes. So many queue dodgers, so many AFK, so much hate. I don't mind getting a champ I can't really play, but I want to actually play and enjoy myself.

Having to wait in queue sometimes 2-3 times for a single game, than having to deal with people yelling at each other for picking wrong or building wrong, or playing badly, yeh that's not fun. But having someone join, than feed intentionally, than surrender and proceed to AFK, well that's worse.",4

2478,leagueoflegends,"honestly, i think this game is trash and is a copycat of Dota. The community is toxic and i get why iron 4 players need to talk shit but honestly if you are an honest player there is no real way of climbing the ELO ladder because of the underwhelmingly amount of rudeass players in IRON. For example.....i guess if you play your current hero all of the time youll never win because they hate that.

&amp;#x200B;

ive been zeri and lost 10 of my 10 last  games. at least thats what it feels like if you have a bad icon, someone - will eventually - at you because youre not a piece of shit enough to conform to their standards. ive been playing league for 18 years and the players are still trolling. 18 years and the community is still trash. think about that. i really hate that i hate them but honestly, id rather listen to Rebecca Black singing Its Friday. Honestly, even if you did that they will still think that you are worthless trash who is not entitled to their own opinions. SRSLY what kind of shit is that. - Entitled - rich shit pe

ople. Players will hate on you just for having a win streak. When will people stop thinking that Morgana 0-10 is okay in the first 5 minutes of game? Are you really that - shit stupid to stay next to your tower for 5 minutes? No? I forgot you were support and need to ward and i should lose because of that? are you shit fucking stupid?

God forbid you ever get anywhere in life if you are below Bronze, because lets just face it, if you care, you arent going to justify that with the 5 losses that you have incrued because nobody gives a shit about you and how long you have been playing (12 years here) BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SMURFS!.

No matter how good you are at League, dont expect compliments to actually mean anything. The people in Iron are straight up TRASH. Even if you are carrying they will still find some reason to make you lose.Is this their fault? IRON MUST BE SUCH SHIT assumingly. I mean seriously, if you are IRON you dont have to talk shit but yet everyone in the LEAGUE IRON community does. examine that. its not fucking serJust because you are good with a hero, doesnt mean your team will comprehend, because thats just the way IRON works... PLEASE you dont really play have to play league long enough to know their players are shit. are u a piece of shit? because if you play league you are..

Even if you tried, the other team will ""somehow"" be better... and thats a sin because you are - stupid. as shit.

League doesnt give a shit about you. You know those ""Dreamers' from - taking shelter in your state??"" thats who they give a shit about.",4

This post helps me a lot, but ATM I'm searching for a way to improve my ""precision"" on my left hand (on my keyboard) and to be faster, I missclick a lot, I'm not that fast, and I am a ps4 player so I am not used to play with keyboard and for example it's hard for me to go to the shift touch or alt one ect... Did a test like 10fastfingers but only for the left hand or something else exist to improve that ?

Is she gonna narrow options of the enemy team? Is she gonna widen kinks of the enemy team?

I'm 31 RP short and obviously Evelynn main, I think Coven Eve is the best thing that has happened to her. Rito forgot 'bout WideVelynn. But that's fine, I haven't. :)

2489,leagueoflegends,"I'd predict 3-2 to Rogue, but I can see them go 3-1. Why do I think that despite Fnatic being seemingly insane?

Rogue is the Fnatic cryptonite. Rogue's all 3 laners are really hard to punish, limiting all aggression coming their way. They are very good understanding points of power and don't have a carry Fnatic can really shut down or catch out. Even if they try, Malrang is really good at shadowing and matching enemy plays.

I think Razork will have an insanely hard series and Hylisang will be very limited and punished if he is overaggressive.

While I think Fnatic will win 1 or 2 games where they get what they want, I think overall Rogue is my favorites to win it.

One way Fnatic could win the series is catching Trymbi. He has suffered from this, unlike the laners of Rogue, and if he has a bad day, Fnatic can win from that.
The other is if their teamfights are just that much better, but I don't think this is the case. 

I know it's not 2021 Fnatic being level of aggression, but it still easily their strength and weakness. Razork has to be pixel perfect about everything to make plays, but he wasn't consistent at all as of yet.

Overall:
Top is pretty even, both are good at being weakside
Jungle is heavy Malrang favored, he showed better understanding of map states, reading enemy plays, jungle tracking, playing with vision and minds. Even if he gets no ganks done in this series I think he is much more likely to have big impact.
Mid is pretty even, but I think Humanoid makes more and larger mistakes, but can maybe be more of a focal point in the midgame.
Botlane is pretty similar in powers. Comp is really good at playing at his limits, Upset is the safe carry of Fnatic. It won't be botdiff this game, that for sure.
Support is the coinflip of the split. Both can be caught relatively easily and punished in a bad game of theirs. I don't think too much action will happen on lane, but in fights whoever gets caught less will win.",4
2490,leagueoflegends,"Hello guys, I have a quick question: Until when will Prime Gaming Capsule be available? 
I read there are a total of 8 capsules, but some say it will lasts for all 2022 as for other Riot's games. 
Thanks in advance",4
2491,leagueoflegends,"One thing that I don't understand in this game is that the hextech crafting system punishes you for owning a lot of champions. People have already been avoiding buying champs so they get their favorite champs in ARAM, but the reason I don't buy champs is so that I don't get ugly skins for champs I barely play.

The reroll mechanic for skin shards will only give you a skin permanent if you don't own the champ the skin belongs to, otherwise it forces you to own the skin. Why is that?? If I don't want to risk getting white mage veigar and wasting 3 skin shards in a reroll, then I simply would rather not own veigar. This is how League of Legends punishes players for owning champions they don't want skins on.

This is where the rental system comes in. Since I don't buy champs, I have no use for champion shards. Recently, I realized I could use the rental system to try out champs I want to play, even if they aren't currently free to play. For instance, I wanted to try Alistar top, but I don't know if I'll like it and there are some really ugly Alistar skins. So I rented him for a week and tried it out. Didn't end up liking it. Now that the rental system is gone, I have to go back to buying a champ I don't really want or wait for them to be free to play.  


&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr hextech crafting makes owning champs you don't like bad because you get stuck with skins for champs you don't play. Rentals were a way of playing a champ without owning them. 

Riot should really make rerolls give a permanent whether you own the champ or not.",4

2493,leagueoflegends,"WBG fell in Game 5 against JDG, which marked the end of their playoff journey this split. In spite of this, however, newcomer TheShy was able to make his mark on the team. He was formerly an IG player known for playing a very “chad” style, not afraid of anyone, always going for solo kills, and sometimes, making suboptimal plays in favor of style and flashiness.

On his new team, WBG, it appears he was more open to a team-oriented style, expanding his arsenal from solo-carry to utility, splitpush, and even tanks. He had a roller coaster ride during the regular season, but popped off during the playoffs. In fact, he popped off so hard, that he won MVP for ALL of WBG’s playoff wins heading into the final games. He had to be stopped.

Unfortunately for WBG, the newly revamped, scorching hot JDG knew exactly where to put out the fire. JDG for the majority of this split has focused on their bot lane. WBG as expected pumped in a good amount of resources on TheShy in their series, but this was not enough. JDG had their jungler Kanavi camp top almost every game, ensuring TheShy would have a miserable matchup.

In the end, in spite of TheShy’s heroics in WBG’s wins, the team ultimately fell short. In hindsight, their result was still good compared to last year. They didn’t quite live up to the “Worlds Finals” tag they had just two years ago, though they still have a shot. But it will have to come later on in the year.

WBG lives and falls on TheShy, and perhaps things might change between now and the Summer split. As an LPL fan, I will keep watching the remaining teams in high anticipation to see who comes up on top. But for all the WBG fans out there, it was a fun ride. And great to experience a better, improved TheShy. You’re in for an awesome summer.",4
