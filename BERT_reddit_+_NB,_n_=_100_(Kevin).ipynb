Or is this just a fluke that is a byproduct of my algorithm? I believe that the 2020 data would be representative of the market today, I intentionally didn't include the January 2021, because it may have been a fluke and isn't representative of future data. However, that may not be the case, in that case my bot would perform even better in that context. Another problem is with the stocks chosen in my portfolio, since I picked the most popular stocks out of wallstreetbets, it may lead to some bias as wallstreetbets may have only been talking about the stock because it was growing.

The vix also went from its low at 11am of 21.7 to a high of 22.32 at 1215. Note- there was an unusual spike at 1140 of the VIX to 23.3 but it turned into a massively long wicked candle and did not sustain that level. When the VIX did this spike SPY did not react.

            "Now this is where things get difficult. When we look at the 15minute chart from 1115a to 1230p we saw SPY close SIX full candles below the 8 ema that is in general a VERY bearish trend and numerous confirmations. The 8ema usually acts as support/ resistance confirmation. \n",

            "This is where I missed the true (and very rare) reversal. In general when SPY has a very strong trend like we saw this at 1115 where it drops very hard it almost always rests before going lower. I call it the 1,2,3 rollercoaster. Now the issue is that most play this rest period because it appears to be a true reversal as such and get burnt when the price inevitably reverts back to the trend. In the 123 rollercoaster its common to see 1 to 3 candles closed above the 8ema much like we saw at 115 to 2pm today before it finally comes back down and almost always breaks the lowest point of the day. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now today we saw from 115p to 2pm a triple top that could have been a quad top but it was able to break through. IF you were trading spy and not looking at any other indicactors breaking that 452.6 resistance that fought for nearly an hour would have been a big clue of a true reversal versus fake recovery before the dip continues. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now two things that did trip me up today was 1. The very low volume. I have noticed that most times the recoveries during the 123 rollercoaster before pushing lower as the lowest volume candles of the day. And if you look at SPY today from 1245 to 245pm it was the lowest volume candles of the day. We even closed a few under 700k (15minute) which never happens. The bullish recovery on a clear bearish trend is usually a hint. Another thing that tripped me up was the red premarket and opening red and changing to green close. Statistically spy will continue whatever trend it opens. So red means red close. Green means green close. It is around an 80-90% probability this occurs. \n",
            "\n",
            "Okay so lets take our focus off SPY and look at a few things like the VIX, apple, and sell pressure. \n",
            "\n",

            "So vix 22.35= spy 450.1…. now remember earlier Vix high of 21.72 at 1115 = spy at 452.4. \n",
            "\n",
            "As the day went on VIX ended up dropping from its peak of 22.35 to a close of 19.62. Which is even more impressive considering VIX gapped up quite significantly at market open.\n",
            "\n",
            "The one thing with the VIX I feel I missed today was when VIX retook 21.72 at 1pm spy was at 451.7. That means there was a 50 cents difference in the price. Which at the time would fit with the trend of a fake recovery. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now fast forward to 115. VIx is at a low of 21.37 and SPY is still at 452.3. Now another 15 minutes. VIx is at 21.09 while spy is at 452.32 (doji 15 minute close). \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Vix at 130 was 21.09 while spy was only at 452.32. Looking back at the morning remember when VIX was 21.72 spy was 452.4.  That means there was now a 0.6 difference in spy now vs earlier in the day at the same SPY price. That should have been the sign to sell/ enter calls. In addition, despite it making absolultely no sense the VIX was in a very clear down trend and wasn’t stopping. The one thing I will say from 115p to 2pm that did hesistate me selling the puts I was holding was that the vix was falling and spy would slowly go up but come right back down. While rare it can happen where spy falls and the vix falls too. \n",
            "\n",
            "Looking back too  another big thing was that the VIX did not fall off a cliff where it usually retraces. It was a nice slow trend down. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now looking at the sell pressure. This indicator vary rarely is wrong but you have to read it correctly. Usually during the 123 rollercoaster you will see the breadth decrese and then eventually regain ground. From its peak at 1215 of 3.9 to 2pm where it arguably confirmed a reversal we saw a decrease from -3.9 to -2.  \n",
            "\n",
            "With this indicator looking at the next candle at 215pm we see it dropped all the way to -1.5 that also should have been the clue to sell and or buy calls. That much of a decrease is not in line with the 123 rollercoaster. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now apple. Apple was an interesting one to watch today as it moved very slowly today. Apple too reached peak sell off at 1215 before recovering slowly. Apple broke its 8ema and VWAP at 115pm before continuing to ride its 8ema wave bullishly into an impressive 10th green candle close. \n",
            "\n",
            "In general it is safe to watch apple and whatever it does a lot of time Spy is close behind. Apple this morning at open was VERY over bought and continues to be very overbought on the 15 minute time frame. \n",

I watched two SOLID 20% gains turn to -20% apple and -30% spy before I finally convinced myself to sell. Greed killed me today. I saw the trend of lower highs and lower lows and I couldn’t let it go.

            " You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n",

The one person that tried to help was promptly told to shut up and hold still. Everyone else watching the horrible events unfold winced at each bone-shattering impact on the poor girl's body, helpless to do anything, it almost seemed as if the brute was purposely holding back to ensure the girl whom he hardly even knew suffered as long as possible before losing consciousness. The only thing louder than the audience's shocked reactions were the ear piercing screams and shrieks loosed by the tormented young soul at every earthshaking punch. Chances are, the poor thing would never fight again at this rate, if by some miracle her life wasn't cut short. Meanwhile, from her point of view, it felt as if every bone had been displaced, and her entire body was in burning agony, while feeling numb at the same time. The numbness was interrupted by what could be likened to being stricken by a heavily weighted blunt weapon, a warm trickle was felt down her cheek, a thin combination of tears and blood. She could only hope she'd loose consciousness or luckily fall out of the ring before much longer, the earlier outcome was more likely, as she could hardly breathe after the nigh-endless screaming, maybe- hopefully, it would end... soon.  \n",

            "Absolutely brilliant.\n",
            "When looked upon by inexperienced critiques, one might wonder why such a work of art deserves a high score. But, if one looks in depth and with a high degree of intellectual insight, we can see exactly what makes this work brilliant. My interpretation of the piece, as follows, regarding the very structure and sustenance in which art like this thrives; will be -- I believe, revealing to those that fail to understand the beauty of the B.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first thing that strikes me as I look upon the B is that one notices it is not quite to the centre of the canvas -- in fact, the B is maligned and off-kilter, slightly to the upper left of the centre of the piece. I believe that this was done on purpose to convey the underlying theme of the piece, that of chaos and unorthodoxy, that of irreverence and rebellion. The artist is trying to convey the message that our world is not perfect, that each one of the many peoples of this earth must work together for a humane, constructive effort to ensure the betterment of our civilization, and our future.\n",
            "\n",
            "This theme is predominately reflected by the simple choice of colour for the B, that of a pure, mathematically perfect red. When viewing the piece, the average audience member might simply interpret red as fury, anguish, and aggression. But, due to the exact and calculated nature of the red used in this work, I offer that it portrays itself moreover as knowing and confident, acting out of will and intellect, not arrogance and bravado. This is where the genius of the artist comes out, that such as rebellious and vulgar colour can be seen as precise, and civilized.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the white background, one might interpret it as more of a clear, sterile, and forced utopia. I recall images of Huxley's and Zamyatin's nightmares as they reflect upon the background. It portrays the B, almost as a lone child wandering off into the wilderness, being pushed to perform inhumane tasks by his cruel masters. The emptiness and lack of conscience is contrasted by the will and soul of the B. A nightmare indeed, but one that haunts us all.\n",
            "\n",
            "When we notice that the choice of the letter, B, out of all twenty-six in the English alphabet was chosen, we must wonder why. Before I get into that, let me offer some rationale and evidence from further examination of the B itself. When looking at the typeface, we immediately realise that it is of a serif font, most likely Times New Roman or Bookman Antiqua. We also notice that the B is a capital B, not a lowercase one. Thus, I suggest that this implies a struggle for power and control, over the most likely antagonist: A. Because of its Roman nature and status, we assume that the B is of a high-rank lieutenant in some corporate atmosphere, but has the desire and will to become the very best, to overthrow the A and in turn, become first. B does not settle for second place. B does not accept anything other than perfection. B is disgusted by the corruption and inability to function by A, and B plots to end the reign of the A. This is the horrible truth, the truth that all of us hold true. For yet, life is only a struggle for more and more power, control, and wealth.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is but my interpretation. Yet, I would argue that many more would hold this opinion as well. Although close to perfection, I do not believe that this work deserves a perfect ten for a few reasons. Despite its succinct and flawless simplicity, it lacks of literary elements that give more power and gusto to the artist's voice. Though violins and cellos alike can perfect a string quartet, the clarinet is left in the dark, as its own timbre holds back its performance. Though this work is like the clarinet, struggling to match the power of the strings, it does come very, very close. Though, through wavering willpower and diminishing strength, it does not achieve the goal it set out to reach. But in effect, I bow to the beauty and elegance that enriches the entire performance, for it is this work of art that truly dominates the entire concert. Overall score: 10\n",

            "It was not in my intention to speak today about our relations with Yugoslavia. The stance of our state towards that country have been expressed a thousand times. We stand by what we have said. However, I am obliged to speak about them. The Belgrade chiefs have turned a deaf ear to what out Party and Government have pointed out. They have built up with all their propaganda and diplomacy a campaign of slanders and attacks against socialist Albania. Our policy is as clear as the light of day, for at least 40 years on end, not to go further back. The Belgrade chiefs have incited the southern Slavs, especially the Serbs, to live in constant enmity with Albanians residing in Yugoslavia and those within independent socialist Albania. This hostility towards the Albanians, this savage chauvinism, this contempt towards them, this unrestrained appetite to annex Albania is atavistic within them. What makes the issue even worse is that the other southern Slavic peoples lack the courage to stop it. During the National Liberation War, we sincerely loved the Yugoslavians. We respected and honored Tito more than he deserved. We sent large partisan units, which fought side-by-side with the Yugoslav and Kosovo Albanian units in southern and central Yugoslavia. Hundreds and hundreds heroic sons and daughters of Albania were killed or wounded. They sacrificed for the liberation of Yugoslavia. But now, a Serbian dog called Sinan Hasani comes out and dares to insult the blood they shed. He even goes so far as to claim that the Yugoslavs formed our party, that they organized the National Liberation War and gave Albania everything. But let the dog bark, that is what he's paid to do.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tito and his companions, both in the past and right up to this moment now, have always refused our hand of friendship. They have done their utmost to cut it off. For forty years Tito and his successors, openly or though their secret agents, have constantly hatched up plots to destroy socialist Albania and our party. To physically liquidate some of its main leaders. This they tried to do through their old agent, the traitor Mehmet Shehu. But all their plots failed and they will always fail! In the past the Serbian king, Karadjordjevic, together with Wrangel's Great-Russian bands, brought Albania to his agent, the bandit Ahmet Zog. As a great traitor to the homeland he gave Yugoslavia Shen-Naum of Pogradec and Vermosh as gifts. The same thing is being done today by the Belgrade chiefs, using criminal terrorist gangs of a certain vagabond with their trafficker in arms, drugs and slaves, Leka Zogu. Surprisingly, a country friendly to us gives them shelter and allows Zogu to give interviews to the press. He calls for the overthrow of the people's power in Albania. We have proof that the Yugoslav Titoites, sent the gang of Xhevdet Mustafa, who we destroyed mercilessly without a change to breathe or see the sun of Albania! At the appropriate moment the world will be told the details of this affair and what it was intended for. However, the dangerous thing about it is that the Yugoslavs are violating the sovereignty of two countries friendly to us. They are training and throwing criminals at us. Training terrorist gangs and sending them unto other countries is a grave criminal act, condemned in the practice of international relations. We have only this to say to the Yugoslav Titoites: Don't play with fire, because if a fire breaks out, you will get yourself burned!\n",

            "For our part, we can defend ourselves. We know how to do so. We know how to fight and triumph over any enemy. Yugoslavia, we do not like this ominous course, full of dangers you are following. Nevertheless if you force our hand we will give you a fitting response! We ask the Yugoslav leaders not to take this hopeless course, which has many risks for our two countries, for the Balkans and perhaps even for Europe. You, the southern Slavic peoples, are responsible for allowing the Great Serbs to set the bridges on fire instead of making them see reason. Instead of forcing them to change course, to adhere to good principles with socialist Albania, to establish normal, peaceful relations with the Albanians living in Yugoslavia. We are convinced that in the population among the southern Slavic peoples, as well as among the Serbs, progressive elements. Apart from the change in political stance towards Albania and the Albanians living in Yugoslavia there is no solution. We shall continue on this course, set by the 8th Congress of Part of Labor of Albania. The main report of which the Yugoslav leaders have read upside-down. Our proposals were as wise as they were conciliatory. Whereas your choice is fraught with many dangers for Yugoslavia, which we want to remain as is. You do not pay serious attention to our words. Our expressions of sincere feelings of the Albanian people. So much worse for you, the world will charge you with grace responsibility. Some governments of European countries and the United States of America are trifling with our feelings and interests. We say to them: Nobody is allowed as before to trifle with Albania and its interests.\n",

            "This is not the past, when the fate of our country could easily by trampled underfoot, when Albania could be attacked and partitioned. To our Albanian brothers living on their own territories in Yugoslavia: As always we will continue to defend you with all our hearts, in your rights recognized in the constitution. Let there be no doubts for the Yugoslavs and for the world's opinions! This is recognized by international law. This is how all those states with outside national minorities act. At the 8th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania we made our stand towards Yugoslavia clear and we remain unshakable in our stand. The destruction and disintegration of Yugoslavia will never come from us. We are for the stability of the federation. But the the Great Serbs Macedonian and Montenegrin chauvinists, into one ear and out the other our conciliatory words go. Their eyes have been blinded by their chauvinism and megalomania. When we called for reason and common sense they pressed on with even more savage terror against Albanians living on their lands in Yugoslavia. They have imprisoned thousands of heroic young men and women of Kosovo, whom they torture barbarously, whom they apply a thousand insulting epithets. We demand the Yugoslavs free them from prison, for Albanians cannot tolerate for long such violations of the honor and rights of our young men and women. Let them not fill the cup, for the response may have very dangerous consequences. All of Kosovo and the Albanian regions of Yugoslavia have been placed under savage chauvinist military pressure. Now on a large scale is the differentiation, which means making Albanians spy on Albanians in favor of a sinister Serbian force. But the people of Kosovo cannot accept this shameful course. It leads to fratricide.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Great Serbs will rub their hands in glee. The Serbs are inciting blood feuds among Albanians. Kosovo is being plunged into poverty and covered with graves. Some do not know where their sons and daughters are. The Albanian intellectuals are being decimated, insulted, humiliated, thrown out into the streets. Such persecutions have occurred only in the time of the Inquisition. No, the Albanian people living in Yugoslavia will not allow anything of their sacred national heritage to be suppressed. Never has the Albanian at any time, or any place, during violations of his freedom and legitimate rights, bowed in submission to or fled from the enemy. You, gentlemen of Belgrade, have sent to Kosovo 60,000 Serbian soldiers suppress and kill the people of Kosovo and to intimidate socialist Albania. But we are not intimidated! We are ready! Vigilant to a man! You speak with the language of force, while we speak with the language of reason. But we also know how to speak the language of force. Albania is a sensitive and strategic key point. Europe must keep this in mind. Some sneer at our fortifications, while arming themselves to the teeth with every kind of weapon. Others underestimate our strength. All the worse for them. Certain journalists whose pens are for hire, certain café politicians with their analyses of strategic plans and the Great Serbs in the first place, spread the idea and insinuate that in these or those circumstances, indeed in all circumstances, Albania will be gobbled up by the Russians, will lean to the Soviets, etc. We tell the Great Serbs, the secret firm friends of the Russians, that there are two ways for the Russo-Bulgarian revisionists to attack Albania in order to reach our part of the Adriatic coast. One way is through the Vardar and Kosovo.\n",

            "The other is through the straits of Otranto. In the first case, without the slightest doubt, the whole of the Albanian people living in Kosovo and other regions of Yugoslavia like Skoplje and Kacanik, Tetova and Gostivar, Llap and Plava-Gucia, will meet the aggressors with guns! The whole of Yugoslavia will be ablaze. The Russo-Bulgarian revisionist invaders, if they ever succeed in reaching our Alps will be in the same shape as the German Nazis after the battle of Stalingrad. In the second case, we Albanians hold the key to the Straits of Otranto, Sazan Islands and the Karaburum. Do not fear that I am revealing any secret, the rocks are clad with iron, through which the Soviet naval fleet cannot pass! If such adventures are what our Russo-Bulgarian enemies and others want, they must know that Albanians are not a state of 3,000,000. We are a nation of 6,000,000! Ours was a small people in the Second World War. But, although alone and unarmed, we defeated and liquidated a considerable number of the divisions of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Now the times have changed in favor of socialist Albania. Hence: HANDS OFF ALBANIA!\n",

At the start of the game, there are a bunch of people that you don’t even know, and that you’ll probably never even interact with after the event is done with. The storm is forcing you to interact with the people in your area, but of course, there is always the option to keep to yourself. As the storm closes in, you’re forced to interact with the people around you more and more, and as soon as the person finds you isolated from all of the commotion, you’re forced to either fight with them (talk) or run away (ignore them). But running doesn’t always work, and you can get yourself killed very easily. When you die, that is a metaphor for the intense amount of dread that floods your mind when you say something stupid or make a mistake. If you win, you say something charming or funny that stirred up the conversation, and you have the feeling of confidence in you for the rest of your days.\n",

            "Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n",

            "A few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n",

After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n",

            "One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n",

            "Every time I see her in the game I begin to cum uncontrollably. I have no domain over it. Even when there's just a poster of her on the wall in the game, my boner becomes so enormous that it is so distracting to the point where I can't even play the game without pleasing my pecker. As not to disturb my tributes to her, I haven't washed my underwear that I have been wearing for the past 2 months. I've been endlessly cumming in my stinky underwear every time I see her. Sometimes the urges become so uncontrollable that I have no choice but to cum all over my already crusted monitor. I could cum 10 times just from the thought of her jumpscaring me. Whenever she asks if she's my favorite, I bark as loudly as I can, screaming \"Yes! Yes mommy! You are my favorite!\" At the top of my lungs. I've received several noise complaints from the neighbors, but they are nowhere near enough to stop my absolute passion for Roxanne Wolf. It's gotten to the point where the police have arrived at my house to ask me to stop being so loud and obnoxious, but yet I care not. The only thing that matters to me anymore is her sweet, sexy, downright alluring voice calling my name in succession. In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach is an overall well made game, and that's my only complaint. 9.99/10\n",

A lack of love. A lack of affection. As Will, I stand before Chris and take him in. This is a handsome, well dressed, successful man. He's looking for that love and affection, its all he needs. So I compliment his suit, his attractive features. He smiles.\n",

            "\n",
            "He stands me back up. I kiss him on the lips and we give each other a long, warm hug. The crowd cheers in admiration. As I sit back down, next to my loving, loyal wife, she gives me a high five.\n",

            "I carry a mouth guard in my pocket at all times, for self defense purposes. I'm something like a badass, but not a big guy, and have always been prone to getting into fist fights (which later also became elbow, knee, feet, and submission fights). I don't start anything, but when someone does or says something blatantly disrespectful, I have a habit of pushing their buttons until they get mad enough to come at me. That way, I can \"defend\" myself. It's not fair, because I don't cut an imposing figure. I guess that's what they get for trying to bully somebody they think is weaker. Noone would ever be scared of me (unless I get mad, and the Hulk comes out). I just have this softspoken demeanor, that makes it hard to resist trying to punch me in the mouth when it goes to running. So, for times like that, I carry this mouthguard. As much as I like to fight, I do try to diffuse things in public, where I might get in trouble or something. I'm not good at deescalating those situations and backing down, so I do the next best thing: Talking trash while making a show out of putting the mouthguard in, and dancing around like I know something (Capoeira Ginga usually does the trick. Haha). Out of maybe 30-something encounters while carrying one of these, I've only had ONE get a little physical. Gave him a little love tap on the chin, and chambered a kick by his head to show that I could kick that high, and he didn't want any, after that. Nearly everyone backs down, when they see the mouth guard and think about it for a second. It's a powerful psychological weapon). Even a trained fighter (maybe even MORE-so than an untrained one?) would think twice about going at somebody who just put that in. Even myself. If I was in a confrontation and saw that, I'd assume he might have more training or skill than me, or at least have the ability to make me work. And I'd understand the unfair advantages he'd have from it.  \n",

Common grievances at the time included inflation of regional coins, corruption, and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their power-ups varied, the Toads called for the im-peach-ment of Princess Peach, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.

Among the Peach's top leadership, Premier Toadette, Luigi and Captain Toad called for decisive action through violent suppression of the protesters, and ultimately managed to win over Leader Princess Peach and President Toadsworth to their side. On 20 May, the Kingdom Council declared boss battle mode. They mobilized as many as ~300,000 Toad troops to the Mushroom Kingdom. The troops advanced into central parts of Peach's Castle in the early morning hours of 4 June, killing both demonstrators and civil Goombas in the process.

            "Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large dick. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame.\n",

            "A few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24.089 inch dick in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so \"muscular\" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why did he curse me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum(Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. We had a fight for about three hours not noticing my grandpa was awfully quiet.\n",

            "The day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a scholng the blood it needs. Needless to say I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again.\n",

            "One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me where shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive cock shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of there, so there was only one option. \"Get in!\" I said. \"What?\" She asked. \"Get in! There is no time!\" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said \"I know where she is!\". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison.\n",

For example, one video to me is sort of funny where he says he’s going to feed his date to the sharks. I can see humor in that.

That 2018 and 2019 were the last good years before covid times and 2013 had the best mobile apps to play. 2014 and 2015 seem to be left to the wayside despite them being peak 10's along with 2016 and had elements of the early 10's left behind but also the first few specks of the culture that would dominate the late 10's. I think this is because we have not yet reached the 10 year mark of those years unlike 2010-2012 currently and many may think 7-8 years ago are too recent to feel nostalgia for. As well as the late 2010's still being fresh in everyone's minds and the last few years of greatness (relative to present day) before the 2020's began.\n",

With DC having 52 different earths, the golden age being different versions than the silver, being different from the new 52, being different from rebirth, being different from the 1 off story, there's just way too much to keep up with and every character doesn't feel like they have a real beginning and journey they go through.
