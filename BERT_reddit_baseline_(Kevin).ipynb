That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

I somehow through sheer luck and autism made more money then I started with, and now am sitting on more money then I know what to do with. In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.)

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark.

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything. SPX to be 29000 year end. \\nPositions: long everything.\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

But to no avail, I kept chasing, kept hoping that if I just became strong enough, high ranked enough, or rich enough the problems and the pains would go away.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

Developed some compulsions towards outlets such as porn, exercise, video games and more recently gambling. But to no avail, I kept chasing, kept hoping that if I just became strong enough, high ranked enough, or rich enough the problems and the pains would go away. But they never did; over a year ago after some bad bets and YOLOs I lost over an aggregate sum of 100k. It was painful, but also liberating in some ways.\\n\\nOver the past year I\\u2019ve saved up, tutored, stacked my loans and as the money began to add up my obsession to make money came back. I somehow through sheer luck and autism made more money then I started with, and now am sitting on more money then I know what to do with. In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

Developed some compulsions towards outlets such as porn, exercise, video games and more recently gambling. But to no avail, I kept chasing, kept hoping that if I just became strong enough, high ranked enough, or rich enough the problems and the pains would go away. But they never did; over a year ago after some bad bets and YOLOs I lost over an aggregate sum of 100k. It was painful, but also liberating in some ways.\\n\\nOver the past year I\\u2019ve saved up, tutored, stacked my loans and as the money began to add up my obsession to make money came back. I somehow through sheer luck and autism made more money then I started with, and now am sitting on more money then I know what to do with. In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

But to no avail, I kept chasing, kept hoping that if I just became strong enough, high ranked enough, or rich enough the problems and the pains would go away. But they never did; over a year ago after some bad bets and YOLOs I lost over an aggregate sum of 100k. It was painful, but also liberating in some ways.\\n\\nOver the past year I\\u2019ve saved up, tutored, stacked my loans and as the money began to add up my obsession to make money came back. I somehow through sheer luck and autism made more money then I started with, and now am sitting on more money then I know what to do with. In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

In the same stroke of luck, and irony I would find out during that same time my beloved father is sick. No amount of money could change my problems. I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

I\\u2019ve been chasing pipe dreams and lost focus of what was important in life. My depression still remains, and I still don\\u2019t know the answer. But, I do know that consuming myself with making stacks and clout wasn\\u2019t it.\\n\\nI love you all my fellow apps, we all have our own paths, but I just wanted to share mine.\\n\\n\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc8e\\u270a\",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse.

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas.

It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike.

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition.

What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",
