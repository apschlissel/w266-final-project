The government is punishing house builders for cladding issues as a result of the Grenfell Tower Fire in 2017 and has levied the industry with a \\u00a34bn pound fine collectively. In addition, they've also introduced a residential property developer tax of 4% starting in April 2022. Looking at the macro picture the property development industry has had a pretty good run since GFC and we're now nearing those peak levels once again and the market is scared. They believe rate hikes are about to really affect consumer affordability. In addition, rising inflation is another fear they believe is going to cause a squeeze on margins. As a result of all of this, the market has just sold off the industry collectively. Despite most (if not all) builders posting record results. It's this fear of lower earnings in the near future causing mispricing - in my opinion. \\n\\nHowever, I believe Persimmon is the best of the bunch. Primarily because it's a cost leader. I consider them to be the equivalent of Ryanair. They run a tight ship. In comparison to their peers, they have a vertically integrated supply chain - manufacturing their own bricks, timber frames, tiles etc and are more insulated from supply disruptions and inflation worries than peers. In addition, their low cost of manufacturing allows them to price homes below the national average while maintaining margins. If affordability does become an issue I believe more funds will spill over in the Persimmon bucket as a low-cost leader. In addition, they have more wriggle room to pass on price increases because of their cost advantage and economies of scale. \\n\\nThe UK housing market has more demand than supply can meet and this is the perfect tailwind for Persimmon to grow earnings over the near term as completions start to rise following the disruption from Covid. In addition, this same demand-supply dynamic should also keep prices high in the near term before it levels out leading to higher earnings. But that's just my two cents. \\n\\nThe company currently has an 11% dividend yield which further reinforces my view that the market is very concerned that earnings are about to take a beating. It hasn't been this high since the great financial crisis, which just says it all. \\n\\nBased on FCF projections (if the dividend yield isn't enough for you) the company should be worth in the range of \\u00a39bn - \\u00a313bn and currently has an EV of \\u00a36bn. The balance sheet is very clean with no debt and about \\u00a31.2bn in cash. \\n\\nThis company is a thing of dreams from my perspective. \\n\\nI should disclose that I do have an interest in this company and that I'm not offering financial advice. This post is simply for educational &amp; discussion purposes. \\n\\nWould love to hear what you all think.\",\n",

That's why EU sanctions have hit a ceiling. They need to be pushed.\\n\\nRussia: Will not stop until they either take Ukraine or Putin is toppled. Dictators rarely fall from the outside, hence the sanctions. There's at least one bank left out of sanctions, so Putin and the oligarchs are ok. Hence the West's huge aid to Ukraine, to allow it to keep fighting while the sanctions take effect.\\n\\nUkraine's image management is too sophisticated, so it's obvious they are getting a ton of help from foreign intelligence services.\\n\\nThey suddenly took quite a turn with their 'negotiations' with Russia. For some bizarre reason the Ukrainians keep spinning the negotiations as positive, constructive, working towards a ceasefire etc. Zelensky himself keeps hinting of giving in to Russia's official demands. It all feels as if they are about to sign a peace treaty, yet they keep asking for guns and to close the skies. Something's fishy.\\n\\n**My theory is this:** \\n\\nUSA is dead-set on using Ukraine to get rid of Russia. However, EU is now stalling and USA is realizing that Ukraine will lose without further hardcore support. \\n\\nI suspect the British (their intelligence services are just the best) are advising Ukraine to pretend that it's leaning close to accepting Russia's demands, hence all the positive spin on negotiations. This is lighting a fire on USAs backside to do more, faster. It needs to push EU to join the complete ban of energy/trade. This is why Biden is coming to EU next week. This is why the bordering countries to Ukraine went to visit today and started muttering things about a 'peace force' moving into Ukraine from EU to oversee things. \\n\\nCoincidentally, Republicans+Democrats are pushing a motion through senate to ban all Russian banks, which would forbid every country in the world from giving Russia a single dollar. This is targeting China and Germany/Italy. They want to use this as a stick when Biden goes to EU next week to push EU to do more. \\n\\nUSA has already stopped energy imports from Russia and banned all trade. USA has nothing to lose by banning the remaining Russian banks and using its force to push its allies to do more, willingly or not. If China breaks the sanctions it will give USA the perfect excuse to apply penalties to them as well. \\n\\nI foresee a complete ban of energy trade with Russia. Military intervention from NATO or a 'peace keeping force' that will act as bait to give pretext to NATO going in is also a good bet. They will not get rid of Putin without military intervention or insane financial pressure. \\n\\nI do not see this ending with Ukraine signing half the country away in a peace treaty. This is too good of a chance for USA to let it go. Things will only escalate further.\\n\\nPositions: SPY puts, MOS, USO, WEAT (I know it's not 'the' wheat we want but futures cost $50k and it behaves similarly)\",\n",

Earlier than expected tightening by the Fed while China is already cracking down would challenge Yuan parity. This was already happening in 2019 when the Fed was raising rates:\\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/yuan-falling-china-currency-manipulator-struggling-secretly-858981\\n\\nPlus given that the new league of self sabotaging nations (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc) is trying to challenge dollar hegemony, I wonder if JPow shocks us tomorrow to (among other priorities) challenge Yuan parity. \\n\\nIt is unlikely, but if by chance they assess that such a shock will increase domestic labor force participation (which lowers inflation), they have another reason (dollar hegemony) to do it. In fact, the Fed has repeatedly shocked markets since November to improve labor force participation. Here's my take on that and a pretty graph to show that it is working: \\nhttps://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1491974994313859089?t=_U5Px6yKJKL21o0aIE3UlQ&amp;s=19\\n\\nWould they risk recession? No, I think supply driven inflation and bottlenecks are so sudden and drastic that they're limiting growth. That's why I think we have stagflation. So if the Fed sees labor force participation as their solution to this supply side inflation, it makes sense to shock markets some more.

Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.\\n\\n2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.\\n\\n3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \\\\~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. \\n\\n4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. \\n\\n\\\\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.\\n\\n4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.\\n\\nLike fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit. No need to call me a hero.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"Thinking about why I first bought shares of AMC over a year ago, it was after the news started covering the Gamestop story and I wanted to get in on it, but at the time a share of Gamestop was over $50 while I could get a share of AMC for under $14 \\n\\n\\nAMC has always been the value-brand short squeeze play, with the price of a share of AMC being nearly a quarter of the price of a GME share... I like many people bought AMC because we saw it was Shorted like GME but our money could buy many more shares of AMC than we'd get shares of GME.\\n\\n\\nFor this reason I think HYMC is a great play by AMC, After all HYMC is an extremely cheap stock right now with a low float, meaning it would be very easy for retail investors to buy up all the shares of HYMC. Drawing new investors into this mining company that has a high short interest, low float, and low cost is an Amazing short squeeze play!!! \\n\\n\\n However short squeeze aside, drawing in new investors to HYMC and allowing HYMC to generate more liquidity with a share offering will benefit both AMC &amp; HYMC in the long run, Yes while I know a Share offering will make it harder for a short squeeze to happen on HYMC it will generate the liquidity (money) that HYMC needs to get its feet off the ground and become a very profitable mining company. Keep in mind AMC has pushed a lot of it's debt off for a few years, and even if it takes 4 years for this mining company to be worth a lot more that's still an amazing play for AMC in the long run... \\n\\n\\nBasically it's a great play because the possibility of a short squeeze will draw retail investors in, and if it does squeeze it will cause AMC's stock to squeeze as well... But at the very least if HYMC does do a share offering and enough Apes buy into it, this will result in HYMC being a stronger company with a much more profitable future, which as a longer term investor it will vastly benefit AMC, especially when AMC's debt comes due and HYMC has multiplied in value.... \\n\\n\\nI'm currently jobless so I won't be buying any HYMC, but if I did have excess cash I would be buying HYMC as both a short squeeze play and/or a long term investment. All I can do at the moment is hold my AMC shares and sell covered calls to pay my bills lol \\ud83d\\ude06  Hopefully I'll get a job again soon so I can get back to buying more AMC...\\n\\n\\nTo those of you who buy Shares of HYMC I wish you all the best of luck!!! To those of you who think HYMC is just a distraction, all I have to say to you is... At the very least this is more positive news for AMC, just getting AMC in the news is good publicity, it's good that Apes have another reason to be excited about AMC!!!\\n\\n\\n*Not Financial Advice, I'm not a financial advisor\",\n",

Considering the sheer size on the bases of these pattern formations, especially silver, and the fact that silver follows the price of gold and often out performs it during metals bull markets, why is it so unreasonable to think that based on past moves, we could see a doubling or tripling in silver price?\\n\\nAdditionally, as I\\u2019m sure many of you are tired of hearing, it is fact that silver is not only a monetary medal but also has Tremendous value as an industrial metal \\u2013 not only are individuals investing or collecting silver for personal purposes, in fact major industries must purchase it, as it is crucial for the production of almost all electronics, solar, and electric vehicles.\\n\\nAgain, considering the aforementioned facts, could someone explain why it is so unreasonable to think that silver may reach $100?

So lets dive right into it. \\n\\nOverall from the low of Monday to the close of todays market SPY has gone up nearly 4.4% in 3 days\\u2026 SPY has not seen more then one green day since February 24th and 25th. It has also not seen more than three consecutive green days since January 28th where it saw 4 green days in a row. Before that the last 3 or more green days in a row dates back to December 21st. That is nearly 3 months with only one instance of three consecutive green days in a row and only two consecutive green days in a row(February  24th/ 25th, February 15th/ 16th, and January 28th to Feb 2nd). That surely is a lot of red days over a three month period. \\n\\nStatistics would tell us tomorrow after two green consecutive green days SHOULD be a red day. Now will it happen or not is the question and IF it does happen how red will it be? \\n\\nToday lets look at the daily chart first. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3w8yiwiwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4aa8e7b8f262ee9d8eb590b6582ff3ae23fdca8\\n\\nWe have the elusive death cross only $2 apart now. Bulls managed to not only close a candle above the daily 8 ema but also the daily 20 ema which are both bullish movements. The real test will come at the daily 200 ema (if we get there) which sits near 438. We have not completely closed a candle above the daily 200 ema since February 16th. \\n\\nThe current channel we are sitting in shows that the top of the grey channel\\u2026 to lead to a bull run breakout\\u2026 is right between the daily 200 and daily 50 ema. The sweet spot will be right about 438 if it attempts to do it tomorrow. It is very possible this could continue its bullish movement tomorrow and break this 3 month long channel. IT would be the first step for the bulls to regain momentum and a big HINT to stop playing puts as much. \\n\\nOne key note on the daily chart which leads to me further to believe that we will see a red day tomorrow is that the daily candle closed as a massive hanging man candle. The hanging man candle is the opposite for a hammer candle and usually signals a reversal. In general as long as the algos and who ever pumped this 4.4% in 3 days allows it to we should not go much higher than this. In theory SPY should open at or below the close and never break above it. Over night we will need to keep an eye on futures and if SPY opens red there is a very high indication it will stay red. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wwb6halwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e432b28acfae20c929b8c7ab86a3b9bdf309e7\\n\\nThe weekly chart is one I have not reference yet in my TA but I stumbled upon it today when someone brought it up in the intraday chat room and I got to say it tells quite the story here. We are in a very much so downward trend and these weekly candles are absolutely massive compared to the usual weekly candles we see. \\n\\nIf this weekly candle closes here it will be the first candle in 3 weeks to close above the weekly 50 ema. The weekly 8 ema is still resistance and has not been closed above in 10 weeks. That\\u2019s a very long time to be clearly in a down cycle\\u2026 IF you look at the weekly 8 ema what number do you see? 437\\u2026 which is almost exactly what I referenced was the upper limit of the grey channel. 437 to 438 is a very CLEAR line in the sand that bulls HAVE to break in order to turn this bear market back into a bull market. The question is can they do it? \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vo2zqwwmwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee13360413e52c970a1807815354520b6de7310\\n\\nIntraday today on the 15 minute chart was quite interesting. The bulls came out with a vengeance this morning with some of the strongest buying power I have seen in weeks. It managed to make an intraday high around 434.5 before inevitably selling off and by all means turning a bullish day into a bearish day trend. Once the FOMC and rate hike dropped at 2pm we saw one of the fattest red 15minute candles I have seen in a very long time. We saw a recover and more red but then we saw some \\u201cmagic\\u201d aka fuckery that some how turned a red day and a clear red market sentiment into a bullish day. We watched SPY actually go red but some how managed to close up 2.22%. To say I am shocked is an understatement. \\n\\nMy humble opinion is that the market has been held up the last 3 days and that that massive 2pm sell off we saw is the TRUE market sentiment. Overall it will be interesting to see if the markets finally get to behave how they want tomorrow or not. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvkkrieqwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab3dd99bcc2654f72aa155552c5140a4f1928a67\\n\\n This afterhours movement stopped at a very peculiar price level\\u2026 437.23\\u2026 Which if you remember from the daily and weekly\\u2026. That is the breakout territory. Afterhours saw a very clear rejection right at that trend line before continuing lower. You can even see my dotted resistance line for the channel there. That is the level to watch tomorrow. IF spy can break through that 437 level tomorrow we may just see a small bullrun return. However, like I said we just may get the big gap down and red day which statistically is probable. \\n\\nAnother thing to note that on every time frame from 15 minutes to 4 hours SPY is overbought\\u2026 the only non-overbought timeframes is the daily. While I don\\u2019t put it past MM to run this up and to break the trend line IF I had to be a bet though I would say we will finish red tomorrow somewhere between the daily 8 ema of 426 and the 20 ema of 430. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n10% challenge-\\n\\nI made 7 trades today. One was an overnight $100 lotto put I closed for a nice $1.5\\u2026 besides that I managed to make my 10% goal and daily $500+/ day goal and then some today. Of the 7 trades I made only 3 were green. But of the 4 red 3 of those were closed out under 5% red. I am still testing out this new indicator and realistically will be for the next month or two while I get a feel for it. \\n\\nPosition size wise today most of my positions are only about 20% of my NORMAL size for an option trade. Most of this is to the indicator and not really looking to bet a lot of money on it. But the 2 of the 3 green trades were my biggest position size today and one of the red was of the 3 biggest position sizes for the day. \\n\\nOverall I continue to mitigate losses and i am also attempting with the held of this new indicator about adjusting my sizing of entries based on confidence of success. So far it is working well and for the week I am having a very good week. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRemember- send me a DM if you would like to stay in touch with these daily TA/ premarket posts after april 2nd!\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"I am too lazy to write a detailed analysis and WSB is not famous for its long attention span, so I would keep this DD quite short (but maybe not for the WSB standard). If the company gets your attention, do your own research. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe all know that EV's being the future of transportation is almost a sure thing and we all have heard the cliche \\\" the people that made the most money during the gold rush, were the ones that were selling shovels\\\".  Investing in a company that makes charging stations, looks like a good bet for the investors that have higher risk tolerance. I would like to introduce you to a company, that I think has very good potential, but is still staying under the radar, probably due to the fact that it is based in Europe. That company is Wallbox (WBX) . \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWallbox is a company that is specialised in offering smart charging stations for home use. That might be \\\"smart\\\", cuz the public space is way more crowded and their potential competitors there are very well-funded and bigger. You will still get exposure to this subsector by buying WBX, but I will talk about this later. Wallbox products have a lot of features. They allow you to control your charger remotely so you can schedule charging sessions to benefit from off-peak energy rates, monitor your charger status, and more through the Wallbox app. Also, their as they call it \\\"proprietary bidirectional technology\\\" allows you to charge and discharge your EV, converting it into an energy storage unit that can replace or add capacity to a home battery. Their best selling product Quasar, is the the world\\u2019s lightest and smallest DC charger and supports facial recognition and gesture control. Last, but not least, their products are very aesthetically pleasing and that might be more important than you think. For a rather small company, they have a very dedicated fan base. One of the main things that distinguishes great companies from the others is that the future industry leaders are able to create a very big brand loyalty and even if they are at the early stage of its development, you can see that people love their work and it is only about time till they expand further. It is no wonder that Quasar was one of the best selling AMZN products last year.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWallbox are also selling products for business use and their idea is for the companies to be able to use their electric fleet as a power grid for their storage spaces or office buildings. Furthermore, they just announced their public space charging station - Supernova, that offers 50 percent cost reduction and very fast charging (15 min. for a charge). Its revolutionary design allows for a no cost power boost and also comes with advanced software and touchscreen. Wallbox are definitely entering this segment a bit late, but as an investor it is nice to have exposure all of the subsectors in the EV charging business. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, let's take a look at their financials. Wallbox has a very manageable debt that is a bit more than its less than its quarterly revenue, lower P/S than all of its major competitors and  the biggest operating margins in the industry. Their revenue growth for the year is over 250%.  They also have the backing of the spanish energy giant  Iberdrola. The company is well-diversified and sells in more than 100 countries. \\n\\nPositions: 160 shares, might add more in the future. \\n\\nPS: Of course this is not a financial advice. I just think that the risk reward/ratio of this play is lower than the typical ratio for WSB favourites, but this does not say much.\",\n",

This is an optionsscheine. Apparently, it's a derivative, kind of like an option and kind of like a warrant.\\n\\nBut here is the catch, this is what's termed a knock-out warrant, it means that if the prices reaches a determined gain or loss in value, it is automatically closed.\\n\\nI also read from a user that in the German Market, these are not open market derivatives and are controlled by the sole issuer who can close the position at any point in time. (Don't know how accurate that is), but, its a positive and negative knock-out warrant.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f01lssyqtn81.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9b757f384dc7b92347632bee3c5fe9ba33c6bbd\\n\\nThis means that the gains are capped, and you inherit greater risk of losses because if it falls below a fixed price whether positive or negative, they close out your position on you.\\n\\nThis fucking retard threw $600.00 bucks at a Swiss military stock as a long shot bet, and got 4,957.28% gain on a god damn knock-out warrant.\\n\\nTalk about retarded and talk about wow. You enjoy those gains buddy u/Guns-and-Pumpkins.\\n\\nI don't know about you guys, but this shit is amazing to see in comparison to the rich daddy money that gets thrown around in here.\\n\\nOptionsscheine are by far way more riskier then our options and warrants.

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4.

But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

We all know how that turned out.\\n\\nSo, with that being said, my approach to life or investing was to focus on the little things around me. And just yesterday, I came across this beautiful songs called **What Does The Fox Say**. Lyrics pasted below: \\n\\n&gt;\\\"Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!  \\nGering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!  \\nGering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!\\\"  \\nWhat the fox say?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\"Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!  \\nWa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!  \\nWa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!\\\"  \\nWhat the fox say?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\"Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!  \\nHatee-hatee-hatee-ho!  \\nHatee-hatee-hatee-ho!\\\"  \\nWhat the fox say?  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\\\"Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!  \\nTchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!  \\nJoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!\\\"  \\nWhat the fox say?\\n\\nSeriously, I listened to the song with tears in my eyes. It hit me hard that, in my 27 years of existence, I've, Never Once, hanged out with a fox before. If it wasn't for the Discovery nature channel I watched when I was a kid, I wouldn't even know fox exists!!!\\n\\nNo, for real, how many of you have seen a fox in the wild before? what about sharks? so, my point here is this, be grateful of what Discovery offers here. They're doing some real hard work to address some real-value, nuanced consumer demands. \\n\\nWe've all seen Sharknado or Jaws before right? imagine how many people would've been killed by Sharks if they didn't know sharks exists? My point is this, Discovery not only entertains, it saves lives. \\n\\nHow many companies in your portfolio saves lives and make money at the same time? \\n\\nThere you go, done. Case closed. Thank you for your time. This is my highest conviction analysis to date. \\n\\nBut with that being said, I'm actually unemployed right now and my part time job paid me $400 last month. So, I'll play safe and only put $17k on this one. Hope things works out, fingers crossed.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \\\"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\\\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\\n\\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\\n\\nBelow, we take a look at **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM)**, which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. ZIM Integrated Shipping Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\\n\\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;\\n\\n**Set to Beat the Market?**\\n\\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ZIM that show why this container shipping company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\\n\\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\\n\\nFor ZIM, shares are up 2.54% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Shipping industry is up 2.95% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.66% compares favorably with the industry's 12.31% performance as well.\\n\\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services have increased 54.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 228.78% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -9.29% and 10.77%, respectively.\\n\\nInvestors should also pay attention to ZIM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ZIM is currently averaging 3,698,080 shares for the last 20 days.\\n\\n**Earnings Outlook**\\n\\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ZIM.\\n\\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ZIM's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.96 to $31.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\\n\\n**Bottom Line**\\n\\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ZIM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep ZIM Integrated Shipping Services on your short list.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"I'll keep this short. \\n\\nThe UK residential construction industry has taken a beating since the start of the year. Primarily for several reasons. The government is punishing house builders for cladding issues as a result of the Grenfell Tower Fire in 2017 and has levied the industry with a \\u00a34bn pound fine collectively. In addition, they've also introduced a residential property developer tax of 4% starting in April 2022. Looking at the macro picture the property development industry has had a pretty good run since GFC and we're now nearing those peak levels once again and the market is scared. They believe rate hikes are about to really affect consumer affordability. In addition, rising inflation is another fear they believe is going to cause a squeeze on margins. As a result of all of this, the market has just sold off the industry collectively. Despite most (if not all) builders posting record results. It's this fear of lower earnings in the near future causing mispricing - in my opinion. \\n\\nHowever, I believe Persimmon is the best of the bunch. Primarily because it's a cost leader. I consider them to be the equivalent of Ryanair. They run a tight ship. In comparison to their peers, they have a vertically integrated supply chain - manufacturing their own bricks, timber frames, tiles etc and are more insulated from supply disruptions and inflation worries than peers. In addition, their low cost of manufacturing allows them to price homes below the national average while maintaining margins. If affordability does become an issue I believe more funds will spill over in the Persimmon bucket as a low-cost leader. In addition, they have more wriggle room to pass on price increases because of their cost advantage and economies of scale. \\n\\nThe UK housing market has more demand than supply can meet and this is the perfect tailwind for Persimmon to grow earnings over the near term as completions start to rise following the disruption from Covid. In addition, this same demand-supply dynamic should also keep prices high in the near term before it levels out leading to higher earnings. But that's just my two cents. \\n\\nThe company currently has an 11% dividend yield which further reinforces my view that the market is very concerned that earnings are about to take a beating. It hasn't been this high since the great financial crisis, which just says it all. \\n\\nBased on FCF projections (if the dividend yield isn't enough for you) the company should be worth in the range of \\u00a39bn - \\u00a313bn and currently has an EV of \\u00a36bn. The balance sheet is very clean with no debt and about \\u00a31.2bn in cash. \\n\\nThis company is a thing of dreams from my perspective. \\n\\nI should disclose that I do have an interest in this company and that I'm not offering financial advice. This post is simply for educational &amp; discussion purposes. \\n\\nWould love to hear what you all think.\",\n",

These stocks even if only limited up 20% or 30% still have 3x even 3x to go. Sustained rallies incoming. FYI Charlie Munger bought the BABA dip at 120 then 100. BABA was last at 75 in US. It's not too late to buy this record dip tomorrow.\\ud83d\\ude12 \\ud83e\\udd11\\ud83e\\udd11\\ud83e\\udd11\",\n",

That's why EU sanctions have hit a ceiling. They need to be pushed.\\n\\nRussia: Will not stop until they either take Ukraine or Putin is toppled. Dictators rarely fall from the outside, hence the sanctions. There's at least one bank left out of sanctions, so Putin and the oligarchs are ok. Hence the West's huge aid to Ukraine, to allow it to keep fighting while the sanctions take effect.\\n\\nUkraine's image management is too sophisticated, so it's obvious they are getting a ton of help from foreign intelligence services.\\n\\nThey suddenly took quite a turn with their 'negotiations' with Russia. For some bizarre reason the Ukrainians keep spinning the negotiations as positive, constructive, working towards a ceasefire etc. Zelensky himself keeps hinting of giving in to Russia's official demands. It all feels as if they are about to sign a peace treaty, yet they keep asking for guns and to close the skies. Something's fishy.\\n\\n**My theory is this:** \\n\\nUSA is dead-set on using Ukraine to get rid of Russia. However, EU is now stalling and USA is realizing that Ukraine will lose without further hardcore support. \\n\\nI suspect the British (their intelligence services are just the best) are advising Ukraine to pretend that it's leaning close to accepting Russia's demands, hence all the positive spin on negotiations. This is lighting a fire on USAs backside to do more, faster. It needs to push EU to join the complete ban of energy/trade. This is why Biden is coming to EU next week. This is why the bordering countries to Ukraine went to visit today and started muttering things about a 'peace force' moving into Ukraine from EU to oversee things. \\n\\nCoincidentally, Republicans+Democrats are pushing a motion through senate to ban all Russian banks, which would forbid every country in the world from giving Russia a single dollar. This is targeting China and Germany/Italy. They want to use this as a stick when Biden goes to EU next week to push EU to do more. \\n\\nUSA has already stopped energy imports from Russia and banned all trade. USA has nothing to lose by banning the remaining Russian banks and using its force to push its allies to do more, willingly or not. If China breaks the sanctions it will give USA the perfect excuse to apply penalties to them as well. \\n\\nI foresee a complete ban of energy trade with Russia. Military intervention from NATO or a 'peace keeping force' that will act as bait to give pretext to NATO going in is also a good bet. They will not get rid of Putin without military intervention or insane financial pressure. \\n\\nI do not see this ending with Ukraine signing half the country away in a peace treaty. This is too good of a chance for USA to let it go. Things will only escalate further.\\n\\nPositions: SPY puts, MOS, USO, WEAT (I know it's not 'the' wheat we want but futures cost $50k and it behaves similarly)\",\n",

Earlier than expected tightening by the Fed while China is already cracking down would challenge Yuan parity. This was already happening in 2019 when the Fed was raising rates:\\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/yuan-falling-china-currency-manipulator-struggling-secretly-858981\\n\\nPlus given that the new league of self sabotaging nations (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc) is trying to challenge dollar hegemony, I wonder if JPow shocks us tomorrow to (among other priorities) challenge Yuan parity. \\n\\nIt is unlikely, but if by chance they assess that such a shock will increase domestic labor force participation (which lowers inflation), they have another reason (dollar hegemony) to do it. In fact, the Fed has repeatedly shocked markets since November to improve labor force participation. Here's my take on that and a pretty graph to show that it is working: \\nhttps://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1491974994313859089?t=_U5Px6yKJKL21o0aIE3UlQ&amp;s=19\\n\\nWould they risk recession? No, I think supply driven inflation and bottlenecks are so sudden and drastic that they're limiting growth. That's why I think we have stagflation. So if the Fed sees labor force participation as their solution to this supply side inflation, it makes sense to shock markets some more.

[Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)\\n\\nLet us dive in:\\n\\n1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.\\n\\n2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.\\n\\n3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \\\\~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. \\n\\n4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. \\n\\n\\\\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.\\n\\n4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.\\n\\nLike fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit.

I like many people bought AMC because we saw it was Shorted like GME but our money could buy many more shares of AMC than we'd get shares of GME.\\n\\n\\nFor this reason I think HYMC is a great play by AMC, After all HYMC is an extremely cheap stock right now with a low float, meaning it would be very easy for retail investors to buy up all the shares of HYMC. Drawing new investors into this mining company that has a high short interest, low float, and low cost is an Amazing short squeeze play!!! \\n\\n\\n However short squeeze aside, drawing in new investors to HYMC and allowing HYMC to generate more liquidity with a share offering will benefit both AMC &amp; HYMC in the long run, Yes while I know a Share offering will make it harder for a short squeeze to happen on HYMC it will generate the liquidity (money) that HYMC needs to get its feet off the ground and become a very profitable mining company. Keep in mind AMC has pushed a lot of it's debt off for a few years, and even if it takes 4 years for this mining company to be worth a lot more that's still an amazing play for AMC in the long run... \\n\\n\\nBasically it's a great play because the possibility of a short squeeze will draw retail investors in, and if it does squeeze it will cause AMC's stock to squeeze as well... But at the very least if HYMC does do a share offering and enough Apes buy into it, this will result in HYMC being a stronger company with a much more profitable future, which as a longer term investor it will vastly benefit AMC, especially when AMC's debt comes due and HYMC has multiplied in value.... \\n\\n\\nI'm currently jobless so I won't be buying any HYMC, but if I did have excess cash I would be buying HYMC as both a short squeeze play and/or a long term investment. All I can do at the moment is hold my AMC shares and sell covered calls to pay my bills lol \\ud83d\\ude06  Hopefully I'll get a job again soon so I can get back to buying more AMC...\\n\\n\\nTo those of you who buy Shares of HYMC I wish you all the best of luck!!! To those of you who think HYMC is just a distraction, all I have to say to you is... At the very least this is more positive news for AMC, just getting AMC in the news is good publicity, it's good that Apes have another reason to be excited about AMC!!!\\n\\n\\n*Not Financial Advice, I'm not a financial advisor\",\n",

But idk there was a time where we were pretty close and I always wanted to be best friends with her. But idk if I can go back to how it was before 3 weeks and I got used to the idea of not being friends even if it made me a little sad. I don't really have anyone to like \\\"replace\\\" her if that makes sense no other girl best friend I'd hang out with outside of school and text a bunch. Even if we do start talking again though she won't be my girl bestfriend because there is someone else who I always hang out with at school. Me and the other girl just don't text that much and yea.\\n\\nI'm a boy btw idk if that matters at all here and yes.\",\n",

I can't wait to kick them out.\\n\\nMy son and daughter turn 18 in 3 weeks, I can't wait to ask them to leave. \\n\\nMy son ruined all my plans for him. He made my family a laughing stock. All because he can't be normal. \\n\\nThis started when my wife passed away when my children were 7. My son and daughter were both devastated. They started depending on each other for support. They started always sticking together.\\n\\nI think he was influenced by his sister. He started having feminine interests. I couldn't keep it a secret. It was absolutely humiliating. Other families soon got to know about his peculiar condition. \\n\\nHowever, there were some more serious consequences, I couldn't go through with a planned acquisition of a few assets. No other businesses families wanted to see their assets inherited by a 'peculiar person'. \\n\\nI tried to fix him. I spent millions of rupees. I did try. I took him around world, from bloody England to hunt foxes, to Mexico to hunt deer and to Namibia to hunt Wildebeest and Oryx. He always grew pale and never learned to chamber or cock a rifle. I tried enrolling him in cadet corps. I got a call back a few weeks later. He has got injured.\\n\\nWhy am I cursed like this? My family will end with me. I followed my fathers footsteps, I joined the army straight out of high school, when the Sri Lankan Civil War was raging. I got my first blood, in the Vanni, when I was 19. After serving I got my degree in Civil Engineering and joined my families construction firm, just like my father. \\n\\nAnyways, neither he nor my daughter want anything to do with me. They don't want my property. Even if they did, I wouldn't allow my beloved 'walawwa ', to go to freaks. \\n\\nI utterly HATE both of my children, my son because says that he is a girl and my daughter, because she encourages it. \\n\\nI hate them both. The only thing I can do is kick them out when they turn 18.\\n\\nI only have one regret. I should have separated them a long long time ago. If I did so, I still may have a son I could be proud of. \\n\\nI don't know why I am telling random strangers on the internet about my disgraceful children. Anyways, my rant ends here.\",\n",

Ok hold on let me, let me, let's do you a favor. Let's go to the 99-cent store, let's pick out a rope together. I'm gonna give you an assisted suicide. Let's pick out a rope together right, and we're gonna take all the greatest troll clips, put a TV screen right in front of you. Im gonna hang that rope on top of the motherfucking garage at 11 PM. We're gonna force feed you. Pry your eyes open. We're gonna pry your eyes open, until you consistently watch unfunny bandu meme videos over and over and over and over and over again. Till you're gonna be like \\\"oh this is fucking torture\\\". You're gonna start going crazy, you're gonna start feeling crazy. Just, your eyes are gonna bleed, the retinas are gonna just start pouring out, pouring out blood and crack open veins, and the reitnas are just going to start engaging and bulging. Then im gonna grab that rope and say are you ready? And you're gonna say yes and im just gonna PULL IT. While you BEG me, BEG me and I mean BEG me to kill you. And choke you, choke the worthless life out of your sorry ass. Fuck you.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"\\\"Standpoint epistemology,\\\" so to speak, is an inherently arrogant and egocentric philosophy whose bases and implications alike are especially ugly. I cannot stand people who argue that it is somehow acceptable to engage in sloppy egoist reasoning when engaging in the public discourse. So many of the so-called \\u201ccritical theorists\\\" essentially evade epistemic concerns by positing that it is entirely permissible to operate on the quality of heuristics and reasoning that we use everyday, such as at the grocery store, to author academic papers about the philosophy of race or gender.\\n\\nSeriously: can people really not appreciate that reasoning about public policy and philosophy is inherently distinct from the \\\"reasoning\\\" we engage on a day-to-day basis? I fully accept that there are identity-based heuristics that are useful for demographic minorities in their everyday lives because they cannot \\u2014 nor can anyone \\u2014 be expected to engage in formal reasoning about in all facets their daily lives.\\n\\nBut if you are a bloody tenured university professor, subsidized with government expenditures, writing on the subject of philosophy, then your employment should be terminated immediately for authoring a paper with the aforementioned heuristics. Far too many individuals are terrified to admit to utter some variation of the sentence, \\u201cI don't know what the right answer is\\\" \\u2014 or accept that the ethically sound answer does not satisfy their personal preference. So they proceed to engage in a rarefied version of what the youth today call \\u201ccoping + seething\\u201d to justify the absurd and indefensible position that we should both accept an inordinately broad diversity of perspectives \\u2014 nay, *all* perspectives \\u2014 as valuable while simultaneously arguing that they can reason from personal anecdote for the entirety of the human conditions.\\n\\nI cannot stress this enough: if you are going to engage in reasoning on matters of public interest, then you must actually deign to make coherent arguments in favor of your perspectives. I do not care if you develop discriminatory heuristics to conduct your daily life insofar as they are adaptive and eschew cruelty (an aside: the late Judith Shklar's indispensable essay on the subject is a must-read for those who consider themselves benevolent human beings), but that does not and cannot justify those same heuristics being applied to public policymaking.\\n\\nOne can even be a theorist of why it is permissible to develop adaptive heuristics that involve objectively unfair discrimination against a group considered dominant as a means of maximizing well-being from a qualified utilitarian standpoint. But one cannot though apply those same principles to public reasoning and logic, because they are inherently grounded in behaviors instrumentally adaptive to the individual \\u2014 not what is just for society.\\n\\nIt is incredibly ironic to the author of this treatise that the very same individuals who constantly advocate for \\\"social justice\\\" in practice make arguments in the public discourse that bare not even the slightest relation to justice. They are making what in essence are pragmatic arguments about what is instrumentally adaptive for individuals with various identities to behave like, and then arguing that society should either punish or reward such people (with the outcome of this binary, of course, being based upon reductionist demographic identities). They are not, in fact, justifying the actions as they relate to justice: they are rationalizing why other people shouldn't criticize what they view as individually adaptive behaviours and then saying that a behaviour which is individually adaptive to members of one identity is inherently justified for all members of that identity.\\n\\nCome to think of it, the above is really a particularly egregious form of social rent-seeking, wherein practitioners adopt the phraseology of intersectionality to advocate especially narrow bands of interest and then rationalize why what they are doing is in fact about the essential nature of their identity in collective.\\n\\nThe arguments of these individuals are simply riddled with mottes and bailies, dodging between deontological and utilitarian justification for anecdotal behaviours with such rapidity that no one is capable of pinning them down for a sufficient duration to disaggregate and defeat their arguments. And should you attempt to do so, be prepared: they will mobilize their outsized social power to attempt to delegitimize your critique of their ultimately risible premises.\\n\\nIt is a classic tactic of historicists desiring to defend ideologies that are incoherent or absurd when soberly analyzed by those engaging in intellectually honest \\u2014 as opposed to motivated \\u2014 reasoning once they realize that they are unable to defend them by way of reasoned argument: these glorified sophists resort to constructing abstract and unfalsifiable social structures and to defend their ideas (the Maoist-style lynch mobs and struggle sessions they will lead against you for daring to publicly contradict them, however, are very *much* tangible and appreciable to the average man on the street).\\n\\nA particularly instructive example is the labor theory of value. Socialists and communists both in the East and West hemispheres of the world spent decades attempting to argue in defense of its absent validity *long* after its myriad absurdities had been laid bare via a series of, again, mottes and bailies whose essential purpose was to insinuate or outright claim that its critics despised the poor and downtrodden, or, even more sickeningly, believed that human life was inherently worthless.\\n\\nOh, sure: this world is not fair. Far too many suffer needless injustice. Yet no amount of discrimination and inequality justifies a tenured professor in a $650 suit from a San Francisco Louis Vuitton (okay, the Louis Vuittons that still retain any items in their inventories after the massive crime wave brought about the civilizationally destructive policies of the Marxist son of Jewish domestic terrorists currently occupying its top prosecutorial office) adopting these categories of behaviours. You may not take public money to reason about the public good and then proceed to assert that you do not have to reason from an objective standard.\\n\\nIn particular, it is irritating to watch a Black American professor from Georgetown University make such arguments \\u2014 to witness them assert that they do may simply refuse to engage in good-faith discussion with their academic critics by instrumentalizing the experiences of the genuinely underprivileged black women (some of whom I worked with in my PhD program when I took on a supervisorial job with Amazon to supplement my income as a poor international student attending Princeton). Sorry: only the latter group retain the right and privilege to use heuristics in their daily lives to deal with the discrimination that black public intellectuals speaking on what is just for society writ large plainly do not. The same issue and principle applies to much if not the outright majority of literature on transgender issues, where academics regularly pull sleights of hand as a means of pretending that they can treat their good-faith critics the same way a transgender individual being asked an identical question while they were trying to work as a cashier may.\\n\\nThis extremely malignant, contemptibly self-interested form of public reasoning, the moral taint of which is only lessened by the fact that, the author believes, too many individuals sincerely do not believe that this is the reality because they have essentialized their identity in such ways that enable them to deploy these types of duplicitous reasoning games.\\n\\nOften, the arguments are little more than the obverse of those made by \\\"scholarly\\\" white supremacists in the 1930s who resorted to play the same kinds of linguistic games when others thoroughly dismantled their earlier attempts at legitimate public reasoning. It is the reason why they retreated from actually trying attempting to prove a scientific or logical basis for racist discrimination into patently insulting arguments in the vein of \\\"\\\\[r\\\\]efusing to tolerate racism from white American southerners is in fact an attack on Southern heritage.\\\" One need only to observe the manner in way Richard Russell's arguments evolved over time as a means to frustrate salient critiques of his dastardly career to understand the way critical theorists, past and contemporary, have operated over the years. The more they are challenged on their analytical and epistemic failings, the more they retreat over a protracted duration of time into the essential \\\"essence\\\" and emotional needs of their respective identity groups.\\n\\nYes \\u2014 the dynamic of power was and remains different at the national level, but it is a highly effective tactic if you were or are locally dominant in a given institution or region. If you hold social power within such an institution, then you can employ it to suppress legitimate criticism from within. As such, you no longer require sound arguments to deal with external actors; you just need to make arguments that obfuscate the injustice of what you are arguing for.\\n\\nTo be clear: I am not saying the aforementioned groups are identical or morally equivalent (for one, Russell knew full well what he was doing, and laid it out explicitly in internal memorandums we only now have access to). Yet both exploit asymmetries of power and concern in a way that allows them to engage in poor, even destructive public policy reasoning in their prescriptions for the society in which we live. It is critically important to recognize this brand of malignant public reasoning when it rears its ugly head precisely because it is permissive of the obfuscation of justice to be doled out most effectively. And it is worsened in both cases by the elite biases of the journalistic class \\u2014 who mediate the interactions between these such groups \\u2014 and the mass public.\\n\\nLet us return to Russell's case: the Governor was capable of escaping with incoherent argumentation because even the liberal white voters of the 1950s were scarcely concerned with interrogating them; they may have thought that although he was wrong on some level, but they extended him excessive assumptions of good faith in the rarefied Washington political circles of the day.\\n\\nA near-identical dynamic happens with journalism in the present day as well as the modern social justice movement, where indefensible arguments are merely tolerated, uncritically, from progressively-coded voices because journalists do not wish to suffer the social sanctions resulting from a timid \\u2014 let alone spirited \\u2014 attempt to challenge them. This, then, necessitates that the modern social justice movement is only ever contested by those sufficiently far from the progressive mainstream such they may be delegitimized epistemically within the institutions and regions where this style of poisonous reasoning rules with an iron fist.\\n\\nI cannot stand this fundamental dynamic among professors, because it is quite frankly the very *purpose* of conducting academic research. Yes, normal people are going to harbor objectively silly, egocentric heuristics that may feel appear adaptive to them but damage the societal fabric in the collective; that does not mean that an anthropological professor from Columbia University has that substantive basis engage in the same behavior. It is just so bloody lazy. Have the decency to shut up and retire if you cannot make any legitimate contribution to your perennially deteriorating field! It is an imperative for us as a society to construct structures that strongly discourage conflict entrepreneurialism solely for the purpose of maintaining the job of the researcher freeloading on the public dime.\\n\\nAnd that brings me to my antepenultimate point: the inherent difficulty with occupations reliant on demand from the social relevance of a topic is that its careerists must in perpetuity argue for the social relevance of their topic, no matter the tortured logic or nonexistent evidence \\u2014 after all, they have to pay the rent on their studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. This is a classic example of rent-seeking: it is the weaponization of asymmetric information and social status to accumulate rents without producing usefully oneself. Social media has only magnified the incentives for this kind of behaviour exponentially. More than ever, structural means designed from the middle up to minimize such perverse incentive are critically necessary.\\n\\nThe author has heard it described by the legendary Western philosopher William Luther Pearce as the \\\"George and the Dragon Incentive\\\" in relation to social activism: in summation, if it is the case that if one's occupation is created around the existence of a widespread social ill, actually *solving* said social ill becomes extremely costly for you on an individualized basis even if the benefits accruing to society in the collective are great. So, subject to classic concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, activists are heavily incentivized to partake in anti-social conflict entrepreneurialism and then rationalize why such destructive behaviour is necessary. Even more significantly, this very problem applies to a vast swathe of academic fields whose essential demand function relies on their ability to maintain a perennial \\\"discourse\\\" \\u2014 epistemological quality be damned \\u2014 and the constant presence of societal ailments.\\n\\nIn closing: it is perhaps true that past norms of respectability and its adjacents stood as crude means of suppressing this destabilizing incentive in some fashion. But we as a society, as a common people, desperately need to figure out a viable solution in this era of pervasive social media and postmodern psychosis.\",\n",

I find his kind demeanor admirable, and most importantly, his caring attitude towards his friends. The moment where he hugged the protagonist, \\\"Kris\\\", I could feel his warmth radiating through the cold and unfeeling monitor.\\n\\nThis has however, had the rather unfortunate effect of creating a void within my very being. I now yearn to search for a companion just like the character \\\"Ralsei\\\". I must acquire a companion who is male, slightly older than me, huggable, fluffy, knows how to bake, hugs me when sad, frequently outfits himself with green, type of friend. He must be knowledgeable about politics and world events as reflective of his character in \\\"Delta-Rune\\\", preferably holding traditional right wing conservative views, and be an avid connoisseur in the hobby of firearms, so as to be compatible with my own personality.\\n\\nThis companion must also be soft and kind, to the point where he is sometimes teased by my other, more masculine and strong friends (in a friendly nature of course!), but not so much where he is bullied by others who seek to exploit his innocence. He must also not be the ever so dreadful \\\"beta-male\\\" stereotype, as it would mean he would consume products made of soy and use the Nintendo Switch gaming console. Did I mention he must be soft and huggable?\\n\\nI believe I am not requesting much. Such a companion should be a kindred spirit. If you fine folks have any advice on perhaps, finding, acquiring, or perhaps even creating such a friend, please do let me know. I would greatly appreciate it.\\n\\nMy warmest farewells to thee.\",\n",

So if you are really in this situation you should study CBDC since this would make this 100% impossible.\\n\\nLets say you have $1.2M physical money. you're in the USA, and you want to get around the tax system. And lets say you're 18, so you have a number of years. The easiest way is through using tax loopholes. Even more capital gains tax loopholes.\\n\\nLong term capital gains you don't have to pay taxes on the first $40k (check with your tax person since this changes every year).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf I was to do this I would backdate something I own to make it look like I owned it for over 12 months. I would move to a state with 0 capital gains tax like FL. I would then sell it to myself anonymously for $40k. I would officially buy it back for $1. Repeat this yearly for 30 years.\\n\\nTo figure out that thing I would use, I would have to talk to an accountant. I know if you use something like a chair you might have to deal with sales tax. Art has their own tax code I am not familiar with so maybe that. Like many criminals use something called freeports with art to get around the tax system.\\n\\nA big thing to note with freeports is [https://secretsofartmagazine.com/2020/02/freeport-for-artworks-a-tool-to-avoid-tax-duties-might-come-to-an-end/](https://secretsofartmagazine.com/2020/02/freeport-for-artworks-a-tool-to-avoid-tax-duties-might-come-to-an-end/)\\n\\n# What makes a freeport truly exceptional and attractive to the art collectors is the fact that the contents of freeports are invisible to tax authorities and foreign governments. Complete anonymity is guaranteed and art collections in freeports cannot be traced to the original owners and no government can tax these assets.\\n\\nNote this is tax avoidance and not tax evasion. Tax evasion is 100% illegal. Tax avoidance is using loopholes to legally qualify to pay lower taxes.\\n\\nOne avoidance tactic that the richest people use is loans. Much of the value of the richest people is not in currency. It is within stocks, properties, and so on. So what happens is if they sale then they have to pay taxes depending on the amount being sold. But if you take an overcollateralized loan against the assets, and use the loan as you would with normal income. It isn't taxed because it is a loan. Now because the amount being taken out and the people involved, the interest rate is near 0%, and buying a number of properties to rent them out is more than enough to pay off the base payment on the loan (hint why the anti-remote work has kicked up. Commercial prosperity values tanked and there is extremely less renters, which means rich people are risking a lot more if they pay off the minimum. So you are having to go to your physical office to keep some random rich person happy not from the work you are doing. But from the rental payments your company is giving to the management company which pays the rich person.) Anyways, when they want to buy a jet, they make a company around that and lease the jet out to themselves for $1. The cost of everything becomes a business expense which helps lower taxes by a good bit.\\n\\nI can go on, but I'm sure everyone gets my point in the ultra rich use tax avoidance all the time to get around the system (a fix to this btw is flat tax and get rid of freeports, but the political people who can fix this also use this same system against itself).\",\n",

I find his kind demeanor admirable, and most importantly, his caring attitude towards his friends. The moment where he hugged the protagonist, \\\"Kris\\\", I could feel his warmth radiating thorugh the cold and unfeeling monitor.\\n\\nThis has however, had the rather unfortunate effect of creating a void within my very being. I now yearn to search for a companion just like the character \\\"Ralsei\\\". I must acquire a companion who is male, slightly older than me, huggable, fluffy, knows how to bake, hugs me when sad, frequently outfits himself with green, type of friend. He must be knowledgeble about politics and world events as reflective of his character in \\\"Delta-Rune\\\" , preferrably holding traditional right wing conservative views, and be an avid connoisseur in the hobby of firearms, so as to be compatible with mine own personality.\\n\\nThis companion must also be soft and kind, to the point where he is sometimes teased by my other, more masculine and strong friends (in a friendly nautre of course!), but not so much where he is bullied by others who seek to exploit his innocence. He must also not be the ever so dreadful \\\"beta-male\\\" stereotype, as it would mean he would consume products made of soy and use the Nintendo Switch gaming console. Did I mention he must be soft and huggable?\\n\\nI believe I am not requesting much. Such a companion should be a kindred spirit. If you fine folks have any advice on perhaps, finding, acquiring, or perhaps even creating such a friend, please do let me know. I would greatly appreciated it.\\n\\nMy warmest farewells to thee.\",\n",

He is intelligent, kind, and overall wonderful. But we keep running into a problem. He is becoming a little aggressive with his kink. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he thinks that me wearing fox ears during sex is adorable and hot. I thought it was cute too so I played along. I'm usually the dominant one in our relationship and it fit well into that narrative. But now it's becoming more present in our relationship than I'd like. He wants me to wear the ears all the time, and he literally talks to me in baby talk (the way you'd talk to a dog in public). We went to target and while I was looking for some birthday cards for my dad, he said \\\"Aww you're being such a good girl, I wish you had your little fox tail to wag\\\". Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him. He got really sad and told me that of course he loves me for me. He's been really quiet since. Have I fucked up? Am I being too insensitive about his fetish?\",\n",

She cant reathe but she digests the tip of my sausage and lives upon the nutrients. She cries and cries and tries to reach for her gun - but it isnt in her holster. Ive got it behind my . I pull it out - she freaks out. You can see what little hope she has left degrade further and further - she wont survive this. But she has one thing, one hope, one personto cling on to - and he just knocked on the door. \\\"judy? \\\" i hear nick's voice and picture  his smug face before i see it. I turn around. Nick. He stands there horrified, groceries in hand, as he witnesses the horrors happening before him. Judy is choking on my pork chop and running out of air - and time. Her tearful eyes look to nick in desperation, then realization, as she sees the revolver in my  hand. I lift it, quivering, at the wilde's freaking face. He freezes, my finger squeezes, a shot rings off. Hole in his head, brains on the wall behind him. I have slain the mighty nicholas wilde, and extinguished the dying flame of hope that judy clung to. She stops fighting for her life after watching nick sink to the floor. Within seconds, she is dead, mouth still on my sausage, reaching all the way down to her stomach. Finally, it bursts. Gallons of piping hot cream are flung into the stomach of the dead hopps. At last, i am satisfied.\",\n",

Or like even before that since we both just didn't mind it and had fun together being a regular couple and all but like she asked me when her last period was and I thought it was at 26 so I told her that, she got reassured but I backread our messages and well turns out it was at december 24 she got mad at me and told me how I didn't have to tell her that unnesesarry information and she was late for 2 days and of course I don't blame her at all since her life is gonna change drastically if she was to be pregnant, I also was shocked on it aswell and is very worried since I really really value her alot and I care so much about her. After that she didn't wanna talk with me at all, I kept spamming her, reassuring her even told her that I'll be glad to help if things do get bad but well she would just leave me on read, except for the fact that she would say that I should focus on myself first and not worry about her yknow. As of now she's 6 days late on her period and Im very much am worried about how things would turn out and well today was the day she told me she lost feelings for me already, I kept trying to make her stay but she really isn't interested in me anymore,she told me I shouldnt be desperately waiting for nothing and that I shouldnt wasting my time someone that has lost feelings for me . Oh and for more context one of the reasons were probably because during november and december we've gotten in some fights but eventually we resolved it together as a partner, still she told it was best for the both of us and it really does hurt for me she was the best person to be there for me, I appreciated the things she did for me and I love her still so much, I just cant get over her, I literally have her as my wallpaper, her phone case, her sim card, her bra bracelet every single thing and she was the one that changed my appearance the most, I planned alot of things to do with her in the future and I still wanna stay by her side, I  I value her so fucking much dawg I can't stop balling my eyes out this is by far the worst thing that has happend to me. I wanna hug her one last time like it's just painful man everything reminds me of her confused\\n\\n\\u2022\\u0301  \\u203f ,\\u2022\\u0300\",\n",

But of course I had waffles and maple syrup for breakfast, and then I went outside and chatted all day long, and when night reared its peaceful face, the show was on. At a slow pace, the night went by. I almost fell asleep but not quite, and while the cold did give quite an awful bite, even a little frost nip could be warmed by friendship. Friends to talk to, friends to get. People to laugh with, and dogs to pet! I loved that day, and I loved that night, but I had eaten beans for dinner, so I had to shite. I vaguely remember their faces, and the laughs we shared, going on and on without a care. Life was good, and life was nice. The lights turned off when the sun came up, and it awoke the pup on my lap. It had been a whole night, and a fun one at that. I put on my jacket and I put on my hat, I left with my parents and it ended with that. I had fun, I'd met new people, I'd laughed and loved, making a nice cup of mud. I'd miss them, those amazing random people. I'd bonded with that silly little puppy, he was cute, oh wasn't he? But those friendships had to end, the joy is not constant, I had no more time to spend. As I left in the car, I looked back at the people, not one of them evil, and I thought \\\"all that happiness surely can't be legal!\\\" It was nice, I will miss them. That day and that night? That was a gem. They sprouted out happiness like leaves from an elm. It was wonderful, a dream-like realm. As I was and still am only fourteen, this amount of interaction was completely unforeseen, but I enjoyed it, I have to admit. Thank you for listening, and please have a good day! And remember; somebody cares about you, even if they're a stranger. Those can lead to relationships stronger and more beautiful than a diamond!\",\n",

The Pok\\u00e9mon were more memorable than other gens because many were made for specific purposes Chansey/ Kangaskhan for the safari zone, Snorlax for path blocking, etc. but the graphics are awful. It\\u2019s a gameboy game so I can\\u2019t complain. Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it.\\n\\nGold/Silver/Crystal: They added the Rocket grunt theme : )! Two regions! Legendary beasts and day/ night! Don\\u2019t forget about friendship! Loads of new content, that\\u2019s great. As for the story\\u2026 homeless Team Rocket? Slowpoke Tails? Err.. scary Miltank? Jerkier rival than Blue/Green/Gary/Pooface? I don\\u2019t have much to say. This game is alright, but its Kanto is pretty empty. It is a Gameboy game though. Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it.\\n\\nRuby/Sapphire/Emerald: Music absolutely slaps! Gives me nostalgia even though I only played ORAS and a bit of Emerald recently! Ah, yes the GBA. Truly loves up to the A. Much improved graphics and sound quality. THIS is what I think of when I think \\u201cold Pok\\u00e9mon.\\u201d Only real complaints are that in this game Archie/Maxie\\u2019s goals are harder to understand than in ORAS (shout out to ORAS for that!) and Archie/Maxie are essentially the same person. One likes water, one likes land. (Once again, shout out to ORAS for that!)\\n\\nDiamond/Pearl: I strongly dislike these. SLOW. The game has pauses. EVERY SINGLE TURN. In a TURN BASED GAME. For people who don\\u2019t want to take a whole move slot for defog to travel through one route. That route was most of my gameplay. Half of my moves missed (fog) waiting forever for my turn\\u2026 absolute pain! Also, story was never a strong thing for Pok\\u00e9mon games\\u2026 but come on! Man sad. He no longer wants sad. Wants to destroy world? Defeat him? He and his stupid Team JUST DISAPPEAR WITH A FLASH. THAT\\u2019S IT.\\n\\n\\nPlatinum: Imagine Diamond/Pearl, but a much better game. Story improved. No battle pauses! (HP bar still takes a long time to go, BUT so much of an improvement!) Fantina\\u2019s and Gardenia\\u2019s gyms are improved! Instead of Team Galactic just disappearing, CYRUS GETS KIDNAPPED! Sounds like a terrible thing to be excited about, but after the yawnfest that DP was, Platinum is AMAZING. (Plus this game doesn\\u2019t have the stupid 151 Pok\\u00e9dex like DP.) (also, nostalgic soundtrack!)\\n\\n\\nBlack/White: \\u201cOMG!! N IS SO ATTRACTIVE\\u201d \\u201cGhetsis best villain ever!!\\u201d \\u201cGREATEST GAME EVAH!!\\u201d I have nothing against these games. Love the soundtrack, love the designs and Team Plasma. But\\u2026 these games are more linear than SWSH! But at least the games have cool puzzle areas like Chargestone cave and Reversal mountain. Good Game overall. Just REALLY FLIPPIN\\u2019 Overrated.\\n\\n\\nB2W2: This is THE GAME! Team Plasma\\u2019s cooler, The gym theme\\u2019s better, and Black/White Kyurem! Also the PWT with the past gym leaders and new remixes for their theme may be Nostalgia bait, but it is MUCH BETTER NOSTALGIA BAIT THAN TEAM RAINBOW ROCKET. It makes a lot of sense honestly, who WOULDN\\u2019T wanna become world champ? Anyways, onto the games everyone seems to hate.\\n\\nX/Y: Kanto. Wait, I thought this was Kalos! Nope. There\\u2019s three sectors of the Pok\\u00e9dex. All three have exactly 151 Pok\\u00e9mon to catch. The professor gives you a Kalos starter\\u2026 and a Kanto starter. This gen introduced mega evolution! What Pok\\u00e9mon can mega evolve? Hopefully less powerful Pok\\u00e9mon that need a power boost\\u2026 let\\u2019s see. Blastoise\\u2026 Venusaur\\u2026 Gengar\\u2026 Charizard gets two? Mewtwo gets two as WELL?! Pandering. Gen 1 pandering. Anyways\\u2026 lets try to ignore that. Dreadfully easy. No difficulty options. Lysandre is cooler than Cyrus. Anyways.. There\\u2019s a story about a war and an immortal man\\u2026 it\\u2019s hard to remember, but felt sort of out of place in Pok\\u00e9mon, even though I liked it. Overall, truly great soundtrack amd improved graphics. Loved character customization (although male options stink.)\\n\\nORAS: Essentially just better Ruby/Sapphire (not emerald.)\\n\\nSun/Moon: even worse gen 1 worshiping than X/Y. Main Character is from Kanto. Only Kanto Pok\\u00e9mon get regional forms. There\\u2019s way more in USUM, just wait. Lillie. I wish she got better development than her just going to KANTO. She gave us Nebbie. Why?? \\u201cThese four tiny islands will be such a better adventure than the massive Kanto-Johto region\\u201d honestly, we just play as a camera to see Lillie\\u2019s story. Like we\\u2019re playing as the Lakitu from SM64. Remember kids when WE were the main character? Pepperidge farm remembers. The island trials were refreshing, but where\\u2019s Mina\\u2019s trial? What about that CLEARLY VISIBLE UNUSED GOLF STRIP? EH? Clearly made for Kahili. Also, I don\\u2019t mind cutscenes if they\\u2019re skipppable\\u2026 they\\u2019re not. It\\u2019s AWFUL. Every two minutes\\u2026 a cutscene! USUM IS EVEN WORSE WITH THIS! I\\u2019ll write USUM later it\\u2019s so bad. It\\u2019s so bad it manages to be worse than S/M.\\n\\nSWSH: it\\u2019s painfully easy,awkward to play. But its cutscenes are skippable! 10/10 experience after playing USUM!!\\n\\n\\u201cBrilliant\\u201d Diamond and \\u201cShining\\u201d Pearl: Essentially just fast HD Diamond and Pearl. Not platinum\\u2026 Diamond and Pearl feels like a copy/paste. Cyrus doesn\\u2019t even get kidnapped! Boo! Not a single new thing except\\u2026 clothes (a basic feature that should be in every game\\u2026 and legendaries. How original.) Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it. Unlike the others I don\\u2019t know the exact experience playing it, I played Diamond and Pearl so I know EXACTLY WHAT IT\\u2019S LIKE playing it.\\n\\nI respect your opinons and these are just mine.

I felt like I was being raped by a horse. Push and push and it barely moved an inch. Relaxed for a couple minutes then intermittently pushed. Started panting like a woman giving birth, then relax and push again. Pant, pant, pant, puuush! I was starting to reach for the nurse emergency call button but was too embarrassed. \\u201cExcuse me but would you mind helping me remove this log out of my ass?\\u201d Thought about doing a reach around to shove it back in for another try later but decided that would be a bad idea.

Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him.

BATEMAN  Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the  nail gun.  JEAN  Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?  Jean puts her spoon down on the table.  BATEMAN  (Looking up from loading nails into the gun)  What...No! Put it in the carton.  JEAN  Sorry.  (She puts the spoon in the carton)  BATEMAN  Jean? What?  JEAN  Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?  From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and stands behind the couch.  BATEMAN  I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just  want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.  JEAN  Hmmmm.   He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head. The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun  behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman  listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.  He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she  listens to the message.  EVELYN  Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.  What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope  you're not out with some little number you picked up because  you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never  called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for  Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with  Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,  auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell  Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!  You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.  Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.  JEAN  Was that...Evelyn?  Silence.  JEAN  Are you still seeing her?  Silence.  JEAN  I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.  Silence.  JEAN  Do you want me to go?  A long pause.  BATEMAN  Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.  JEAN  I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get  involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you  want me to go?  Another long pause.  BATEMAN  If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I  think I might hurt you.  (Almost hopefully)  You don't want to get hurt, do you?  JEAN  No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.  You're right, I should go.  She gets up to leave.  JEAN  And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with  Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.  BATEMAN  Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.  He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY   Bateman enters P&amp;P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside  the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with  Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for  a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting  the door behind him.  BATEMAN  Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come  into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?  Jean looks flustered.  Kimball follows Bateman into his office.  KIMBALL  I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's  taken a leave of absence.  BATEMAN  Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  (Hopefully)  Is he a suspect?  KIMBALL  Not really.  A pause.  KIMBALL  Do you remember where you were on the night of  Paul's disappearance?  (He checks his notebook)  Which was on the twentieth of December?  BATEMAN  God...I guess...I was probably returning  videotapes.  He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his  diary.  BATEMAN  I had a date with a girl named Veronica.  KIMBALL  Wait. That's not what I've got.  BATEMAN  What?  KIMBALL  That's not the information I've received.  BATEMAN  Well...I...Wait...What information have  you received?  KIMBALL  Let's see... (He flips through his notebook)  That you were with-  BATEMAN  Well, I could he wrong.  KIMBALL  Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?  BATEMAN  (Clearly nervous and under pressure)  We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It  was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner  at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I  physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't  remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.  Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens  his briefcase to put away his notebook.  KIMBALL  Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.  BATEMAN  Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long  day-a bit scattered.  KIMBALL  Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch  in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?  BATEMAN  Great, yes, I'd like that.  KIMBALL  And if you could try and pin down where you were  the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a  lot easier.  BATEMAN  Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.  Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a  new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.  KIMBALL  Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I  just bought it on my way here.  Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.  BATEMAN  Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.  KIMBALL  Not a big music fan, eh?  BATEMAN  No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.  KIMBALL  Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll  call your secretary about reservations.  BATEMAN  I'll be there.  EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT  The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.  The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a  half-opened window.  CHRISTIE  I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after  last time...  BATEMAN  Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.  CHRISTIE  I don't think so.  He hands her a $500 bill.  BATEMAN  Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.   The driver's here, you'll be safe.  Christie gets in hesitantly.  BATEMAN  Nothing like last time, promise.  CHRISTIE  Alright.  He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.  BATEMAN  (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)  So, you're looking great, how have you been?  CHRISTIE  (A little confused)  Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.  BATEMAN  (Mock shock)  Really?  CHRISTIE  My friend told me I should maybe even get a  lawyer.  BATEMAN  Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.  He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to  her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets  quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.  BATEMAN  Bitch.  He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge  wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to  lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the  limo, she reaches for the money.  He snatches it away.  BATEMAN  Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.  She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.  BATEMAN  Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,  Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.  You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything  about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?  Christie nods.  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped  down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an  attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.  Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to  examine a CD.  ELIZABETH  You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?  Christie shakes her head.  The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and  putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth  is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.  ELIZABETH  I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?  Christie looks blank.  ELIZABETH  Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.  Christie still blank.  ELIZABETH  You know, Au Bar?  Christie shakes her head.  ELIZABETH  Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.  Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses. Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at  the floor. There is an awkward silence.  CHRISTIE  This is nicer than your other apartment.  BATEMAN  (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)  It's not that nice.  Silence.  CHRISTIE  Where did you two meet?  ELIZABETH  Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,  '87, and... (Turning to Patrick)  You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.  (Sarcastically)  Hot number.  BATEMAN  What do you mean, she was a hot number.  ELIZABETH  If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  (To Christie)  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?  A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.   BATEMAN  She's my...cousin.   ELIZABETH  (Skeptically)  Uh huh?   BATEMAN She's from...France.  A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.   ELIZABETH  Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.  Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares  At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.   ELIZABETH  Where do you summer? Southampton?  Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.  CHRISTIE  No.  ELIZABETH  (Listening to the receiver)  Oh God, it's his machine.  BATEMAN  Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.  ELIZABETH  He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.  BATEMAN  Don't tell him you're here.  ELIZABETH  Why would I?  Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the whole glass, making a face.  ELIZABETH  This tastes weird.  (She examines the label and shrugs) Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway  you'd like. I'm at-  BATEMAN  (Whispering)  You're at Paul Owen s.  ELIZABETH  Who?  BATEMAN  (Whispering)  Paul Owen.  ELIZABETH  I want the number, idiot.  (She waves him away and continues into the reciever)  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I  don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my  hairdresser on you.  She hangs up.  ELIZABETH  Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce  &amp; Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?  BATEMAN  No.  ELIZABETH  Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.  Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her  another glass of the drugged wine.  BATEMAN  Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.  What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.  ELIZABETH  (Laughing)  Patrick, you re a lunatic.  BATEMAN  Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?  ELIZABETH  Let's not get lewd.  (Flirty)  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.  BATEMAN  Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.  ELIZABETH  (To Christie)  Does he do this all the time?  Christie shrugs.  BATEMAN  Christie, you're not drinking your wine.  Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.  BATEMAN  (To Elizabeth)  Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?  ELIZABETH  No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?  BATEMAN  Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.  ELIZABETH  Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me  feel weird.  LATER:  Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making  out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,  showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.  BATEMAN  Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP  called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles  on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps  across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's  mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album  on a first listening.  ELIZABETH  You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You  actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?  She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.  BATEMAN  (Ignoring her)  It's hard to choose a favorite track  among so many great ones, but \\\"The Greatest Love of All\\\"  is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about  self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message  crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope  that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.  Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in  to empathize with others, we can always empathize with  ourselves.  As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD  in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and  watches it slide into the machine.  BATEMAN  It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's  beautifully stated on the album.  INT. BEDROOM - LATER   AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and  Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.  CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by  the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an  incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are  moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against  flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are  shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional  performance, turning her head every so often to check the  progress of her partners.  OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,  moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then  shifts to actual pain.  Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind  Christie. There is blood on his face.  Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps  off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the  mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split  second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.  We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.  Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening  doors, looking for an escape.  She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.  She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the  door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,  then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE  DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.  She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by  the light from a television set. Through the darkness she  sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.  She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the  main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then  runs.  Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,  spattered with blood.  Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at  her, bellowing.  They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.  Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the  bathtub.  Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.  Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He  tries to bite it.  She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the  front door.  He runs after her.  BATEMAN  Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you  piece of bitch trash!  Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.  Bateman runs after her.  She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.  She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the  buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.  Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.  She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.  He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims  the chainsaw at her and drops it.  Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.  FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown  at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of  her back like a sword.  INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING   An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper  tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary  colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.  Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on  the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the  chainsaw in her back.  EVELYN  I want a firm commitment.  BATEMAN  I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.  Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.  EVELYN  (Distracted)  Why? What's wrong?  BATEMAN  (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)  My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale  cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill  my needs.  The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.  BATEMAN  We need to talk.  EVELYN  Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk  about?  BATEMAN  It's over, Evelyn. It's all over  EVELYN  (Motioning to the waiter for water)  Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just  avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?  BATEMAN  I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This  is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.  EVELYN  But your friends are my friends. My friends are your  friends. I don't think it would work.  (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)  You have a little something on your upper lip.  BATEMAN  (Brushing her hand away)  I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about  that. You can have them.  Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a  realization dawning.  EVELYN  You're really serious, aren't you?  BATEMAN  Yes, I am.  EVELYN  But what about the past? Our past?  BATEMAN  We never really shared one.  EVELYN  You're inhuman.  BATEMAN  I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  (He pauses, as if searching for the right words)  You're just not terribly important to me.  Evelyn begins to cry.  EVELYN  No, no, no.  BATEMAN  I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.  She reaches desperately across the table and takes his  hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.  EVELYN  (Sobbing)  What do you want me to do, what is it you want?  The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.  BATEMAN  (Looking uncomfortably around the room)  If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making  this scene right now.  EVELYN  Oh God, I can't believe this.  BATEMAN  I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.  Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the  tears so they will not affect her make-up.  EVELYN  (Surprisingly calm)  Where are you going?  BATEMAN  I'm just leaving.  EVELYN  But where?  BATEMAN  I have to return some videotapes.  He rushes out of the room.  EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING   Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.  BATEMAN  Here kitty, kitty.  The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and  walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in  the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT. Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the  deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He  takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the  kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.  WOMAN  Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?  Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming  to the floor.  Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the  distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car  screeches after him.  COP CAR (O.S.) HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.  Bateman ducks down an alley.  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT   A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from  out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away  from him.  Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of  them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He  reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.  He runs out of the alley.  EXT. STREET - NIGHT  As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS approaching.  COP CAR  Halt. Put down your weapon.  The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.  Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.  Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the  police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light  up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living  and dead.  NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows  him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each  one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS. THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.  NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a  tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,  the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.  INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT   He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.  NIGHT WATCHMAN  Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You  forgot to sign in.  Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the  revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he  notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He  revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.  NEW ANGLE:   He runs out of the building and across the  street to an identical office building, the one that houses  Pierce &amp; Pierce.  INT. PIERCE &amp; PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT   Bateman nods at the Pierce &amp; Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs  in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close  behind him.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT   Bateman stands looking out  through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view  of the city and the river.  Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the  opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares  everywhere, distant sirens.  Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,  he drops to the floor behind his desk.  Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating  Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.  He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into  the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.  BATEMAN  Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my  lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of  people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some  homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in  Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'  Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail  gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I  killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost  got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I  can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed  Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving  in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything  out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes  of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.  Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not  sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess  I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show  up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.  Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight  circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises  up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the  sky.  INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY   KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.  KIMBALL  (Very surprised)  No hash browns?   BATEMAN  Not in the mood, I guess.  KIMBALL  But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I  mean- it's-have you been here before?  BATEMAN  (Deliberately nonchalant)  Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.  KIMBALL  (Looking at him like he's nuts)  Suit yourself, I guess.  Pause.  KIMBALL  So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on  what you did?  BATEMAN  I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some  sorbet?  KIMBALL  I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.  BATEMAN  But how? Where do you place Paul that night?  KIMBALL  According to his date book, and this was verified by his  secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.  BATEMAN  And?  KIMBALL  I've questioned him.  BATEMAN  Marcus?  KIMBALL  Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't  be sure.  BATEMAN  But Marcus denied it?  KIMBALL  Yes.  BATEMAN  Well, does Marcus have an alibi?  KIMBALL  Yes.  A pause.  BATEMAN  He does? You're sure?  KIMBALL  (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean.  BATEMAN  Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?  (He laughs)   BATEMAN  (Laughing with him)  Where was Marcus?   KIMBALL  He wasn't with Paul  Owen.   BATEMAN  So who was he with?   KIMBALL  He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,  Harry Newman, George Butner and \\u2013  (He pauses, Then looks up)  - you.  A moment of stunned silence.  BATEMAN  Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen  to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner  with Victoria...the following night.   KIMBALL  Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for  a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.  Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or  later.  (A pause)  I mean, to think that one of his friends  killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too  ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?   McDermott stops by the table.   McDERMOTT  KIMBALL! How's the investigation?  Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.  (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)  Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?   Bateman looks at him in silence,  panicking.   McDERMOTT  You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky  without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a  raving maniac. Been at Pierce &amp; Pierce too long.  (He wanders off muttering)  No fucking hash browns...  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY  Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He  has a surgical mask in one hand.  DOORMAN  What can I do for you, sir?  BATEMAN  20B.  DOORMAN  Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.  BATEMAN  Mrs. Wolfe?  DOORMAN  The real estate agent? You do have an appointment, don't you?  Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly  painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English  country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There  are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands  admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman  wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops  at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He  opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.  Wolfe approaches, smiling.  MRS. WOLFE  Are you my two o'clock?  BATEMAN  No.  Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the  surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.  MRS. WOLFE  Can I help you?  BATEMAN I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.  She stares at him impassively.  BATEMAN  Doesn't he live here?  MRS. WOLFE  No, he doesn't.  BATEMAN  Are you sure?  MRS. WOLFE  You saw the ad in the Times?  BATEMAN  No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?  MRS. WOLFE  There was no ad in the Times.  Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.  MRS. WOLFE  I think you should go now.  BATEMAN  But I think...I want to know what happened  here.  MRS. WOLFE  Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.  Bateman backs away slowly.  MRS. WOLFE  Don't come back.  BATEMAN  I won't...don't worry.  Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,  rattled, and gets into the elevator.  EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY   Bateman enters the revolving  door of an office building, panicking and breathing  heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks  deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes  out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY  just like him.  GUY  Hey, Kinsley.  Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.  GUY  See you at Fluties, okay?  The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down  the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage  cans, etc.  EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY   Bateman searches his pockets  for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows  them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his  face, dialing a number.  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick Bateman's office.  BATEMAN  Jean? Hello? Jean?  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick? Is that you?  BATEMAN  Hello? Jean, I need help!  JEAN (O.S.) Where are you?  BATEMAN  Jean-I'm not-  JEAN (O.S.)  Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and  David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.  BATEMAN  Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick? I can't hear you.  BATEMAN  What are I doing?  JEAN (O.S.)  Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?  BATEMAN  I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.  Pause.  BATEMAN  ...to the office this afternoon.  JEAN (O.S.)  Why?  BATEMAN  (Screaming)  Just...say...no!  JEAN (O.S.)  What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?  BATEMAN  Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!  He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck  into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his  jacket.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY   Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens  his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.  INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING   Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the  previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking  and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,  still breathing heavily.  Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.  McDERMOTT  Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough  day at the office?  They all laugh.  McDERMOTT  Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking  Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't  get a reservation to save his life.  Bateman sits down silently.  McDERMOTT  Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.  BATEMAN  (On automatic)  I'm not going anywhere unless we  have a reservation.  VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,  faggots-just get a res.  PRICE  Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.  Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.   BATEMAN  (He downs his drink)  Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.   CARNES  Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the  end of the '90s.  Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.  BATEMAN  Shut up, Carnes, they will not.  Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.  BATEMAN  So, Harold, did you get my message?  Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.  CARNES  Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,  wasn't it?  BATEMAN  (Waving smoke out of his face)  Yes, naturally.  CARNES  Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s  fabulous. That's rich...  Pause  CARNES  It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?  BATEMAN  What exactly do you mean?  CARNES  The message you left.  Carnes is distracted, waving at people.  CARNES  By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still  seeing her, right?  BATEMAN  But wait, Harold, what do you mean?  Carnes isn't really listening.  CARNES  Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?  He turns to go.  BATEMAN  Carnes? Wait.  CARNES  (Sighing)  Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.  But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,  such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully  appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said  Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's  have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.  BATEMAN  What are you talking about? Bateman is what?  CARNES  Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let  alone...what was it you said he did to her?  Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing  couple. He laughs politely.  CARNES  Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...  BATEMAN  (Desperate, shouting)  Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really  comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.  I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.  I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your  machine was true.  CARNES  Excuse me. I really must he going.  BATEMAN  No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm  Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!  Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.  Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.  BATEMAN  Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed  Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer  CARNES  But that's simply not possible. And I don't find  this funny anymore.  BATEMAN  It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?  CARNES  (Eyeing Bateman worriedly) It's just not.  BATEMAN  Why not, you stupid bastard?  Carnes stares at him.  CARNES  Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in  London...just ten days ago.  BATEMAN  No, you...didn't?  CARNES  Now, if you'll excuse me.  Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze. They are all looking at the television, where Ronald  Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are  halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's  lying.  PRICE  How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?  VAN PATTEN  What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?  I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have  reservations somewhere.  PRICE  (To Bateman)  I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.  McDERMOTT  He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that  shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,  what can I say?  PRICE  I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that  way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so  fucking, I don't know, cool about it?  VAN PATTEN  Some guys are just born cool, I guess.  Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.  PRICE  And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?  BATEMAN  I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.  Working for UNICEF now?  McDERMOTT  Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?  PRICE  Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless  Old codger. But inside...  Pause.  PRICE  But inside...  The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:  BATEMAN (V.O.)  But inside doesn't matter...  THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.  McDERMOTT  (Bored) Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually  listening to you.  PRICE  Bateman? Come on, what do you think?   Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.  BATEMAN  Whatever.  The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.   VAN PATTEN  Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.  The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs  over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of  other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing,  BATEMAN (V.O.) There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with  the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,  all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward  it, I have now surpassed...  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY  Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.  We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with  doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost  and frightened, and begins to cry.  BATEMAN (V.O.) My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better  world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on  others. I want no escape.  INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING  As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is  leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,  his eyes blank.  BATEMAN (V.O.) But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no  deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted  from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any  of this. This confession has meant nothing...  The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:  \\\"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.\\\"  CREDITS ROLL\",\n",

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.  KIMBALL  Would you rather I not smoke?  BATEMAN  No, I guess it's okay.  KIMBALL  You sure?  BATEMAN  No problem.  (Buzzing Jean)  JEAN (O.S.)  Yes, Patrick?  BATEMAN  Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.  KIMBALL  What can you tell me about Paul Owen?  BATEMAN  Well...  He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows  them dry.  KIMBALL  How well did you know him?  BATEMAN  I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,  you know.  KIMBALL  Yale thing?  A pause.  BATEMAN  Yeah...Yale thing.  KIMBALL  What do you mean...Yale thing?  A pause.  BATEMAN  Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet  homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.  A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner  becomes deafening.  KIMBALL  So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul  Owen?  BATEMAN  He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.  KIMBALL  What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile)  the information you've just given.  BATEMAN  I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.  KIMBALL  Do you feel that way?  BATEMAN  No. Not really.  KIMBALL  (As he writes without looking up)  Where did Paul hang out?  BATEMAN  Hang...out?  KIMBALL  Yeah. You know...hang out.  BATEMAN  Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular  places.  KIMBALL  He had a yacht?  BATEMAN  No, he just hung out there.  KIMBALL  And where did he go to school?  A slight pause.  BATEMAN  Don't you know this?  KIMBALL  I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN  Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.  KIMBALL  I understand.  He makes another note.  KIMBALL  Anything else you can tell me about Owen?  BATEMAN  We were both seven in 1969.  KIMBALL  (Smiles)  So was I.  BATEMAN  Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?  KIMBALL  Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he  went to London.  BATEMAN  Well, maybe he did, huh?  KIMBALL  His girlfriend doesn't think so.  BATEMAN  But...has anyone seen him in London?  KIMBALL  Actually, yes.  BATEMAN  Hmmm.  KIMBALL  Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.  A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but  I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert  Ainsworth for Paul, so...  BATEMAN  Oh.  KIMBALL  Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?  BATEMAN  What?  KIMBALL  I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I  know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't  know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was  recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano  girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-  BATEMAN  Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced  diet and-  KIMBALL  Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.  A pause - the longest so far.  BATEMAN  Have you consulted a psychic?  KIMBALL  No.  BATEMAN  Had his apartment been burglarized?  KIMBALL  No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A  suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.  BATEMAN  I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet  or anything, right?  KIMBALL  No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.  BATEMAN  That's so typical, isn't it?  KIMBALL  It's just strange.  (He stares out the window, lost in thought)  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,  and then...  BATEMAN  Nothing.  KIMBALL  People just...disappear.  BATEMAN  The earth just opens up and swallows people.  (He checks his Rolex)  KIMBALL  Eerie. Really eerie.  Silence.  BATEMAN  (Standing up)  You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting  with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.  KIMBALL  Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I  mean aren't you going to be late?  BATEMAN  Uh, no. There's one...down here.  KIMBALL  Oh really? I didn't know that.  Bateman leads him to the door.  BATEMAN  Yes. It's very good.  KIMBALL turns to face him.  KIMBALL  Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information  at all...  BATEMAN  Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.  KIMBALL  Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.  Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his  eyes and leans against the door, sweating.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON   A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,  a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect  green grapes, a few berries.  OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard  from the living room.  The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal  crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw  Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,  next to a copy of GQ.  LATER:  Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,  jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.  BATEMAN  You like that, slut?  The person on the other end clearly hangs up.  CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.  BATEMAN  You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar  boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white  cotton T-shirt by  Commes des Garcons.  (He snorts like a pig)  My Rolex cost-  Another hang-up. He dials again.  BATEMAN  (Whipering)  I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do  you think of that?  (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)  Huh, bitch?  GIRL (O.S.) Dad, is that you?  Bateman hangs up, frustrated.  EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT   Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside  CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.  Bateman opens his window to speak to her.  BATEMAN  I haven't seen you around here.  CHRISTIE  You just haven't been looking.  BATEMAN  Would you like to see my apartment?  Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a  tuxedo.  CHRISTIE  (looking away to some dark corner)  I'm not supposed to.  Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now  notices, then takes.  BATEMAN  Do you want to come to my apartment or not?  CHRISTIE  I'm not supposed to.  (She pockets the bill)  But I can make an exception.  BATEMAN  Do you take American Express?  Christie is still looking out behind her.  BATEMAN  Do you take American Express?  Christie looks at him like he's crazy.  BATEMAN  I'm joking. Come on, get in.  As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He  reads off a credit card number.  BATEMAN  I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does  couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the  American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really  can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.  He hangs up.  BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?  You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is  that clear?  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white  milky bath oil.  BATEMAN  That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.  Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and  Bateman is casually touching her breast.  BATEMAN  I want you to clean your vagina.  Christie reaches for a washcloth.  BATEMAN  No. From behind. Get on your knees.  Christie shrugs.  BATEMAN  I want to watch. You have a very nice body.  The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.  BATEMAN  Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry  off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and  our guest in the living room for drinks.  Bateman answers the door.  BATEMAN  You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.  I'm Paul. How good of you to come.  The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes  her coat and inspects her body and face.  BATEMAN  Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm  going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.  Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a  glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the  couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a  long silence.  BATEMAN  So, don't you want to know what I do?  The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.  Christie shrugs.  CHRISTIE  No.  SABRINA  (Smiling)  No, not really.  Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.  BATEMAN  Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce &amp; Pierce.  (Long pause)  Have you heard of it?  Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands  up and goes over to the CD collection.  CHRISTIE  You have a really nice place here...Paul.  How much did you pay for it?  BATEMAN  Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,  hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.  Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a  pack of cigarettes out of her purse. Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.  BATEMAN  No, no smoking. Not in here.  He walks over to Christie.  BATEMAN  Varda truffle?  Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina  takes one.  BATEMAN  I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very  fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.  Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.  He takes one out and examines it.  BATEMAN  Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis  fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before  that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too  artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'  presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out  another one.  BATEMAN  I think \\\"Invisible Touch\\\" is the group's undisputed masterpiece.  He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him  into the bedroom.  BATEMAN  It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the  same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding  three albums. Christie, take off the robe.  Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to  put it on.  BATEMAN  Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,  Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance  of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.  Bateman starts to undress.  BATEMAN  In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer  songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?  Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.  BATEMAN  Take the lyrics to \\\"Land of Confusion.\\\" In this  song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political  authority.  Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather  menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.   BATEMAN  \\\"In Too Deep\\\" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about  monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.  Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything  I've heard in rock.  He turns on the video camera.   BATEMAN  Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your  asshole.  Bateman looks through the viewfinder.  BATEMAN  Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and  therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially  songs like \\\"In the Air Tonight\\\" and \\\"Against  All Odds.\\\" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.   He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in  the CD.  BATEMAN  But I also think that Phill Collins works better  within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and  I stress the word artist. This is \\\"Sussudio,\\\" a great,  great song, a personal favorite.  SEX MONTAGE CUT TO \\\"Sussudio.\\\" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or  through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.  CUT TO:   Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina  on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his  wrist. Bateman's eyes open.  BATEMAN  Don't touch the Rolex.  Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.  He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,  a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns  around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up  and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.  BATEMAN  We're not through yet...  CUT TO:  Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They  are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a  deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the  b.g. Phil Collins' \\\"In the Air Tonight\\\" is playing.  INT. YALE CLUB \\u2013 DAY   McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are  having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and  gives them the finger.  BATEMAN  What an asshole.  McDERMOTT  Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a  fucking drug addict. No self-control.  VAN PATTEN  But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do  you think, Bateman?  BATEMAN  I know her. I knew her.  McDERMOTT  Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it  like that?  VAN PATTEN  Because he dated her.  BATEMAN  How did you guess?  VAN PATTEN  Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,  Bateman.  BATEMAN  Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy  personality.  McDERMOTT  So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a  babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other  reason.  VAN PATTEN  If they have a good personality, then something  is very wrong.  McDERMOTT  If they have a good personality and they are not  great looking-who fucking cares?  BATEMAN  Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if  they have a good personality?  (He smiles giving up)  I know, I know-  ALL IN UNISON There are no girls with good personalities!  (They laugh and high-five each other)  VAN PATTEN  A good personality consists of a chick with a  little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without  being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep  her dumb fucking mouth  shut.  McDERMOTT  Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even  talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly  chicks.  VAN PATTEN  Absolutely.  McDERMOTT  And this is because they have to make up for how  fucking unattractive they are.  Pause.  BATEMAN  Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?  VAN PATTEN  Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?  BATEMAN  No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was  an interesting guy.  McDERMOTT  So what did Ed say?  BATEMAN  He said, \\\"When I see a pretty girl walking down the  street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her  out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat  her right.\\\"  Pauses, finishes his drink.  McDERMOTT  What does the other part of him think?  BATEMAN  What her head would look like on a stick.  McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back  at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily join In.  Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.  CARRUTHERS  (Shyly)  Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.  McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.  McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you  know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.  CARRUTHERS  Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to  get a new one too.  He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone  compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear  is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.  Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with  himself.  VAN PATTEN  Listen, what about dinner?  BATEMAN  (Suddenly angry)  Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? \\\"What about  fucking dinner?\\\"   McDERMOTT  Ah, cheer up, Bateman.  (Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)  What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?   BATEMAN  (Watching Luis going into the men's room)  Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.  McDERMOTT  Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.  BATEMAN  Excuse me.  He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van  Patten grabs a waiter.  VAN PATTEN  Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring  me an Evian or something, okay?  INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY   Bateman pulls on his gloves as he  enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his  back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman  approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands  up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his  neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear  is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to  squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.  Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in  thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's  wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck  expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side  of his face.  CARRUTHERS  God, Patrick. Why here?  He strokes Bateman's hair.  CARRUTHERS  I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.  Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs  away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers  immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops  them again.  CARRUTHERS  Don't be shy.  Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift  his hands again, but abandons the attempt.  CARRUTHERS  You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas  party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that  red-striped paisley Armani tie.  Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are  still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and  stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he  realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up  behind him.  CARRUTHERS  I want you. I want you...too.  Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter  and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'  and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,  Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at  them. Carruthers walks up behind him.  BATEMAN  (Hissing)  What...is...it?  CARRUTHERS  Where are you going?  BATEMAN  (Stumbling away from him)  I've gotta...I've  gotta...return some videotapes.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick?  BATEMAN  What? CARRUTHERS  (Silently mouthing the words)  I'll call you.  Bateman storms out of the restaurant.  INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.  Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels  something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,  a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.  COURTNEY  Will you call me before Thanksgiving?  BATEMAN  Maybe.  Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her  nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins  to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches  the TV at low volume.  COURTNEY  What are you doing tonight?  BATEMAN  Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.  COURTNEY  That's nice.  BATEMAN  You and...Luis?  COURTNEY  (Lighting a cigarette)  We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and  Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...  BATEMAN  I never knew you smoked.  COURTNEY  (Smiling sadly)  You never noticed.  Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.  COURTNEY  Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?  BATEMAN  You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're  going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.  COURTNEY  (Sarcastically)  Isn't that special?  (A pause)  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Yes, Courtney?  C0URTNEY  If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?  BATEMAN  (Flatly)  You too.  Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its  head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.  COURTNEY  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Yes?  COURTNEY  Nothing.  INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT   A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop  kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.  I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and  tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a  suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.  KIMBALL  Mr. Bateman?  Bateman gasps and recovers.  BATEMAN  Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL  Kimball.  (Extending his hand)  Call me Don.  BATEMAN  Don.  KIMBALL  So...you hang out here a lot?  BATEMAN  Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You  know.  Pause.  BATEMAN  How's the investigation going? Taken anyone  in for \\\"formal questioning?\\\" (He makes quotation marks  in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)  KIMBALL  0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?  BATEMAN  Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.  KIMBALL  (Looking at his glass)  Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much  more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,  don't you think?  Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.  KIMBALL  Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?  Bateman shakes his head.  KIMBALL  I mean they want to get caught.  BATEMAN  Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need  anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean  Owen was a...complex man.  Bateman wanders away.  He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from  the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.  BATEMAN  (Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!  The man stares at him.  BATEMAN  I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...  The man walks by, shaking his head.  Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a  more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in  black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott  and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black  mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered  argument.  PRICE  I have to talk to these girls? They're models.  McDERMOTT  Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.  You went last time. Stay here.  McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears. Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring  into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to  unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.  PRICE  (Clapping his hands together)  Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?  Silence.  LIBBY  Where did Craig go?  PRICE  Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to  sign a peace treaty with him between the United States  and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.  LIBBY  Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.  PRICE  You're not confused, are you?  LIBBY  No, not really.  CARON  Gorbachev's not downstairs.  DAISY  (Smiling)  Are you Iying?  PRICE  Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's  at Tunnel.  BATEMAN  (To Daisy)  Ask me a question.  DAISY  So, what do you do?  BATEMAN  What do you think I do?  DAISY  A model? An actor?  BATEMAN  No. Flattering, but no.  DAISY  Well...  BATEMAN  I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.  DAISY (Unfazed)  Do you like it?  BATEMAN  Welt...it depends, why?  DAISY  Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and  acquisitions don't really like it.  Silence.  BATEMAN  So, where do you work out?  MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:   The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a  balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him  in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over  the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman  is reaching for him.  PRICE  (Shouting) I'm leaving. I'm getting out.  BATEMAN  Leaving what?  PRICE  This.  Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his  drink.  BATEMAN  Don't, I'll drink it.  PRICE  (Screaming)  Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.  BATEMAN  Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?  PRICE  I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!  BATEMAN  Don't tell me...merchant banking?  PRICE  No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm  disappearing.  BATEMAN  (laughing)  Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?  Price looks away.  McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.  McDERMOTT  Hey-don't worry, be happy.  Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is  shouting something that can't be heard, then  PRICE  Goodbye! Fuckheads!  He climbs over the railing.  DAISY What is he doing?  BATEMAN  Price! Come back!  Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment  then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.  EXT. CLUB - NIGHT  Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.  DAISY  My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays  in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand  what I was doing with a yuppie.  BATEMAN  Oh really? DAISY  He said... (She laughs)  He said you gave him bad vibes.  BATEMAN  That's...that's too bad.  DAISY  You think I'm dumb, don't you?  BATEMAN  What?  DAISY  You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.  BATEMAN  (insincerely) No. I really don't.  DAISY  That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.  She takes his hand as they get into a cab.  INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT   Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses  in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the  case.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON   Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York  Times crossword puzzle at dusk.  Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with  a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.  JEAN  Doin' the crossword?  Bateman nods without looking up.  JEAN  Need help?  BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the  puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean  drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.  BATEMAN  Jean?  JEAN  (Re-enters office)  Yes, Patrick?  BATEMAN  Would you like to accompany me to dinner?  He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.  BATEMAN  That is...if you're not doing anything.  JEAN  Oh no. I have no plans.  BATEMAN  (Lowering his Wayfarers)  Well, isn't this a coincidence.  A pause.  BATEMAN  Listen, where should we go?  He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.  JEAN  Anywhere you want?  BATEMAN  Let's not think about what I want. How about  anywhere you want.  JEAN  Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.  BATEMAN  No, come on. Anywhere you want.  JEAN  Oh, I can't.  (Sighs)  I don't know.  BATEMAN  Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.  A long pause.  JEAN  What about...Dorsia?  Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles  at her.  BATEMAN  Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...  JEAN  Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.  BATEMAN  Dorsia is...fine.  He dials the number.  MAITRE D' Dorsia, yes?  BATEMAN  Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at  nine o'clock?  He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.  MAITRE D' We are totally booked.  BATEMAN  Oh really? That's great.  MAITRE D'  I said we are totally booked.  BATEMAN  Two at nine? Perfect.  MAITRE D'  There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is  also totally booked.  BATEMAN  See you then.  He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He  glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the  desk, confused.  BATEMAN  Yes? You're dressed...okay.  JEAN  You didn't give them a name.  BATEMAN  They know me.  Pause.  BATEMAN  Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock  for drinks, okay?  She turns to leave.  BATEMAN  And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING   Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.  JEAN  Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.  Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady  visible.  BATEMAN  Jean? Sorbet?  JEAN  Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.  Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in  his hand and hands her the sorbet.  Jean is eating the sorbet.  JEAN  Want a bite?  BATEMAN  I'm on a diet. But thank you.  JEAN  You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?  You look great. Very fit.  BATEMAN  (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)  You can always he thinner. Look...better.  JEAN  Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't  want to ruin your willpower.  BATEMAN  No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling  it anyway.  Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up  his knife drawer, looking at the knives.  BATEMAN  So listen, what do you really want to do with your  life?  Pause.  BATEMAN  And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,  okay?  JEAN  Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,  but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life  where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.  Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge  of the blade.  BATEMAN  Do you have a boyfriend?  JEAN  No, not really.  BATEMAN  Interesting.  JEAN  (Shyly)  Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?  BATEMAN  Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very  Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,  twine and a nail gun.  BATEMAN  Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?  JEAN  Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused  on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about  changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.  BATEMAN  Growing. I'm glad you said that.  Bateman picks up the duct tape.\",\n",

But this is TOTALLY different than any horror game that I've ever played.

STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT   It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the  comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.  Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk  past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his  wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up  to her as she pauses at a red light.  BATEMAN  Hello.  The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing  his smile, smiles back.  INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY   Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit  with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry  cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the  counter.  BATEMAN  Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons.  The woman continues to speak to him in another language,  grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.  BATEMAN  What are you trying to say to me?  Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained  sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.  BATEMAN  Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?  Bleach-ee. Oh my God.  She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.  BATEMAN  (Talking over her)  Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.  Two. (Louder)  Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very  expensive sheets and I really need them clean.  She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.  BATEMAN  If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill  you, are you understanding me?  She talks faster.  BATEMAN  Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting  (Checks Rolex)  at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those  ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at  Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need  those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.  She keeps talking.  BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.  Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the  counter.  BATEMAN  This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with  this.  Bateman is on the verge of tears.  BATEMAN  Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!  Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,  late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a  tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.  VICTORIA  Patrick?  She takes off her sunglasses.  VICTORIA  Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.  BATEMAN  Hello  (Mumbles un incomprehensible name)  Awkward pause.  BATEMAN  Well.  VICTORIA  Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,  but you know. They really are the best.  BATEMAN  Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk  to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.  Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding  up. She touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking  again.  VICTORIA  Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my. BATEMAN  Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.  VICTORiA  (Skeptically) Really?  BATEMAN  Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You  know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?  VICTORIA  (As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.  Fun with chocolate.  BATEMAN  Listen, if you could talk to them  (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a  lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.  Bateman turns to leave.  VICTORIA  Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?  BATEMAN  Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank  you, uh... Victoria?  VICTORIA  Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You  know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.  BATEMAN  Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the  time.  VICTORIA  Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?  BATEMAN  (Checking his watch)  Next Saturday?  VICTORIA  (Shrugging)  Yeah.  BATEMAN  Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin\\u00e9e of Les Miserables.  Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call  you.  VICTORIA  Okay. Do.  Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes  out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound  of the bell on the closing door.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY  Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to  Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one  hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear  the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.  BATEMAN  Listen, what are you doing tonight?  COURTNEY  What? Oh, I'm...busy.  BATEMAN  Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,  and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to  tonight?  COURTNEY  Stop it. I'm...  BATEMAN  On a lot of lithium?  COURTNEY  Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call  tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.  BATEMAN  You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY  But-when?  BATEMAN  Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?  COURTNEY  Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I  need to be home for that.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin?  COURTNEY  Yes?  BATEMAN  Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.  COURTNEY  Uh huh.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New  York.  COURTNEY  I know. Stop it.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling  dickweed.  COURTNEY  Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.  BATEMAN  Courtney? Dinner?  COURTNEY  I can't.  BATEMAN  I'm thinking Dorsia.  COURTNEY  Dorsia's nice.  BATEMAN  Nice?  COURTNEY  You like it there, don't you?  BATEMAN  The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will  you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a  boyfriend to eat there tonight.  COURTNEY  Okay. Yeah. What time?  BATEMAN  Eight?   COURTNEY  Pick me up?   BATEMAN  Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear  something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?  Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the  number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so  he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with  his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there  is finally an answer.  MAITRE D' Dorsia. Please hold.  He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.  MAITRE D' Dorsia.  BATEMAN  (Both of his eyes are closed)  Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to  reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?  Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then  more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he  hangs up the phone.  INT. TAXI- NIGHT  Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is heavily medicated.  COURTNEY  A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really  relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this  silver muffin dish.  (She starts to pass out)  BATEMAN  Is that Donald Trump's car?  COURTNEY  (Thickly)  Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.  BATEMAN  You know, Courtney, you should take some more  lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you  out of this slump.  COURTNEY  I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... (Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)  The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads  \\\"Barcadia.\\\"  INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT   An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all  polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,  minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.  A waiter has come to take their drink orders.  BATEMAN J&amp;B. Straight.  COURTNEY  Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with  a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman  leans over and pulls her back up.  COURTNEY  Are we here?  BATEMAN  Yes.  COURTNEY  This is Dorsia?  BATEMAN  (Examining a menu that says \\\"Barcadia\\\" in large script)  Yes, dear.  Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and  starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both  shoulders and props her up.  BATEMAN  Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter  soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine  called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish.\\\" You'll  love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and  pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.   COURTNEY  Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.   She falls asleep at the table.  INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on  top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears  it open with his teeth, puts it on.  COURTNEY  (Dazed on lithium)  I want you to fuck me.  Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.  COURTNEY  Luis is a despicable twit.  BATEMAN  Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.  He keeps fucking her.  COURTNEY  No, you idiot. I said \\\"Is it a receptacle tip?\\\"  Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?  Get off me.  BATEMAN  Is it a what?  COURTNEY  Pull out.  BATEMAN  I'm ignoring you.  COURTNEY  (screaming)  Pull out, goddamnit!  BATEMAN  (Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney?  She pushes him away from her.  BATEMAN  It's a plain end. I think.  COURTNEY  Turn the light on.  She tries to sit up.  BATEMAN  Oh Jesus. I'm going home.  COURTNEY  Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.   BATEMAN  It's a plain end, see? So?   COURTNEY  Take it off.   BATEMAN  Why?   COURTNEY  Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip \\u2013  (She covers herself with her comforter)  to catch the force of the ejaculate!  BATEMAN  I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?  Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.   COURTNEY  (Screaming)  Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?  Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.  BATEMAN  Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,  Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  (He slaps her again lightly)  Why is it pulled down half an inch?  So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!  COURTNEY  (Choking crying)  Well, it's not a turn-on for me.  I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.  Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.  BATEMAN  See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?  COURTNEY  Oh God, just get it over with.  He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and  falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their  bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the  ceiling.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY  Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in  the conference room at Pierce &amp; Pierce, which looks out onto  a spectacular view of Manhattan.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a  reservation there?  BATEMAN  Lucky, I guess.  CARRUTHERS  That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,  Valentino Couture?  BATEMAN  Uh huh.  CARRUTHERS  (Reaching out to touch it)  It looks so soft.  BATEMAN  (Catching Luis hand)  Your compliment was sufficient Luis.  Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague  on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal  under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and  self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.  OWEN  (To Bateman)  Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?  BATEMAN  I've been great. And you?  Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's  thoughts.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.  It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P and in  fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a  penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.  Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have  a slightly better haircut.  During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS  HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the  opposite corner of the room. He bears a  superficial resemblance to Bateman.  OWEN  How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?  BATEMAN  (Nervous)  It's...it's...all right.  OWEN  Really? That's interesting.  (He stares at Bateman, smiling) Not great?  BATEMAN  Oh well, you know.  OWEN  And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.  BATEMAN  Oh yes. I'm very lucky.  McDermott and Price enter.  McDERMOTT  Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.  OWEN  Thank you, Baxter.  PRICE  Listen, Paul. Squash?  OWEN  Call me.  (Hands him a business card)  PRICE  How about Friday?  OWEN  No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea  urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away  and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.  CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.  PRICE (Whispering)  Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?  McDERMOTT (Whispering)  I think he's lying.  Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.   PRICE  (Suddenly enthused)  What's that, a gram?   BATEMAN  New card. What do you think?  McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.   McDERMOTT  Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.  He hands it to Van Patten.  BATEMAN  Picked them up from the printers yesterday  VAN PATTEN  Good coloring.  BATEMAN  That's bone. And the lettering is something called  Silian Rail.  McDERMOTT  (Envious)  Silian Rail?  VAN PATTEN  It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.  He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the  table.   VAN PATTEN  Look at this.  They all lean forward to inspect it.   PRICE  That's really nice.  Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to  control his anxiety.  VAN PATTEN  Eggshell with Romalian type.  (Turning to Bateman) What do you think?  BATEMAN  (Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)  Nice.  PRICE  (Holding the card up to the light)  Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so  tasteful?  Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at  McDermott's.   BATEMAN (V.O.) I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.  PRICE  But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.   He holds up his own card.   PRICE  Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...  BATEMAN  (Choking with anxiety)  Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.  Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it  up for their inspection: \\\"PAUL OWEN, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE,  MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.\\\" Bateman swallows, speechless.  The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint  heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness  of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...  His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it  until it fills the screen.  He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.  CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.  EXT. STREET- EVENING   The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.  Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of  $500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns  to leave, he notices someone across the street.  A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open  grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A  cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM  HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies  next to him.  He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green  polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.  BATEMAN  (Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.  The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.  BATEMAN  You want some money?. Some...food?  The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches  into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his  mind and holds out a $5 instead.  BATEMAN  Is this what you need?  The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  BATEMAN  It's cold out, too, isn't it?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  BATEMAN  (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)  Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you  get a job?  HOMELESS MAN  (Shivering and sobbing)  I lost my job...  BATEMAN  Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?  Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on  the job?  HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.  BATEMAN  Gee, uh, that's too bad.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  The dog starts to whimper.  BATEMAN  Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm not...  BATEMAN  You're not what? Qualified for anything else?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm hungry  BATEMAN  I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.  I'm trying to help you.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm hungry.  BATEMAN  Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who  do have jobs? From people who do work?  HOMELESS MAN  What am I gonna do?  BATEMAN  Listen, what's your name?  HOMELESS MAN Al.  BATEMAN  Speak up. Come on.  HOMELESS MAN Al.  BATEMAN  Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.  That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.  I'll help you.  HOMELESS MAN  You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.  BATEMAN  (Petting the dog)  Shhhh...it's okay.  HOMELESS MAN  (Grabbing Bateman's wrist)  Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.  BATEMAN  (Stroking his face, whispering)  Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.  HOMELESS MAN  I can't...I can't find a shelter  BATEMAN  You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of  faggot. Al...I'm sorry.  Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.  BATEMAN  It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common  with you.  He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with  a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to  protect it.  BATEMAN  Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?  HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.  EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach. The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is  silent.  LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.  BATEMAN There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.  Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.  Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the  body left twitching on the ground.  INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY   CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a  woman's hands rub cream into his face.  FACIALIST  What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So  fine, so smooth...  His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he  closes them again.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,  skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except  for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside  me and I don't know why.  CUT TO:  Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the  MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his  nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,  on the verge of frenzy.  CUT TO:  Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning  bed, wearing goggles.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.  INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT   An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an  ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets,  naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.  Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.  BATEMAN  Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?  MAITRE D' Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.  Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of  ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.  OWEN  No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro  crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one  could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the  way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten  people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of  cilantro crawfish gumbo?  WAITER  I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen  earlier today, and-  BATEMAN  J&amp;B, straight. And a Dixie beer.  WAITER  Would you like to hear-  OWEN  Double Absolut martini.  WAITER  Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?  BATEMAN  Not if you want to keep your spleen.  The Waiter leaves.  OWEN  This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.   This place is hot, very hot.  BATEMAN  Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous  here.  OWEN  Yeah, well, you're late.  BATEMAN  Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.  OWEN  We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.  BATEMAN  Nobody goes there anymore.  There is a long disgruntled silence.  BATEMAN  Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez  Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana  be at Texarkana?  Another pause.  BATEMAN  So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the  Fisher account? How did you get it?  OWEN  I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have  to kill you.  He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.  LATER:  Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.  BATEMAN  I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?  Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another  drink.  OWEN  Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?  BATEMAN Salon.  OWEN  I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.  Bateman nods, agitated.  OWEN  And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?  BATEMAN  Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think  she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.  OWEN  Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick  Bateman. What a dork.  BATEMAN  Another Martini, Paul?  Owen nods drunkenly.  LATER:  The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the  table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid  down.  BATEMAN  (Talking to Owen like a child)  Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.  BATEMAN  Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave  a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?  OWEN  No, man. I'm gonna bail.  BATEMAN  Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  (Helping him into his jacket)  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a  bottle of Absolut waiting for us.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The living room floor has been meticulously covered with  newspaper.  Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass  in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.  BATEMAN  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  OWEN  They're okay. BATEMAN  Their early work was a little too New Wave for my  taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really  came into their own, commercially and artistically.  Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. He takes two Valium.  BATEMAN  (Said partly from the bathroom)  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of  consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.  He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen  from behind ail the time.  BATEMAN  He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think  Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys  catalogue.  OWEN  Hey, Halberstam?  BATEMAN  Yes, Owen?  OWEN  Why are there copies of the Style section all over  the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?  BATEMAN  No, Owen.  OWEN  (Confused)  Is that a raincoat?  BATEMAN  Yes, it is.  Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its  case and slides it in the machine.  BATEMAN  In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most  accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is  \\\"HiP To Be Square,\\\" a song so catchy that most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not  just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of  trends. It's al\\\\~ a personal statement about the band itself.  Bateman puts on \\\"Hip To Be Square.\\\"  BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.  We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the  ax raised over his head.  BATEMAN  Hey, Paul?  As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing  the ax toward his face.  Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.  FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.  Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.  We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.  Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.  BATEMAN  (Raising the ax and screaming)  Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking  stupid bastard!  LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the  ax.  OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.  BATEMAN  (Panting)  Fucking bastard...  Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the  coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly  over the back of a chair.  He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He  checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.  OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.  INT. LOBBY - NIGHT   BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,  past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.  EXT. STREET - NIGHT  BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his  feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick? Is that you?  BATEMAN  No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.  CARRUTHERS  This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good  friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to  Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  (Looking down at the body)  Where did you get your overnight bag?  BATEMAN  Commes des Garcon.  A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get  Owen's body into the backseat.  Bateman gets into the cab.  CARRUTHERS  Call me please, Patrick.  BATEMAN  Jesus lives, Luis.  INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT   A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank  except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.  Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in  a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the  body dissolve.  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very  similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls  are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting  on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale  scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.  BATEMAN  Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?  He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing  toiletries and shoving them in.  BATEMAN  Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.  He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans  over the answering machine.  He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.  BATEMAN  Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London  for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.  Hasta la vista, baby.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING   Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of  Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing  Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes  the Walkman off.  BATEMAN  (Faintly irritable)  What is it?  JEAN  Patrick?  BATEMAN  (Condescendingly)  Ye-es, Je-an?  JEAN  Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.  BATEMAN  Who?  JEAN  Detective Donald KIMBALL?  Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the  drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back  cover of Sports Illustrated.  BATEMAN  Tell him I'm at lunch.  JEAN  (whispering)  Patrick, I think he knows you're here.  It's only ten-thirty.   Silence.   BATEMAN  Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless  phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.  BATEMAN  Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion  to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good  buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt  calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...  The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD  KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -  and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of  the type Bateman and his friends might wear.  Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a  self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to  carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at  him curiously, noticing the silence.  BATEMAN  (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)  Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.  Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in  exasperation.   KIMBALL nods understandingly.  BATEMAN  Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just  walked in... (He laughs inanely)  Just joking... (Pause)  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,  right, got it.  (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)  Sorry about that.  KIMBALL  No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  (Gesturing toward the phone)  Was that anything important?  BATEMAN  Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.  Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.  They laugh politely.  KIMBALL  (Holding out his hand)  Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL  BATEMAN  (Shaking firmly)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.  KIMBALL  I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed  to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,  you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.  KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports  Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.  Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines  into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is  still running.  BATEMAN  (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)  So, what's the topic of discussion?  KIMBALL  I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate  the disappearance of Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?  KIMBALL  Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.  BATEMAN  Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.  KIMBALL  So it's nothing that official. I just have some  basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-  BATEMAN  Coffee?  KIMBALL  No. I'm okay.  BATEMAN  Perrier? San Pellegrino?  KIMBALL  No, I'm okay.  KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold  Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes  Jean.  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Can you bring Mr...  KIMBALL  KIMBALL.  BATEMAN  Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-  KIMBALL  Oh no, I'm okay.  BATEMAN  It's no problem  Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down  in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters  and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched  glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.  He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.  BATEMAN  Well, what's the topic of discussion?  KIMBALL  The disappearance of Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the  disappearance or anything... (Trying to laugh)  Not on \\\"Page Six\\\" at least.  KIMBALL  I think his family wants this kept quiet.  BATEMAN  Understandable.  (Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)  Lime?  KIMBALL  No, really. I'm okay.  BATEMAN  You sure? I can always get you a lime.  A pause.  KIMBALL Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own  files, okay?  BATEMAN  Shoot.  KIMBALL  How old are you?  BATEMAN  Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.  KIMBALL  (Scribbling in his notebook)  Where did you go to school?  BATEMAN  Harvard. The Harvard Business School.  KIMBALL  Your address?  BATEMAN  Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.  KIMBALL  (Looking up, impressed)  Nice. Very nice.  BATEMAN  (Flattered)  Thanks.  A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his eyes, as if in pain.  KIMBALL  Pardon me, but are you okay?  BATEMAN  Who do you ask?  KIMBALL You seem...nervous.  Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a  bottle of aspirin.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"  \\n **AMERICAN PSYCHO**  by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner  Based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis   Fourth Draft  November 1998   INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT   An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.  The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged  silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths  decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous  exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and  confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:  pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala\\u00efa, Armani power suits.  CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.  WAITER  With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula  Caesar salad. For entr\\u00e9es tonight I have a swordfish  meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge  breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...  Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen  table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four  inches square and look exactly alike.  CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of  conversation. \\\"Is that Charlie Sheen over there?\\\" \\\"Excuse  me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.\\\"  WAITER  And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our  pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...  CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate  perpendicular desserts descending on another table.  PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID  VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing  expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back  hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.   The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:  BATEMAN (V.O.) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California  place on the Upper East Side.  The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately  decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's  description of each of the men at the table.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in  a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences  between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van  Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the  best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a  bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten  keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .   VAN PATTEN  What are the rules for a sweater vest?  McDERMOTT  What do you mean?  PRICE  Yes. Clarify.  McDERMOTT  Well, is it strictly informal-  BATEMAN  Or can it be worn with a suit?  McDERMOTT  (Smiling)  Exactly  BATEMAN  With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or  charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder  vest.  McDERMOTT  But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look  too studied.  VAN PATTEN  You think so?  PRICE  You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.  VAN PATTEN  Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.  Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy  discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.  BATEMAN  Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?  PRICE  It looks that way, doesn't it?  McDERMOTT  (Staring at retreating waiter)  Did he just take our plates away?  PRICE  He took them away because the portions are so small he  probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.  This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?  McDERMOTT  Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. (He guffaws)  Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.  McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.  McDERMOTT  Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE  Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.  McDERMOTT  Who is it then?  PRICE  That's Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.  He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back  hair and horn-rimmed glasses.  McDERMOTT  Who is he with?  PRICE  (Distracted by the waitress's  cleavage as she bends over to  uncork a bottle of wine \\u2013 the  waitress glares at him)  Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.  Van Patten returns.  VAN PATTEN  They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.  McDERMOTT  Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?  PRICE  Yes. McDufus, I am.  McDERMOTT  He's handling the Fisher account.  PRICE  Lucky bastard.  McDERMOTT  Lucky Jew bastard.  BATEMAN  Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with  anything?  McDERMOTT  Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The  bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.  BATEMAN  You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.  You spin a dreidel.  McDERMOTT  Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?  BATEMAN  No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.  McDERMOTT  Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the  ACLU.  Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.  PRICE  The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking  of reasonable...  He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.  McDERMOTT  Only $470.  VAN PATTEN  (Without irony)  Not bad.  The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap down on the table.  INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT  Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is  lighting up a cigar.  McDERMOTT  Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-  VAN PATTEN  Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this  story again.  McDERMOTT  But I never told you what happened afterwards. So  okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big  tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I  buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on  spring break and she's practically blowing me in the  Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-  BATEMAN  Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all  this?  McDERMOTT  Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick  who's gonna let me-  VAN PATTEN  (Putting his hands over his ears)  I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something  disgusting.  McDERMOTT  You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op  together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some  chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.  Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.  McDERMOTT  Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to  this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking  rhino tipsy, and get this-  VAN PATTEN  She let you fuck her without a condom?  McDERMOTT  This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She  would only-are you ready?  (Dramatic pause)  She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept  her glove on.  The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.  ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.  EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT  The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.  McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,  who looks confused.  McDERMOTT  I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask  him if he takes American Express.  PRICE  (Offering card)  You take Amex, dude?  The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,  unhooks the  velvet rope and welcomes them inside.  INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT   Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a  black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.  MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls  stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the  counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as  women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they  wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple  lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes  past them and slams the door.  PRICE  There's this theory out now that if you can catch the  AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,  then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular  dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for  Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-  BATEMAN  I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a  virus.  PRICE  Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.  Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is  sweating.  PRICE  I'm shaking. You open it.  Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.  PRICE Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?  BATEMAN  Maybe it's just the light.  PRICE  Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips  the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)  Oh my God...  BATEMAN  What?  PRICE  It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!  Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.  BATEMAN  It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do  enough of it we'll be okay.  PRICE  I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it  on my fucking All-Bran.  The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate  voice:  GUY IN STALL  Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!  Price pounds his fist against the stall.  PRICE  (screaming)  SHUT UP!  BATEMAN  Calm down. Let's do it anyway  PRICE  I guess you're right... (Raising his voice)  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!  GUY IN STALL  Fuck you!  PRICE  (Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)  No, FUCK YOU!!  (He collapses, panting against the stall door)  Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.  BATEMAN  That's the spirit.  They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope  of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking  their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into  their gums.  INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT   Bateman saunters toward the bar as \\\"Pump Up the Volume\\\"  plays in the background.  BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.  He hands her two drink tickets.  BARGIRL  It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's  a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.  Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her  a $50.  She turns her back and searches the cash register for  change.  BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to  death and then play around with your blood.  The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is  smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING   Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.  A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows  looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist  high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large  Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive  electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly  impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of  a design magazine.  BATEMAN (V.0.)  My name is Patrick Bateman. I am  twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden  Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh  floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.  Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to  see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his  toilet.  BATEMAN  (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a  balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the  morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice  pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand  now.  Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.  Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living  room wearing the ice pack.  CUT TO:  A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the  shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  After I remove the icepack, I use a deep  pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a  water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body  scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.  Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a  gel facial masque.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which  I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my  routine.  Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is  stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He  begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in  readiness on the marble counter.  BATEMAN (V.O.) I always use an after-shave lotion with little  or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes  you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye  balm, followed by a final moisturizing \\\"protective\\\" lotion...  Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,  giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been  wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque  off his face.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some  kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold  gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably  comparable: I simply am not there.  INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING   Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled  white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large  expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by  Bateman's interior decorator.  Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a  huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,  shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and  tone.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  It is hard for me to make sense on any given  level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality  is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is  persistent.  Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a  full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,  adjusting his cuff-links.  BATEMAN (V.0.)  My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared  a long time ago, if they ever did exist.  He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.  He gives his reflection a smile.  INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY   As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who  looks just like him.  MAN  Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.  Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling  his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,  wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.  JEAN  Late?  BATEMAN  Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?  JEAN  Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what  he was canceling or why.  BATEMAN  I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.  Anyone else?  JEAN  And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.  BATEMAN  When?  JEAN  After six.  BATEMAN  Negative. Cancel it.  Jean follows him into his office.  JEAN  Oh? And what should I say?  BATEMAN Just...say...no.  JEAN  Just say no?  Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.  BATEMAN  Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols  at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All  right?  JEAN  (Playfully)  Yes, sir.  She turns to leave.  BATEMAN  Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight  tonight.  Jean turns around.  JEAN  Oh, something. . romantic?  BATEMAN  No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.  JEAN  I'll do it.  BATEMAN  No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?  JEAN  You look nice today.  Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his  office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a  slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a  beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a  Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment  later with the Perrier and a file.  JEAN  Yes?  BATEMAN  Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that  outfit again.  JEAN  Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.  BATEMAN  I said \\\"Do not wear that outfit again.\\\" Wear a  dress. A skirt or something.  Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.  JEAN  (Smiling bravely)  You don't like this, I take it?  BATEMAN  Come on, you're prettier than that.  JEAN  (Sarcastically)  Thanks, Patrick.  The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.  BATEMAN  I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.  As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner  of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!  INT. TAXI - EVENING   EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's  fianc\\u00e9e, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping  a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically  beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with  herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a  small child.  EVELYN  I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd  want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something  ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots  of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.  CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring  out the window.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I'm trying to listen to the new George  Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc\\u00e9e-keeps buzzing  in my ear.  Evelyn continues to make notes.  EVELYN  Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.  Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.  And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.  BATEMAN  (Removing his Walkman)  Do...what.  EVELYN  Get married. Have a wedding.  BATEMAN  Evelyn?  EVELYN  Yes, darling?  BATEMAN  Is your Evian spiked?  EVELYN  We should do it.  BATEMAN  No-I can't take the time off work.  EVELYN  Your father practically owns the company. You can do  anything you like, silly.  BATEMAN  I don't want to talk about it.  EVELYN  Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just  quit? You don't have to work.  BATEMAN  Because I...want...to...fit...in.  The taxi bumps to a halt.  INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT   A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in  self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed  plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel  smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are  made of extremely uncomfortable  bolted steel.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace  since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,  and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.  Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are  already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,  with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with  ragged black hair and bad skin.  They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus  that look like minimalist art.  PRICE  The menu's in braille.  He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long  kiss.  PRICE  I have to talk to you.  He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.  EVELYN  (Over her shoulder)  Pat, this is my cousin Vanden  and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.  BATEMAN  (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and  checking his hair)  Hi. Pat Bateman.  Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.  BATEMAN  Let me guess-you live in the East Village?  Pause.  STASH  SoHo.  COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.  Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from  precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is  considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is  half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a  rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He  wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and  Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,  bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.  They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,  Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.  COURTNEY  (Whispering)  Stop it!  Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.  LATER:  Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is  quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching  Evelyn and Price.  BATEMAN (V.O.) I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn  are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s  usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight  I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,  though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,  the biggest dufus in the business.  Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.  COURTNEY Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is  becoming to...commercial?  CARRUTHERS  Yes, I read that.  PRICE  Oh, who gives a rat's ass?  VANDEN  Hey. That affects us.  PRICE  (Wired on coke)  Oh ho ho. That affects us? What  about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that  affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri  Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of  Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?  BATEMAN  Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important  problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign  policy is important, but there are more pressing problems  at hand.  PRICE  Like what?  BATEMAN  Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow  down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world  hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We  have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We  have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and  oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while  also promoting equal rights for women but change the  abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still  somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.  The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.  BATEMAN  We also have to control the influx of illegal  immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional  moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in  movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have  to promote general social concern and less materialism in  young people.  Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and  mystified.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick, how thought-provoking.  INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING   Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.  BATEMAN  Why don t you just go for Price?  EVELYN  Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?  BATEMAN  He's rich.  EVELYN  Everybody's rich.  BATEMAN  He's good-looking.  EVELYN  Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.  BATEMAN  He has a great body  EVELYN  Everybody has a great body now.  Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get  Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the  Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,  he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to  look around him at the TV, then takes notice.  EVELYN  What do you want to do with that, floss with it?  Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.  EVELYN  Are you using minoxidil?  BATEMAN  No. I'm not. Why should I ?  EVELYN  Your hairline looks like it's receding.\",\n",

He is becoming a little aggressive with his kink. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he thinks that me wearing fox ears during sex is adorable and hot. I thought it was cute too so I played along. I'm usually the dominant one in our relationship and it fit well into that narrative. But now it's becoming more present in our relationship than I'd like. He wants me to wear the ears all the time, and he literally talks to me in baby talk (the way you'd talk to a dog in public). We went to target and while I was looking for some birthday cards for my dad, he said \\\"Aww you're being such a good girl, I wish you had your little fox tail to wag\\\". Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him.

            "        \"text\": \"Some of you today experienced the fun of trading a FOMC day\\u2026 it can be quite\\u2026 interesting to say the least\\u2026. So lets dive right into it. \\n\\nOverall from the low of Monday to the close of todays market SPY has gone up nearly 4.4% in 3 days\\u2026 SPY has not seen more then one green day since February 24th and 25th. It has also not seen more than three consecutive green days since January 28th where it saw 4 green days in a row. Before that the last 3 or more green days in a row dates back to December 21st. That is nearly 3 months with only one instance of three consecutive green days in a row and only two consecutive green days in a row(February  24th/ 25th, February 15th/ 16th, and January 28th to Feb 2nd). That surely is a lot of red days over a three month period. \\n\\nStatistics would tell us tomorrow after two green consecutive green days SHOULD be a red day. Now will it happen or not is the question and IF it does happen how red will it be? \\n\\nToday lets look at the daily chart first. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3w8yiwiwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4aa8e7b8f262ee9d8eb590b6582ff3ae23fdca8\\n\\nWe have the elusive death cross only $2 apart now. Bulls managed to not only close a candle above the daily 8 ema but also the daily 20 ema which are both bullish movements. The real test will come at the daily 200 ema (if we get there) which sits near 438. We have not completely closed a candle above the daily 200 ema since February 16th. \\n\\nThe current channel we are sitting in shows that the top of the grey channel\\u2026 to lead to a bull run breakout\\u2026 is right between the daily 200 and daily 50 ema. The sweet spot will be right about 438 if it attempts to do it tomorrow. It is very possible this could continue its bullish movement tomorrow and break this 3 month long channel. IT would be the first step for the bulls to regain momentum and a big HINT to stop playing puts as much. \\n\\nOne key note on the daily chart which leads to me further to believe that we will see a red day tomorrow is that the daily candle closed as a massive hanging man candle. The hanging man candle is the opposite for a hammer candle and usually signals a reversal. In general as long as the algos and who ever pumped this 4.4% in 3 days allows it to we should not go much higher than this. In theory SPY should open at or below the close and never break above it. Over night we will need to keep an eye on futures and if SPY opens red there is a very high indication it will stay red. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wwb6halwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e432b28acfae20c929b8c7ab86a3b9bdf309e7\\n\\nThe weekly chart is one I have not reference yet in my TA but I stumbled upon it today when someone brought it up in the intraday chat room and I got to say it tells quite the story here. We are in a very much so downward trend and these weekly candles are absolutely massive compared to the usual weekly candles we see. \\n\\nIf this weekly candle closes here it will be the first candle in 3 weeks to close above the weekly 50 ema. The weekly 8 ema is still resistance and has not been closed above in 10 weeks. That\\u2019s a very long time to be clearly in a down cycle\\u2026 IF you look at the weekly 8 ema what number do you see? 437\\u2026 which is almost exactly what I referenced was the upper limit of the grey channel. 437 to 438 is a very CLEAR line in the sand that bulls HAVE to break in order to turn this bear market back into a bull market. The question is can they do it? \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vo2zqwwmwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee13360413e52c970a1807815354520b6de7310\\n\\nIntraday today on the 15 minute chart was quite interesting. The bulls came out with a vengeance this morning with some of the strongest buying power I have seen in weeks. It managed to make an intraday high around 434.5 before inevitably selling off and by all means turning a bullish day into a bearish day trend. Once the FOMC and rate hike dropped at 2pm we saw one of the fattest red 15minute candles I have seen in a very long time. We saw a recover and more red but then we saw some \\u201cmagic\\u201d aka fuckery that some how turned a red day and a clear red market sentiment into a bullish day. We watched SPY actually go red but some how managed to close up 2.22%. To say I am shocked is an understatement. \\n\\nMy humble opinion is that the market has been held up the last 3 days and that that massive 2pm sell off we saw is the TRUE market sentiment. Overall it will be interesting to see if the markets finally get to behave how they want tomorrow or not. \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvkkrieqwtn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab3dd99bcc2654f72aa155552c5140a4f1928a67\\n\\n This afterhours movement stopped at a very peculiar price level\\u2026 437.23\\u2026 Which if you remember from the daily and weekly\\u2026. That is the breakout territory. Afterhours saw a very clear rejection right at that trend line before continuing lower. You can even see my dotted resistance line for the channel there. That is the level to watch tomorrow. IF spy can break through that 437 level tomorrow we may just see a small bullrun return. However, like I said we just may get the big gap down and red day which statistically is probable. \\n\\nAnother thing to note that on every time frame from 15 minutes to 4 hours SPY is overbought\\u2026 the only non-overbought timeframes is the daily. While I don\\u2019t put it past MM to run this up and to break the trend line IF I had to be a bet though I would say we will finish red tomorrow somewhere between the daily 8 ema of 426 and the 20 ema of 430. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n10% challenge-\\n\\nI made 7 trades today. One was an overnight $100 lotto put I closed for a nice $1.5\\u2026 besides that I managed to make my 10% goal and daily $500+/ day goal and then some today. Of the 7 trades I made only 3 were green. But of the 4 red 3 of those were closed out under 5% red. I am still testing out this new indicator and realistically will be for the next month or two while I get a feel for it. \\n\\nPosition size wise today most of my positions are only about 20% of my NORMAL size for an option trade. Most of this is to the indicator and not really looking to bet a lot of money on it. But the 2 of the 3 green trades were my biggest position size today and one of the red was of the 3 biggest position sizes for the day. \\n\\nOverall I continue to mitigate losses and i am also attempting with the held of this new indicator about adjusting my sizing of entries based on confidence of success. So far it is working well and for the week I am having a very good week. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRemember- send me a DM if you would like to stay in touch with these daily TA/ premarket posts after april 2nd!\",\n",

If the company gets your attention, do your own research. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe all know that EV's being the future of transportation is almost a sure thing and we all have heard the cliche \\\" the people that made the most money during the gold rush, were the ones that were selling shovels\\\".  Investing in a company that makes charging stations, looks like a good bet for the investors that have higher risk tolerance. I would like to introduce you to a company, that I think has very good potential, but is still staying under the radar, probably due to the fact that it is based in Europe. That company is Wallbox (WBX) . \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWallbox is a company that is specialised in offering smart charging stations for home use. That might be \\\"smart\\\", cuz the public space is way more crowded and their potential competitors there are very well-funded and bigger. You will still get exposure to this subsector by buying WBX, but I will talk about this later. Wallbox products have a lot of features. They allow you to control your charger remotely so you can schedule charging sessions to benefit from off-peak energy rates, monitor your charger status, and more through the Wallbox app. Also, their as they call it \\\"proprietary bidirectional technology\\\" allows you to charge and discharge your EV, converting it into an energy storage unit that can replace or add capacity to a home battery. Their best selling product Quasar, is the the world\\u2019s lightest and smallest DC charger and supports facial recognition and gesture control. Last, but not least, their products are very aesthetically pleasing and that might be more important than you think. For a rather small company, they have a very dedicated fan base. One of the main things that distinguishes great companies from the others is that the future industry leaders are able to create a very big brand loyalty and even if they are at the early stage of its development, you can see that people love their work and it is only about time till they expand further. It is no wonder that Quasar was one of the best selling AMZN products last year.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWallbox are also selling products for business use and their idea is for the companies to be able to use their electric fleet as a power grid for their storage spaces or office buildings. Furthermore, they just announced their public space charging station - Supernova, that offers 50 percent cost reduction and very fast charging (15 min. for a charge). Its revolutionary design allows for a no cost power boost and also comes with advanced software and touchscreen. Wallbox are definitely entering this segment a bit late, but as an investor it is nice to have exposure all of the subsectors in the EV charging business. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow, let's take a look at their financials. Wallbox has a very manageable debt that is a bit more than its less than its quarterly revenue, lower P/S than all of its major competitors and  the biggest operating margins in the industry. Their revenue growth for the year is over 250%.  They also have the backing of the spanish energy giant  Iberdrola. The company is well-diversified and sells in more than 100 countries. \\n\\nPositions: 160 shares, might add more in the future. \\n\\nPS: Of course this is not a financial advice. I just think that the risk reward/ratio of this play is lower than the typical ratio for WSB favourites, but this does not say much.\",\n",

I was looking at the various filings and I came across something interesting in the statement of cash flows. \\n\\nFor the past 5 years the majority of their net cash from operating activities, and overall change in cash, relied heavily on recognition of depreciation and amortization. In 2021 ARC recognized $25M in depreciation and amortization and a total net cash flow from operations of $36M. This means that 69% (can\\u2019t make this shit up) of their cash from operations is from depreciation recognition. This also seems to be the only thing driving a relatively balanced change in cash flow. Without this recognition of depreciation of $25M they would be bleeding cash.\\n\\nThis seems like a huge red flag when you consider that they use standard straight line depreciation and are carrying an accumulated  depreciation balance of $229M. This leads me to believe that they have to be close to complete recognition of depreciation on a significant portion of their PP&amp;E and will not be able to continue supplementing their cash flow with this depreciation recognition. My fear is this could lead to overburn of cash and a reduction in retained earnings and dividends. \\n\\nWould love to know the thoughts of this esteemed community of apes.\",\n",

Well, commodity trading houses have seen margin calls and are short of liquidity, many have been unable to buy commodities to be delivered to refiners/end users. Expect shortages of finished products as end user inventory draws down over the next month or so.\\n\\nthe key passage here\\n\\n*\\\"In private, industry executives acknowledge they are skipping some deals to conserve cash. Lots of the price volatility of recent days can be traced by trading houses and others avoiding taking positions. The commodity market is trading risk, rather than supply and demand fundamentals. Liquidity is thin.\\\"*\\n\\noil metals and other commodities are run by commodity trading houses which arrange shipment, find storage, find tankers, and do delivery to end users. They trade in around 2-3 trillion worth of commodities globally per year. What has happened is many got margined called for the past 2-3 weeks due to the LME/Nickel debacle as well as the commodity spike. And as a result, have stopped operations to conserve cash, hence no bid for commodities for the past week or so.\\n\\nThis will mean an epic shortage on the end user side. AKA refineries running out of raw materials, or an order that would have to be double/triple what it normally would to catch up.\\n\\nEnd product/shortage is going to get a whole lot worse. You could see $10/gallon gas and $80 spot brent at the same time. \",\n",

Jpow expects inf to be 4.5% end of this year, how much of that reduction will that be directly caused by fed's hikes? - answer, err, jiberish, supply chain, base effects, blah blah, monetary policy runs a lag of 9-12 months, so the answer is nothing at all.\\n\\n2. In the longer term 1-2 years, Jpow expects to still run an interest rate at less than inflation, so still runs economy hot. Why has jpow made that deliberate choice? - er, ah, um, blah blah, supply chain, no real answer.\\n\\n3. What is the timeline of expected declines in inflation and causes? - answer, originally was supposedly end of Q1, ie now. (is he stoned or what?) Now Putin has aparently shifted it to second half of year with higher oil prices. (Wait, but oil is now lower than before the war.) Reasons for reductions in inflation: supply chain easing, base effects of year on year calculation. In other words, transitory. \\n\\n4. Has the fact you are not fully confirmed affected your ability to do anything? - no.\\n\\nSo there you have it, the latest Jpow innovation, it's transitory but not being actually called transitory!!!!\\n\\nSo you know what to do, buy the shit out of everything.

That\\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\\n\\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\\n\\n\\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \\u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\\u201d\\n\\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\\n\\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\\n\\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \\u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \\u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\\n\\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \\\"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\\\"\\n\\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\\n\\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \\n\\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\\n\\nRussia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \\u2013 Russia is among the world\\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\\n\\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\\n\\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \\u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\\n\\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \\u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\\u201d\\n\\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\\u2019 median projections. That\\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\\n\\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\\n\\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\\n\\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\\n\\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \\u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\\u201d to \\u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\\u201d\\n\\nOther Fed moves\\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \\\"at a coming meeting\\\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\\n\\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\\n\\nWednesday\\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\\n\\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\\n\\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \\u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\\n\\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\",\n",

The truth is drug discovery and development takes a long ass time - 3 to 5 years for a winning drug, 10+ or NEVER for a losing one that doesn't get FDA approval etc. Regulations are also changing as well - with psychedelics so far going the medical treatment route. \\n\\nA lot of us are looking at companies that will never make it - also looking at drug development ONLY, when there's companies generating **revenue right now by supplying drugs to researchers and psychedelic drug companies** for clinical trials and development.  This market should take off as more clinical trials are started, and the clinics that serve Ketamine right now will be able to serve Psilocybin, LSD etc. to their patients. Hospitals will also get in on the action - this is a multi-million dollar business once this gets going.  \\n\\nLooking at a report that breaks down some of the numbers behind this and shows how a psychedelic supply chain could work in the future:  For example, there are 300 therapy clinics adminstering ketamine right now.  If these clinics added only 10 psilocybin patients, with customers taking a couple dosages a week (1 gram of psilocybin can be sold for up to $10,000), we're looking a $100 million dollar industry.\\n\\n[https://capital10x.com/psychedelic-supply-chain-market/](https://capital10x.com/psychedelic-supply-chain-market/)\",\n",

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \\\"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\\\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\\n\\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\\n\\nBelow, we take a look at **ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM)**, which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. ZIM Integrated Shipping Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\\n\\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;\\n\\n**Set to Beat the Market?**\\n\\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ZIM that show why this container shipping company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\\n\\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\\n\\nFor ZIM, shares are up 2.54% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Shipping industry is up 2.95% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.66% compares favorably with the industry's 12.31% performance as well.\\n\\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of ZIM Integrated Shipping Services have increased 54.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 228.78% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -9.29% and 10.77%, respectively.\\n\\nInvestors should also pay attention to ZIM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ZIM is currently averaging 3,698,080 shares for the last 20 days.\\n\\n**Earnings Outlook**\\n\\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ZIM.\\n\\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ZIM's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.96 to $31.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\\n\\n**Bottom Line**\\n\\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ZIM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep ZIM Integrated Shipping Services on your short list.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"I'll keep this short. \\n\\nThe UK residential construction industry has taken a beating since the start of the year. Primarily for several reasons. The government is punishing house builders for cladding issues as a result of the Grenfell Tower Fire in 2017 and has levied the industry with a \\u00a34bn pound fine collectively. In addition, they've also introduced a residential property developer tax of 4% starting in April 2022. Looking at the macro picture the property development industry has had a pretty good run since GFC and we're now nearing those peak levels once again and the market is scared. They believe rate hikes are about to really affect consumer affordability. In addition, rising inflation is another fear they believe is going to cause a squeeze on margins. As a result of all of this, the market has just sold off the industry collectively. Despite most (if not all) builders posting record results. It's this fear of lower earnings in the near future causing mispricing - in my opinion. \\n\\nHowever, I believe Persimmon is the best of the bunch. Primarily because it's a cost leader. I consider them to be the equivalent of Ryanair. They run a tight ship. In comparison to their peers, they have a vertically integrated supply chain - manufacturing their own bricks, timber frames, tiles etc and are more insulated from supply disruptions and inflation worries than peers. In addition, their low cost of manufacturing allows them to price homes below the national average while maintaining margins. If affordability does become an issue I believe more funds will spill over in the Persimmon bucket as a low-cost leader. In addition, they have more wriggle room to pass on price increases because of their cost advantage and economies of scale. \\n\\nThe UK housing market has more demand than supply can meet and this is the perfect tailwind for Persimmon to grow earnings over the near term as completions start to rise following the disruption from Covid. In addition, this same demand-supply dynamic should also keep prices high in the near term before it levels out leading to higher earnings. But that's just my two cents. \\n\\nThe company currently has an 11% dividend yield which further reinforces my view that the market is very concerned that earnings are about to take a beating. It hasn't been this high since the great financial crisis, which just says it all. \\n\\nBased on FCF projections (if the dividend yield isn't enough for you) the company should be worth in the range of \\u00a39bn - \\u00a313bn and currently has an EV of \\u00a36bn. The balance sheet is very clean with no debt and about \\u00a31.2bn in cash. \\n\\nThis company is a thing of dreams from my perspective. \\n\\nI should disclose that I do have an interest in this company and that I'm not offering financial advice. This post is simply for educational &amp; discussion purposes. \\n\\nWould love to hear what you all think.\",\n",

That's why EU sanctions have hit a ceiling. They need to be pushed.\\n\\nRussia: Will not stop until they either take Ukraine or Putin is toppled. Dictators rarely fall from the outside, hence the sanctions. There's at least one bank left out of sanctions, so Putin and the oligarchs are ok. Hence the West's huge aid to Ukraine, to allow it to keep fighting while the sanctions take effect.\\n\\nUkraine's image management is too sophisticated, so it's obvious they are getting a ton of help from foreign intelligence services.\\n\\nThey suddenly took quite a turn with their 'negotiations' with Russia. For some bizarre reason the Ukrainians keep spinning the negotiations as positive, constructive, working towards a ceasefire etc. Zelensky himself keeps hinting of giving in to Russia's official demands. It all feels as if they are about to sign a peace treaty, yet they keep asking for guns and to close the skies. Something's fishy.\\n\\n**My theory is this:** \\n\\nUSA is dead-set on using Ukraine to get rid of Russia. However, EU is now stalling and USA is realizing that Ukraine will lose without further hardcore support. \\n\\nI suspect the British (their intelligence services are just the best) are advising Ukraine to pretend that it's leaning close to accepting Russia's demands, hence all the positive spin on negotiations. This is lighting a fire on USAs backside to do more, faster. It needs to push EU to join the complete ban of energy/trade. This is why Biden is coming to EU next week. This is why the bordering countries to Ukraine went to visit today and started muttering things about a 'peace force' moving into Ukraine from EU to oversee things. \\n\\nCoincidentally, Republicans+Democrats are pushing a motion through senate to ban all Russian banks, which would forbid every country in the world from giving Russia a single dollar. This is targeting China and Germany/Italy. They want to use this as a stick when Biden goes to EU next week to push EU to do more. \\n\\nUSA has already stopped energy imports from Russia and banned all trade. USA has nothing to lose by banning the remaining Russian banks and using its force to push its allies to do more, willingly or not. If China breaks the sanctions it will give USA the perfect excuse to apply penalties to them as well. \\n\\nI foresee a complete ban of energy trade with Russia. Military intervention from NATO or a 'peace keeping force' that will act as bait to give pretext to NATO going in is also a good bet. They will not get rid of Putin without military intervention or insane financial pressure. \\n\\nI do not see this ending with Ukraine signing half the country away in a peace treaty. This is too good of a chance for USA to let it go. Things will only escalate further.\\n\\nPositions: SPY puts, MOS, USO, WEAT (I know it's not 'the' wheat we want but futures cost $50k and it behaves similarly)\",\n",

That said, I might have a thought no one has considered.\\n\\nChina's Winnie the Pooh asked the Fed not to raise interest rates two months ago:\\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/xi-jinping-warns-fed-against-hiking-interest-rates-11642502735\\n\\nThat's because he started on a path to consolidate power in Beijing, but ran into an unexpected problem. Earlier than expected tightening by the Fed while China is already cracking down would challenge Yuan parity. This was already happening in 2019 when the Fed was raising rates:\\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/yuan-falling-china-currency-manipulator-struggling-secretly-858981\\n\\nPlus given that the new league of self sabotaging nations (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc) is trying to challenge dollar hegemony, I wonder if JPow shocks us tomorrow to (among other priorities) challenge Yuan parity. \\n\\nIt is unlikely, but if by chance they assess that such a shock will increase domestic labor force participation (which lowers inflation), they have another reason (dollar hegemony) to do it. In fact, the Fed has repeatedly shocked markets since November to improve labor force participation. Here's my take on that and a pretty graph to show that it is working: \\nhttps://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1491974994313859089?t=_U5Px6yKJKL21o0aIE3UlQ&amp;s=19\\n\\nWould they risk recession? No, I think supply driven inflation and bottlenecks are so sudden and drastic that they're limiting growth. That's why I think we have stagflation. So if the Fed sees labor force participation as their solution to this supply side inflation, it makes sense to shock markets some more. Plus they get the bonus of making Winnie the Pooh tear up.\\n\\nNo I'm not holding puts.\",\n",

[Greasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)\\n\\nLet us dive in:\\n\\n1st: Let me take this layup real quick, movie theatre executives don't know dick on how to fucking mine for natural precious metals. Coincidentally, this is about as close as a YOLO a corporate executive/board can go.\\n\\n2nd: HYMC coincidentally drops an ATM stock offering this morning of up to 500 million unloading on apes as the stocks price launches. For those who don't understand, they are essentially able to soak up this 500% share price increase in taking a shitload of cash while massively diluting their shares. Isn't it odd that this was left out of the AMC press release and not spoken about at all on MSM today? Personally, I read an article in Barrons and NYT that completely failed to even mention it once. Side note: in a total dipshit move that makes Cramer look normal aaron [canceled](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1503763167473713155?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) his appearance on CNBC with a dumbass reply, what a fucking dweeb. Everyone knows in the era of Elon Musk, laws and court orders don't matter on Twitter and TV.\\n\\n3rd: Goldminers largest shareholder is Mudrick Capital \\\\~40% of stock outstanding. For you true autists, this is the same Mudrick Capital who bought 8.1 million shares of AMC stock in a closed offering and then sold the very same day. Wow, ain't that fucking weird. \\n\\n4th: The movements of this stock before this announcement are fucking sketch as hell. Take a look at 2.50 strike [call](https://imgur.com/a/62YCIqU) open interest. So you telling me that some entity just decided to yolo massive amounts of money on massive OTM calls days till expiry on some shit profitless mining company right before a fucking movie theatre buys a massive stake? Call me sherlock holmes cause that's suspicious. \\n\\n\\\\-Granted, most of the volume for these options came in Friday at prices between .15 and .60 and the options barely got above .30. Nonetheless, sketch as hell. But the general movements of the stock before the announcement is undeniable.\\n\\n4.5: This one isn't of any substance but I think it's worth something. This fucker took a picture with a sign in the middle of the desert as a showing of quality, no gold production or busty facilities. This is essentially if Elon Musk came out to woo his retarded investors with a new car model and instead of showing an actual car he shows a drawing.\\n\\nLike fuck me, put me in charge of Wendys and I'll invest in Diane Fosseys Gorilla fund so apes can break free from behind the dumpster and frolic free in the wild while simultaneously solving climate change by making biofuel from their shit.

I like many people bought AMC because we saw it was Shorted like GME but our money could buy many more shares of AMC than we'd get shares of GME.\\n\\n\\nFor this reason I think HYMC is a great play by AMC, After all HYMC is an extremely cheap stock right now with a low float, meaning it would be very easy for retail investors to buy up all the shares of HYMC. Drawing new investors into this mining company that has a high short interest, low float, and low cost is an Amazing short squeeze play!!! \\n\\n\\n However short squeeze aside, drawing in new investors to HYMC and allowing HYMC to generate more liquidity with a share offering will benefit both AMC &amp; HYMC in the long run, Yes while I know a Share offering will make it harder for a short squeeze to happen on HYMC it will generate the liquidity (money) that HYMC needs to get its feet off the ground and become a very profitable mining company. Keep in mind AMC has pushed a lot of it's debt off for a few years, and even if it takes 4 years for this mining company to be worth a lot more that's still an amazing play for AMC in the long run... \\n\\n\\nBasically it's a great play because the possibility of a short squeeze will draw retail investors in, and if it does squeeze it will cause AMC's stock to squeeze as well... But at the very least if HYMC does do a share offering and enough Apes buy into it, this will result in HYMC being a stronger company with a much more profitable future, which as a longer term investor it will vastly benefit AMC, especially when AMC's debt comes due and HYMC has multiplied in value.... \\n\\n\\nI'm currently jobless so I won't be buying any HYMC, but if I did have excess cash I would be buying HYMC as both a short squeeze play and/or a long term investment. All I can do at the moment is hold my AMC shares and sell covered calls to pay my bills lol \\ud83d\\ude06  Hopefully I'll get a job again soon so I can get back to buying more AMC...\\n\\n\\nTo those of you who buy Shares of HYMC I wish you all the best of luck!!! To those of you who think HYMC is just a distraction, all I have to say to you is... At the very least this is more positive news for AMC, just getting AMC in the news is good publicity, it's good that Apes have another reason to be excited about AMC!!!\\n\\n\\n*Not Financial Advice, I'm not a financial advisor\",\n",

So I'm guessing this is leading up to her starting to talk to me again. But I don't know if I wanna be friends with her again. She wasn't a very good friend to me before it happened. But idk there was a time where we were pretty close and I always wanted to be best friends with her. But idk if I can go back to how it was before 3 weeks and I got used to the idea of not being friends even if it made me a little sad. I don't really have anyone to like \\\"replace\\\" her if that makes sense no other girl best friend I'd hang out with outside of school and text a bunch. Even if we do start talking again though she won't be my girl bestfriend because there is someone else who I always hang out with at school. Me and the other girl just don't text that much and yea.\\n\\nI'm a boy btw idk if that matters at all here and yes.\",\n",

I can't wait to kick them out.\\n\\nMy son and daughter turn 18 in 3 weeks, I can't wait to ask them to leave. \\n\\nMy son ruined all my plans for him. He made my family a laughing stock. All because he can't be normal. \\n\\nThis started when my wife passed away when my children were 7. My son and daughter were both devastated. They started depending on each other for support. They started always sticking together.\\n\\nI think he was influenced by his sister. He started having feminine interests. I couldn't keep it a secret. It was absolutely humiliating. Other families soon got to know about his peculiar condition. \\n\\nHowever, there were some more serious consequences, I couldn't go through with a planned acquisition of a few assets. No other businesses families wanted to see their assets inherited by a 'peculiar person'. \\n\\nI tried to fix him. I spent millions of rupees. I did try. I took him around world, from bloody England to hunt foxes, to Mexico to hunt deer and to Namibia to hunt Wildebeest and Oryx. He always grew pale and never learned to chamber or cock a rifle. I tried enrolling him in cadet corps. I got a call back a few weeks later. He has got injured.\\n\\nWhy am I cursed like this? My family will end with me. I followed my fathers footsteps, I joined the army straight out of high school, when the Sri Lankan Civil War was raging. I got my first blood, in the Vanni, when I was 19. After serving I got my degree in Civil Engineering and joined my families construction firm, just like my father. \\n\\nAnyways, neither he nor my daughter want anything to do with me. They don't want my property. Even if they did, I wouldn't allow my beloved 'walawwa ', to go to freaks. \\n\\nI utterly HATE both of my children, my son because says that he is a girl and my daughter, because she encourages it. \\n\\nI hate them both. The only thing I can do is kick them out when they turn 18.\\n\\nI only have one regret. I should have separated them a long long time ago. If I did so, I still may have a son I could be proud of. \\n\\nI don't know why I am telling random strangers on the internet about my disgraceful children. Anyways, my rant ends here.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"\\\"Standpoint epistemology,\\\" so to speak, is an inherently arrogant and egocentric philosophy whose bases and implications alike are especially ugly. I cannot stand people who argue that it is somehow acceptable to engage in sloppy egoist reasoning when engaging in the public discourse. So many of the so-called \\u201ccritical theorists\\\" essentially evade epistemic concerns by positing that it is entirely permissible to operate on the quality of heuristics and reasoning that we use everyday, such as at the grocery store, to author academic papers about the philosophy of race or gender.\\n\\nSeriously: can people really not appreciate that reasoning about public policy and philosophy is inherently distinct from the \\\"reasoning\\\" we engage on a day-to-day basis? I fully accept that there are identity-based heuristics that are useful for demographic minorities in their everyday lives because they cannot \\u2014 nor can anyone \\u2014 be expected to engage in formal reasoning about in all facets their daily lives.\\n\\nBut if you are a bloody tenured university professor, subsidized with government expenditures, writing on the subject of philosophy, then your employment should be terminated immediately for authoring a paper with the aforementioned heuristics. Far too many individuals are terrified to admit to utter some variation of the sentence, \\u201cI don't know what the right answer is\\\" \\u2014 or accept that the ethically sound answer does not satisfy their personal preference. So they proceed to engage in a rarefied version of what the youth today call \\u201ccoping + seething\\u201d to justify the absurd and indefensible position that we should both accept an inordinately broad diversity of perspectives \\u2014 nay, *all* perspectives \\u2014 as valuable while simultaneously arguing that they can reason from personal anecdote for the entirety of the human conditions.\\n\\nI cannot stress this enough: if you are going to engage in reasoning on matters of public interest, then you must actually deign to make coherent arguments in favor of your perspectives. I do not care if you develop discriminatory heuristics to conduct your daily life insofar as they are adaptive and eschew cruelty (an aside: the late Judith Shklar's indispensable essay on the subject is a must-read for those who consider themselves benevolent human beings), but that does not and cannot justify those same heuristics being applied to public policymaking.\\n\\nOne can even be a theorist of why it is permissible to develop adaptive heuristics that involve objectively unfair discrimination against a group considered dominant as a means of maximizing well-being from a qualified utilitarian standpoint. But one cannot though apply those same principles to public reasoning and logic, because they are inherently grounded in behaviors instrumentally adaptive to the individual \\u2014 not what is just for society.\\n\\nIt is incredibly ironic to the author of this treatise that the very same individuals who constantly advocate for \\\"social justice\\\" in practice make arguments in the public discourse that bare not even the slightest relation to justice. They are making what in essence are pragmatic arguments about what is instrumentally adaptive for individuals with various identities to behave like, and then arguing that society should either punish or reward such people (with the outcome of this binary, of course, being based upon reductionist demographic identities). They are not, in fact, justifying the actions as they relate to justice: they are rationalizing why other people shouldn't criticize what they view as individually adaptive behaviours and then saying that a behaviour which is individually adaptive to members of one identity is inherently justified for all members of that identity.\\n\\nCome to think of it, the above is really a particularly egregious form of social rent-seeking, wherein practitioners adopt the phraseology of intersectionality to advocate especially narrow bands of interest and then rationalize why what they are doing is in fact about the essential nature of their identity in collective.\\n\\nThe arguments of these individuals are simply riddled with mottes and bailies, dodging between deontological and utilitarian justification for anecdotal behaviours with such rapidity that no one is capable of pinning them down for a sufficient duration to disaggregate and defeat their arguments. And should you attempt to do so, be prepared: they will mobilize their outsized social power to attempt to delegitimize your critique of their ultimately risible premises.\\n\\nIt is a classic tactic of historicists desiring to defend ideologies that are incoherent or absurd when soberly analyzed by those engaging in intellectually honest \\u2014 as opposed to motivated \\u2014 reasoning once they realize that they are unable to defend them by way of reasoned argument: these glorified sophists resort to constructing abstract and unfalsifiable social structures and to defend their ideas (the Maoist-style lynch mobs and struggle sessions they will lead against you for daring to publicly contradict them, however, are very *much* tangible and appreciable to the average man on the street).\\n\\nA particularly instructive example is the labor theory of value. Socialists and communists both in the East and West hemispheres of the world spent decades attempting to argue in defense of its absent validity *long* after its myriad absurdities had been laid bare via a series of, again, mottes and bailies whose essential purpose was to insinuate or outright claim that its critics despised the poor and downtrodden, or, even more sickeningly, believed that human life was inherently worthless.\\n\\nOh, sure: this world is not fair. Far too many suffer needless injustice. Yet no amount of discrimination and inequality justifies a tenured professor in a $650 suit from a San Francisco Louis Vuitton (okay, the Louis Vuittons that still retain any items in their inventories after the massive crime wave brought about the civilizationally destructive policies of the Marxist son of Jewish domestic terrorists currently occupying its top prosecutorial office) adopting these categories of behaviours. You may not take public money to reason about the public good and then proceed to assert that you do not have to reason from an objective standard.\\n\\nIn particular, it is irritating to watch a Black American professor from Georgetown University make such arguments \\u2014 to witness them assert that they do may simply refuse to engage in good-faith discussion with their academic critics by instrumentalizing the experiences of the genuinely underprivileged black women (some of whom I worked with in my PhD program when I took on a supervisorial job with Amazon to supplement my income as a poor international student attending Princeton). Sorry: only the latter group retain the right and privilege to use heuristics in their daily lives to deal with the discrimination that black public intellectuals speaking on what is just for society writ large plainly do not. The same issue and principle applies to much if not the outright majority of literature on transgender issues, where academics regularly pull sleights of hand as a means of pretending that they can treat their good-faith critics the same way a transgender individual being asked an identical question while they were trying to work as a cashier may.\\n\\nThis extremely malignant, contemptibly self-interested form of public reasoning, the moral taint of which is only lessened by the fact that, the author believes, too many individuals sincerely do not believe that this is the reality because they have essentialized their identity in such ways that enable them to deploy these types of duplicitous reasoning games.\\n\\nOften, the arguments are little more than the obverse of those made by \\\"scholarly\\\" white supremacists in the 1930s who resorted to play the same kinds of linguistic games when others thoroughly dismantled their earlier attempts at legitimate public reasoning. It is the reason why they retreated from actually trying attempting to prove a scientific or logical basis for racist discrimination into patently insulting arguments in the vein of \\\"\\\\[r\\\\]efusing to tolerate racism from white American southerners is in fact an attack on Southern heritage.\\\" One need only to observe the manner in way Richard Russell's arguments evolved over time as a means to frustrate salient critiques of his dastardly career to understand the way critical theorists, past and contemporary, have operated over the years. The more they are challenged on their analytical and epistemic failings, the more they retreat over a protracted duration of time into the essential \\\"essence\\\" and emotional needs of their respective identity groups.\\n\\nYes \\u2014 the dynamic of power was and remains different at the national level, but it is a highly effective tactic if you were or are locally dominant in a given institution or region. If you hold social power within such an institution, then you can employ it to suppress legitimate criticism from within. As such, you no longer require sound arguments to deal with external actors; you just need to make arguments that obfuscate the injustice of what you are arguing for.\\n\\nTo be clear: I am not saying the aforementioned groups are identical or morally equivalent (for one, Russell knew full well what he was doing, and laid it out explicitly in internal memorandums we only now have access to). Yet both exploit asymmetries of power and concern in a way that allows them to engage in poor, even destructive public policy reasoning in their prescriptions for the society in which we live. It is critically important to recognize this brand of malignant public reasoning when it rears its ugly head precisely because it is permissive of the obfuscation of justice to be doled out most effectively. And it is worsened in both cases by the elite biases of the journalistic class \\u2014 who mediate the interactions between these such groups \\u2014 and the mass public.\\n\\nLet us return to Russell's case: the Governor was capable of escaping with incoherent argumentation because even the liberal white voters of the 1950s were scarcely concerned with interrogating them; they may have thought that although he was wrong on some level, but they extended him excessive assumptions of good faith in the rarefied Washington political circles of the day.\\n\\nA near-identical dynamic happens with journalism in the present day as well as the modern social justice movement, where indefensible arguments are merely tolerated, uncritically, from progressively-coded voices because journalists do not wish to suffer the social sanctions resulting from a timid \\u2014 let alone spirited \\u2014 attempt to challenge them. This, then, necessitates that the modern social justice movement is only ever contested by those sufficiently far from the progressive mainstream such they may be delegitimized epistemically within the institutions and regions where this style of poisonous reasoning rules with an iron fist.\\n\\nI cannot stand this fundamental dynamic among professors, because it is quite frankly the very *purpose* of conducting academic research. Yes, normal people are going to harbor objectively silly, egocentric heuristics that may feel appear adaptive to them but damage the societal fabric in the collective; that does not mean that an anthropological professor from Columbia University has that substantive basis engage in the same behavior. It is just so bloody lazy. Have the decency to shut up and retire if you cannot make any legitimate contribution to your perennially deteriorating field! It is an imperative for us as a society to construct structures that strongly discourage conflict entrepreneurialism solely for the purpose of maintaining the job of the researcher freeloading on the public dime.\\n\\nAnd that brings me to my antepenultimate point: the inherent difficulty with occupations reliant on demand from the social relevance of a topic is that its careerists must in perpetuity argue for the social relevance of their topic, no matter the tortured logic or nonexistent evidence \\u2014 after all, they have to pay the rent on their studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. This is a classic example of rent-seeking: it is the weaponization of asymmetric information and social status to accumulate rents without producing usefully oneself. Social media has only magnified the incentives for this kind of behaviour exponentially. More than ever, structural means designed from the middle up to minimize such perverse incentive are critically necessary.\\n\\nThe author has heard it described by the legendary Western philosopher William Luther Pearce as the \\\"George and the Dragon Incentive\\\" in relation to social activism: in summation, if it is the case that if one's occupation is created around the existence of a widespread social ill, actually *solving* said social ill becomes extremely costly for you on an individualized basis even if the benefits accruing to society in the collective are great. So, subject to classic concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, activists are heavily incentivized to partake in anti-social conflict entrepreneurialism and then rationalize why such destructive behaviour is necessary. Even more significantly, this very problem applies to a vast swathe of academic fields whose essential demand function relies on their ability to maintain a perennial \\\"discourse\\\" \\u2014 epistemological quality be damned \\u2014 and the constant presence of societal ailments.\\n\\nIn closing: it is perhaps true that past norms of respectability and its adjacents stood as crude means of suppressing this destabilizing incentive in some fashion. But we as a society, as a common people, desperately need to figure out a viable solution in this era of pervasive social media and postmodern psychosis.\",\n",

I find his kind demeanor admirable, and most importantly, his caring attitude towards his friends. The moment where he hugged the protagonist, \\\"Kris\\\", I could feel his warmth radiating through the cold and unfeeling monitor.\\n\\nThis has however, had the rather unfortunate effect of creating a void within my very being. I now yearn to search for a companion just like the character \\\"Ralsei\\\". I must acquire a companion who is male, slightly older than me, huggable, fluffy, knows how to bake, hugs me when sad, frequently outfits himself with green, type of friend. He must be knowledgeable about politics and world events as reflective of his character in \\\"Delta-Rune\\\", preferably holding traditional right wing conservative views, and be an avid connoisseur in the hobby of firearms, so as to be compatible with my own personality.\\n\\nThis companion must also be soft and kind, to the point where he is sometimes teased by my other, more masculine and strong friends (in a friendly nature of course!), but not so much where he is bullied by others who seek to exploit his innocence. He must also not be the ever so dreadful \\\"beta-male\\\" stereotype, as it would mean he would consume products made of soy and use the Nintendo Switch gaming console. Did I mention he must be soft and huggable?\\n\\nI believe I am not requesting much. Such a companion should be a kindred spirit. If you fine folks have any advice on perhaps, finding, acquiring, or perhaps even creating such a friend, please do let me know. I would greatly appreciate it.\\n\\nMy warmest farewells to thee.\",\n",

So if you are really in this situation you should study CBDC since this would make this 100% impossible.\\n\\nLets say you have $1.2M physical money. you're in the USA, and you want to get around the tax system. And lets say you're 18, so you have a number of years. The easiest way is through using tax loopholes. Even more capital gains tax loopholes.\\n\\nLong term capital gains you don't have to pay taxes on the first $40k (check with your tax person since this changes every year).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf I was to do this I would backdate something I own to make it look like I owned it for over 12 months. I would move to a state with 0 capital gains tax like FL. I would then sell it to myself anonymously for $40k. I would officially buy it back for $1. Repeat this yearly for 30 years.\\n\\nTo figure out that thing I would use, I would have to talk to an accountant. I know if you use something like a chair you might have to deal with sales tax. Art has their own tax code I am not familiar with so maybe that. Like many criminals use something called freeports with art to get around the tax system.\\n\\nA big thing to note with freeports is [https://secretsofartmagazine.com/2020/02/freeport-for-artworks-a-tool-to-avoid-tax-duties-might-come-to-an-end/](https://secretsofartmagazine.com/2020/02/freeport-for-artworks-a-tool-to-avoid-tax-duties-might-come-to-an-end/)\\n\\n# What makes a freeport truly exceptional and attractive to the art collectors is the fact that the contents of freeports are invisible to tax authorities and foreign governments. Complete anonymity is guaranteed and art collections in freeports cannot be traced to the original owners and no government can tax these assets.\\n\\nNote this is tax avoidance and not tax evasion. Tax evasion is 100% illegal. Tax avoidance is using loopholes to legally qualify to pay lower taxes.\\n\\nOne avoidance tactic that the richest people use is loans. Much of the value of the richest people is not in currency. It is within stocks, properties, and so on. So what happens is if they sale then they have to pay taxes depending on the amount being sold. But if you take an overcollateralized loan against the assets, and use the loan as you would with normal income. It isn't taxed because it is a loan. Now because the amount being taken out and the people involved, the interest rate is near 0%, and buying a number of properties to rent them out is more than enough to pay off the base payment on the loan (hint why the anti-remote work has kicked up. Commercial prosperity values tanked and there is extremely less renters, which means rich people are risking a lot more if they pay off the minimum. So you are having to go to your physical office to keep some random rich person happy not from the work you are doing. But from the rental payments your company is giving to the management company which pays the rich person.) Anyways, when they want to buy a jet, they make a company around that and lease the jet out to themselves for $1. The cost of everything becomes a business expense which helps lower taxes by a good bit.\\n\\nI can go on, but I'm sure everyone gets my point in the ultra rich use tax avoidance all the time to get around the system (a fix to this btw is flat tax and get rid of freeports, but the political people who can fix this also use this same system against itself).\",\n",

I find his kind demeanor admirable, and most importantly, his caring attitude towards his friends. The moment where he hugged the protagonist, \\\"Kris\\\", I could feel his warmth radiating thorugh the cold and unfeeling monitor.\\n\\nThis has however, had the rather unfortunate effect of creating a void within my very being. I now yearn to search for a companion just like the character \\\"Ralsei\\\". I must acquire a companion who is male, slightly older than me, huggable, fluffy, knows how to bake, hugs me when sad, frequently outfits himself with green, type of friend. He must be knowledgeble about politics and world events as reflective of his character in \\\"Delta-Rune\\\" , preferrably holding traditional right wing conservative views, and be an avid connoisseur in the hobby of firearms, so as to be compatible with mine own personality.\\n\\nThis companion must also be soft and kind, to the point where he is sometimes teased by my other, more masculine and strong friends (in a friendly nautre of course!), but not so much where he is bullied by others who seek to exploit his innocence. He must also not be the ever so dreadful \\\"beta-male\\\" stereotype, as it would mean he would consume products made of soy and use the Nintendo Switch gaming console. Did I mention he must be soft and huggable?\\n\\nI believe I am not requesting much. Such a companion should be a kindred spirit. If you fine folks have any advice on perhaps, finding, acquiring, or perhaps even creating such a friend, please do let me know. I would greatly appreciated it.\\n\\nMy warmest farewells to thee.\",\n",

He is intelligent, kind, and overall wonderful. But we keep running into a problem. He is becoming a little aggressive with his kink. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he thinks that me wearing fox ears during sex is adorable and hot. I thought it was cute too so I played along. I'm usually the dominant one in our relationship and it fit well into that narrative. But now it's becoming more present in our relationship than I'd like. He wants me to wear the ears all the time, and he literally talks to me in baby talk (the way you'd talk to a dog in public). We went to target and while I was looking for some birthday cards for my dad, he said \\\"Aww you're being such a good girl, I wish you had your little fox tail to wag\\\". Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him. He got really sad and told me that of course he loves me for me. He's been really quiet since. Have I fucked up? Am I being too insensitive about his fetish?\",\n",

She cant reathe but she digests the tip of my sausage and lives upon the nutrients. She cries and cries and tries to reach for her gun - but it isnt in her holster. Ive got it behind my . I pull it out - she freaks out. You can see what little hope she has left degrade further and further - she wont survive this. But she has one thing, one hope, one personto cling on to - and he just knocked on the door. \\\"judy? \\\" i hear nick's voice and picture  his smug face before i see it. I turn around. Nick. He stands there horrified, groceries in hand, as he witnesses the horrors happening before him. Judy is choking on my pork chop and running out of air - and time. Her tearful eyes look to nick in desperation, then realization, as she sees the revolver in my  hand. I lift it, quivering, at the wilde's freaking face. He freezes, my finger squeezes, a shot rings off. Hole in his head, brains on the wall behind him. I have slain the mighty nicholas wilde, and extinguished the dying flame of hope that judy clung to. She stops fighting for her life after watching nick sink to the floor. Within seconds, she is dead, mouth still on my sausage, reaching all the way down to her stomach. Finally, it bursts. Gallons of piping hot cream are flung into the stomach of the dead hopps. At last, i am satisfied.\",\n",

Or like even before that since we both just didn't mind it and had fun together being a regular couple and all but like she asked me when her last period was and I thought it was at 26 so I told her that, she got reassured but I backread our messages and well turns out it was at december 24 she got mad at me and told me how I didn't have to tell her that unnesesarry information and she was late for 2 days and of course I don't blame her at all since her life is gonna change drastically if she was to be pregnant, I also was shocked on it aswell and is very worried since I really really value her alot and I care so much about her. After that she didn't wanna talk with me at all, I kept spamming her, reassuring her even told her that I'll be glad to help if things do get bad but well she would just leave me on read, except for the fact that she would say that I should focus on myself first and not worry about her yknow. As of now she's 6 days late on her period and Im very much am worried about how things would turn out and well today was the day she told me she lost feelings for me already, I kept trying to make her stay but she really isn't interested in me anymore,she told me I shouldnt be desperately waiting for nothing and that I shouldnt wasting my time someone that has lost feelings for me . Oh and for more context one of the reasons were probably because during november and december we've gotten in some fights but eventually we resolved it together as a partner, still she told it was best for the both of us and it really does hurt for me she was the best person to be there for me, I appreciated the things she did for me and I love her still so much, I just cant get over her, I literally have her as my wallpaper, her phone case, her sim card, her bra bracelet every single thing and she was the one that changed my appearance the most, I planned alot of things to do with her in the future and I still wanna stay by her side, I  I value her so fucking much dawg I can't stop balling my eyes out this is by far the worst thing that has happend to me. I wanna hug her one last time like it's just painful man everything reminds me of her confused\\n\\n\\u2022\\u0301  \\u203f ,\\u2022\\u0300\",\n",

But of course I had waffles and maple syrup for breakfast, and then I went outside and chatted all day long, and when night reared its peaceful face, the show was on. At a slow pace, the night went by. I almost fell asleep but not quite, and while the cold did give quite an awful bite, even a little frost nip could be warmed by friendship. Friends to talk to, friends to get. People to laugh with, and dogs to pet! I loved that day, and I loved that night, but I had eaten beans for dinner, so I had to shite. I vaguely remember their faces, and the laughs we shared, going on and on without a care. Life was good, and life was nice. The lights turned off when the sun came up, and it awoke the pup on my lap. It had been a whole night, and a fun one at that. I put on my jacket and I put on my hat, I left with my parents and it ended with that. I had fun, I'd met new people, I'd laughed and loved, making a nice cup of mud. I'd miss them, those amazing random people. I'd bonded with that silly little puppy, he was cute, oh wasn't he? But those friendships had to end, the joy is not constant, I had no more time to spend. As I left in the car, I looked back at the people, not one of them evil, and I thought \\\"all that happiness surely can't be legal!\\\" It was nice, I will miss them. That day and that night? That was a gem. They sprouted out happiness like leaves from an elm. It was wonderful, a dream-like realm. As I was and still am only fourteen, this amount of interaction was completely unforeseen, but I enjoyed it, I have to admit. Thank you for listening, and please have a good day! And remember; somebody cares about you, even if they're a stranger. Those can lead to relationships stronger and more beautiful than a diamond!\",\n",

The Pok\\u00e9mon were more memorable than other gens because many were made for specific purposes Chansey/ Kangaskhan for the safari zone, Snorlax for path blocking, etc. but the graphics are awful. It\\u2019s a gameboy game so I can\\u2019t complain. Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it.\\n\\nGold/Silver/Crystal: They added the Rocket grunt theme : )! Two regions! Legendary beasts and day/ night! Don\\u2019t forget about friendship! Loads of new content, that\\u2019s great. As for the story\\u2026 homeless Team Rocket? Slowpoke Tails? Err.. scary Miltank? Jerkier rival than Blue/Green/Gary/Pooface? I don\\u2019t have much to say. This game is alright, but its Kanto is pretty empty. It is a Gameboy game though. Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it.\\n\\nRuby/Sapphire/Emerald: Music absolutely slaps! Gives me nostalgia even though I only played ORAS and a bit of Emerald recently! Ah, yes the GBA. Truly loves up to the A. Much improved graphics and sound quality. THIS is what I think of when I think \\u201cold Pok\\u00e9mon.\\u201d Only real complaints are that in this game Archie/Maxie\\u2019s goals are harder to understand than in ORAS (shout out to ORAS for that!) and Archie/Maxie are essentially the same person. One likes water, one likes land. (Once again, shout out to ORAS for that!)\\n\\nDiamond/Pearl: I strongly dislike these. SLOW. The game has pauses. EVERY SINGLE TURN. In a TURN BASED GAME. For people who don\\u2019t want to take a whole move slot for defog to travel through one route. That route was most of my gameplay. Half of my moves missed (fog) waiting forever for my turn\\u2026 absolute pain! Also, story was never a strong thing for Pok\\u00e9mon games\\u2026 but come on! Man sad. He no longer wants sad. Wants to destroy world? Defeat him? He and his stupid Team JUST DISAPPEAR WITH A FLASH. THAT\\u2019S IT.\\n\\n\\nPlatinum: Imagine Diamond/Pearl, but a much better game. Story improved. No battle pauses! (HP bar still takes a long time to go, BUT so much of an improvement!) Fantina\\u2019s and Gardenia\\u2019s gyms are improved! Instead of Team Galactic just disappearing, CYRUS GETS KIDNAPPED! Sounds like a terrible thing to be excited about, but after the yawnfest that DP was, Platinum is AMAZING. (Plus this game doesn\\u2019t have the stupid 151 Pok\\u00e9dex like DP.) (also, nostalgic soundtrack!)\\n\\n\\nBlack/White: \\u201cOMG!! N IS SO ATTRACTIVE\\u201d \\u201cGhetsis best villain ever!!\\u201d \\u201cGREATEST GAME EVAH!!\\u201d I have nothing against these games. Love the soundtrack, love the designs and Team Plasma. But\\u2026 these games are more linear than SWSH! But at least the games have cool puzzle areas like Chargestone cave and Reversal mountain. Good Game overall. Just REALLY FLIPPIN\\u2019 Overrated.\\n\\n\\nB2W2: This is THE GAME! Team Plasma\\u2019s cooler, The gym theme\\u2019s better, and Black/White Kyurem! Also the PWT with the past gym leaders and new remixes for their theme may be Nostalgia bait, but it is MUCH BETTER NOSTALGIA BAIT THAN TEAM RAINBOW ROCKET. It makes a lot of sense honestly, who WOULDN\\u2019T wanna become world champ? Anyways, onto the games everyone seems to hate.\\n\\nX/Y: Kanto. Wait, I thought this was Kalos! Nope. There\\u2019s three sectors of the Pok\\u00e9dex. All three have exactly 151 Pok\\u00e9mon to catch. The professor gives you a Kalos starter\\u2026 and a Kanto starter. This gen introduced mega evolution! What Pok\\u00e9mon can mega evolve? Hopefully less powerful Pok\\u00e9mon that need a power boost\\u2026 let\\u2019s see. Blastoise\\u2026 Venusaur\\u2026 Gengar\\u2026 Charizard gets two? Mewtwo gets two as WELL?! Pandering. Gen 1 pandering. Anyways\\u2026 lets try to ignore that. Dreadfully easy. No difficulty options. Lysandre is cooler than Cyrus. Anyways.. There\\u2019s a story about a war and an immortal man\\u2026 it\\u2019s hard to remember, but felt sort of out of place in Pok\\u00e9mon, even though I liked it. Overall, truly great soundtrack amd improved graphics. Loved character customization (although male options stink.)\\n\\nORAS: Essentially just better Ruby/Sapphire (not emerald.)\\n\\nSun/Moon: even worse gen 1 worshiping than X/Y. Main Character is from Kanto. Only Kanto Pok\\u00e9mon get regional forms. There\\u2019s way more in USUM, just wait. Lillie. I wish she got better development than her just going to KANTO. She gave us Nebbie. Why?? \\u201cThese four tiny islands will be such a better adventure than the massive Kanto-Johto region\\u201d honestly, we just play as a camera to see Lillie\\u2019s story. Like we\\u2019re playing as the Lakitu from SM64. Remember kids when WE were the main character? Pepperidge farm remembers. The island trials were refreshing, but where\\u2019s Mina\\u2019s trial? What about that CLEARLY VISIBLE UNUSED GOLF STRIP? EH? Clearly made for Kahili. Also, I don\\u2019t mind cutscenes if they\\u2019re skipppable\\u2026 they\\u2019re not. It\\u2019s AWFUL. Every two minutes\\u2026 a cutscene! USUM IS EVEN WORSE WITH THIS! I\\u2019ll write USUM later it\\u2019s so bad. It\\u2019s so bad it manages to be worse than S/M.\\n\\nSWSH: it\\u2019s painfully easy,awkward to play. But its cutscenes are skippable! 10/10 experience after playing USUM!!\\n\\n\\u201cBrilliant\\u201d Diamond and \\u201cShining\\u201d Pearl: Essentially just fast HD Diamond and Pearl. Not platinum\\u2026 Diamond and Pearl feels like a copy/paste. Cyrus doesn\\u2019t even get kidnapped! Boo! Not a single new thing except\\u2026 clothes (a basic feature that should be in every game\\u2026 and legendaries. How original.) Note: I\\u2019ve never played this, I\\u2019m just going off what I know. And what I saw from other people playing it. Unlike the others I don\\u2019t know the exact experience playing it, I played Diamond and Pearl so I know EXACTLY WHAT IT\\u2019S LIKE playing it.\\n\\nI respect your opinons and these are just mine.

I felt like I was being raped by a horse. Push and push and it barely moved an inch. Relaxed for a couple minutes then intermittently pushed. Started panting like a woman giving birth, then relax and push again. Pant, pant, pant, puuush! I was starting to reach for the nurse emergency call button but was too embarrassed. \\u201cExcuse me but would you mind helping me remove this log out of my ass?\\u201d Thought about doing a reach around to shove it back in for another try later but decided that would be a bad idea.

Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him.

BATEMAN  Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the  nail gun.  JEAN  Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?  Jean puts her spoon down on the table.  BATEMAN  (Looking up from loading nails into the gun)  What...No! Put it in the carton.  JEAN  Sorry.  (She puts the spoon in the carton)  BATEMAN  Jean? What?  JEAN  Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?  From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and stands behind the couch.  BATEMAN  I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just  want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.  JEAN  Hmmmm.   He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head. The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun  behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman  listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch.  He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she  listens to the message.  EVELYN  Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy.  What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope  you're not out with some little number you picked up because  you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never  called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for  Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with  Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar,  auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell  Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps!  You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.  Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.  JEAN  Was that...Evelyn?  Silence.  JEAN  Are you still seeing her?  Silence.  JEAN  I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.  Silence.  JEAN  Do you want me to go?  A long pause.  BATEMAN  Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.  JEAN  I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get  involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you  want me to go?  Another long pause.  BATEMAN  If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I  think I might hurt you.  (Almost hopefully)  You don't want to get hurt, do you?  JEAN  No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised.  You're right, I should go.  She gets up to leave.  JEAN  And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with  Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.  BATEMAN  Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.  He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY   Bateman enters P&amp;P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside  the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with  Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for  a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting  the door behind him.  BATEMAN  Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come  into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?  Jean looks flustered.  Kimball follows Bateman into his office.  KIMBALL  I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's  taken a leave of absence.  BATEMAN  Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  (Hopefully)  Is he a suspect?  KIMBALL  Not really.  A pause.  KIMBALL  Do you remember where you were on the night of  Paul's disappearance?  (He checks his notebook)  Which was on the twentieth of December?  BATEMAN  God...I guess...I was probably returning  videotapes.  He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his  diary.  BATEMAN  I had a date with a girl named Veronica.  KIMBALL  Wait. That's not what I've got.  BATEMAN  What?  KIMBALL  That's not the information I've received.  BATEMAN  Well...I...Wait...What information have  you received?  KIMBALL  Let's see... (He flips through his notebook)  That you were with-  BATEMAN  Well, I could he wrong.  KIMBALL  Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?  BATEMAN  (Clearly nervous and under pressure)  We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It  was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner  at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I  physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't  remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.  Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens  his briefcase to put away his notebook.  KIMBALL  Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.  BATEMAN  Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long  day-a bit scattered.  KIMBALL  Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch  in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?  BATEMAN  Great, yes, I'd like that.  KIMBALL  And if you could try and pin down where you were  the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a  lot easier.  BATEMAN  Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.  Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a  new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.  KIMBALL  Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I  just bought it on my way here.  Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.  BATEMAN  Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.  KIMBALL  Not a big music fan, eh?  BATEMAN  No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.  KIMBALL  Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll  call your secretary about reservations.  BATEMAN  I'll be there.  EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT  The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before.  The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a  half-opened window.  CHRISTIE  I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after  last time...  BATEMAN  Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.  CHRISTIE  I don't think so.  He hands her a $500 bill.  BATEMAN  Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.   The driver's here, you'll be safe.  Christie gets in hesitantly.  BATEMAN  Nothing like last time, promise.  CHRISTIE  Alright.  He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.  BATEMAN  (Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party)  So, you're looking great, how have you been?  CHRISTIE  (A little confused)  Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.  BATEMAN  (Mock shock)  Really?  CHRISTIE  My friend told me I should maybe even get a  lawyer.  BATEMAN  Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.  He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to  her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets  quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.  BATEMAN  Bitch.  He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge  wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to  lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the  limo, she reaches for the money.  He snatches it away.  BATEMAN  Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.  She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.  BATEMAN  Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine,  Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly.  You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything  about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?  Christie nods.  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped  down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an  attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally.  Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to  examine a CD.  ELIZABETH  You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?  Christie shakes her head.  The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and  putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth  is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.  ELIZABETH  I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?  Christie looks blank.  ELIZABETH  Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.  Christie still blank.  ELIZABETH  You know, Au Bar?  Christie shakes her head.  ELIZABETH  Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.  Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses. Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at  the floor. There is an awkward silence.  CHRISTIE  This is nicer than your other apartment.  BATEMAN  (Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment)  It's not that nice.  Silence.  CHRISTIE  Where did you two meet?  ELIZABETH  Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no,  '87, and... (Turning to Patrick)  You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.  (Sarcastically)  Hot number.  BATEMAN  What do you mean, she was a hot number.  ELIZABETH  If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  (To Christie)  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?  A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.   BATEMAN  She's my...cousin.   ELIZABETH  (Skeptically)  Uh huh?   BATEMAN She's from...France.  A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.   ELIZABETH  Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.  Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares  At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.   ELIZABETH  Where do you summer? Southampton?  Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.  CHRISTIE  No.  ELIZABETH  (Listening to the receiver)  Oh God, it's his machine.  BATEMAN  Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.  ELIZABETH  He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.  BATEMAN  Don't tell him you're here.  ELIZABETH  Why would I?  Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the whole glass, making a face.  ELIZABETH  This tastes weird.  (She examines the label and shrugs) Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway  you'd like. I'm at-  BATEMAN  (Whispering)  You're at Paul Owen s.  ELIZABETH  Who?  BATEMAN  (Whispering)  Paul Owen.  ELIZABETH  I want the number, idiot.  (She waves him away and continues into the reciever)  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I  don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my  hairdresser on you.  She hangs up.  ELIZABETH  Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce  &amp; Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?  BATEMAN  No.  ELIZABETH  Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.  Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her  another glass of the drugged wine.  BATEMAN  Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.  What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.  ELIZABETH  (Laughing)  Patrick, you re a lunatic.  BATEMAN  Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?  ELIZABETH  Let's not get lewd.  (Flirty)  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.  BATEMAN  Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.  ELIZABETH  (To Christie)  Does he do this all the time?  Christie shrugs.  BATEMAN  Christie, you're not drinking your wine.  Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.  BATEMAN  (To Elizabeth)  Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?  ELIZABETH  No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?  BATEMAN  Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.  ELIZABETH  Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me  feel weird.  LATER:  Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making  out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD,  showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.  BATEMAN  Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP  called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles  on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps  across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's  mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album  on a first listening.  ELIZABETH  You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You  actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?  She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.  BATEMAN  (Ignoring her)  It's hard to choose a favorite track  among so many great ones, but \\\"The Greatest Love of All\\\"  is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about  self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message  crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope  that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder.  Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in  to empathize with others, we can always empathize with  ourselves.  As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD  in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and  watches it slide into the machine.  BATEMAN  It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's  beautifully stated on the album.  INT. BEDROOM - LATER   AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and  Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.  CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by  the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an  incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are  moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against  flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are  shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional  performance, turning her head every so often to check the  progress of her partners.  OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure,  moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then  shifts to actual pain.  Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind  Christie. There is blood on his face.  Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps  off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the  mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split  second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.  We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.  Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening  doors, looking for an escape.  She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.  She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the  door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams,  then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE  DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.  She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by  the light from a television set. Through the darkness she  sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.  She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the  main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then  runs.  Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw,  spattered with blood.  Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at  her, bellowing.  They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom.  Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the  bathtub.  Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.  Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He  tries to bite it.  She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the  front door.  He runs after her.  BATEMAN  Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you  piece of bitch trash!  Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.  Bateman runs after her.  She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.  She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the  buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.  Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.  She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her.  He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims  the chainsaw at her and drops it.  Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.  FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown  at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of  her back like a sword.  INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING   An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper  tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary  colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.  Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on  the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the  chainsaw in her back.  EVELYN  I want a firm commitment.  BATEMAN  I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.  Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.  EVELYN  (Distracted)  Why? What's wrong?  BATEMAN  (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word)  My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale  cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill  my needs.  The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.  BATEMAN  We need to talk.  EVELYN  Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk  about?  BATEMAN  It's over, Evelyn. It's all over  EVELYN  (Motioning to the waiter for water)  Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just  avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?  BATEMAN  I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This  is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.  EVELYN  But your friends are my friends. My friends are your  friends. I don't think it would work.  (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin)  You have a little something on your upper lip.  BATEMAN  (Brushing her hand away)  I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about  that. You can have them.  Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a  realization dawning.  EVELYN  You're really serious, aren't you?  BATEMAN  Yes, I am.  EVELYN  But what about the past? Our past?  BATEMAN  We never really shared one.  EVELYN  You're inhuman.  BATEMAN  I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  (He pauses, as if searching for the right words)  You're just not terribly important to me.  Evelyn begins to cry.  EVELYN  No, no, no.  BATEMAN  I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.  She reaches desperately across the table and takes his  hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.  EVELYN  (Sobbing)  What do you want me to do, what is it you want?  The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.  BATEMAN  (Looking uncomfortably around the room)  If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making  this scene right now.  EVELYN  Oh God, I can't believe this.  BATEMAN  I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.  Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the  tears so they will not affect her make-up.  EVELYN  (Surprisingly calm)  Where are you going?  BATEMAN  I'm just leaving.  EVELYN  But where?  BATEMAN  I have to return some videotapes.  He rushes out of the room.  EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING   Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.  BATEMAN  Here kitty, kitty.  The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and  walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in  the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT. Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the  deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He  takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the  kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.  WOMAN  Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?  Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming  to the floor.  Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the  distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car  screeches after him.  COP CAR (O.S.) HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.  Bateman ducks down an alley.  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT   A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from  out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away  from him.  Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of  them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He  reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.  He runs out of the alley.  EXT. STREET - NIGHT  As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS approaching.  COP CAR  Halt. Put down your weapon.  The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air.  Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.  Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the  police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light  up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living  and dead.  NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows  him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each  one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS. THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.  NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a  tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches,  the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.  INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT   He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.  NIGHT WATCHMAN  Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You  forgot to sign in.  Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the  revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he  notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He  revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.  NEW ANGLE:   He runs out of the building and across the  street to an identical office building, the one that houses  Pierce &amp; Pierce.  INT. PIERCE &amp; PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT   Bateman nods at the Pierce &amp; Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs  in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close  behind him.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT   Bateman stands looking out  through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view  of the city and the river.  Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the  opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares  everywhere, distant sirens.  Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened,  he drops to the floor behind his desk.  Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating  Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.  He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into  the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.  BATEMAN  Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my  lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of  people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some  homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in  Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin'  Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail  gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I  killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost  got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I  can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed  Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving  in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything  out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes  of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little.  Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not  sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess  I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show  up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.  Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight  circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises  up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the  sky.  INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY   KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.  KIMBALL  (Very surprised)  No hash browns?   BATEMAN  Not in the mood, I guess.  KIMBALL  But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I  mean- it's-have you been here before?  BATEMAN  (Deliberately nonchalant)  Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.  KIMBALL  (Looking at him like he's nuts)  Suit yourself, I guess.  Pause.  KIMBALL  So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on  what you did?  BATEMAN  I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some  sorbet?  KIMBALL  I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.  BATEMAN  But how? Where do you place Paul that night?  KIMBALL  According to his date book, and this was verified by his  secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.  BATEMAN  And?  KIMBALL  I've questioned him.  BATEMAN  Marcus?  KIMBALL  Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't  be sure.  BATEMAN  But Marcus denied it?  KIMBALL  Yes.  BATEMAN  Well, does Marcus have an alibi?  KIMBALL  Yes.  A pause.  BATEMAN  He does? You're sure?  KIMBALL  (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean.  BATEMAN  Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?  (He laughs)   BATEMAN  (Laughing with him)  Where was Marcus?   KIMBALL  He wasn't with Paul  Owen.   BATEMAN  So who was he with?   KIMBALL  He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,  Harry Newman, George Butner and \\u2013  (He pauses, Then looks up)  - you.  A moment of stunned silence.  BATEMAN  Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen  to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner  with Victoria...the following night.   KIMBALL  Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for  a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking.  Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or  later.  (A pause)  I mean, to think that one of his friends  killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too  ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?   McDermott stops by the table.   McDERMOTT  KIMBALL! How's the investigation?  Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.  (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back)  Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?   Bateman looks at him in silence,  panicking.   McDERMOTT  You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky  without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a  raving maniac. Been at Pierce &amp; Pierce too long.  (He wanders off muttering)  No fucking hash browns...  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY  Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He  has a surgical mask in one hand.  DOORMAN  What can I do for you, sir?  BATEMAN  20B.  DOORMAN  Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.  BATEMAN  Mrs. Wolfe?  DOORMAN  The real estate agent? You do have an appointment, don't you?  Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly  painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English  country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There  are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands  admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman  wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops  at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He  opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs.  Wolfe approaches, smiling.  MRS. WOLFE  Are you my two o'clock?  BATEMAN  No.  Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the  surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.  MRS. WOLFE  Can I help you?  BATEMAN I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.  She stares at him impassively.  BATEMAN  Doesn't he live here?  MRS. WOLFE  No, he doesn't.  BATEMAN  Are you sure?  MRS. WOLFE  You saw the ad in the Times?  BATEMAN  No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?  MRS. WOLFE  There was no ad in the Times.  Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.  MRS. WOLFE  I think you should go now.  BATEMAN  But I think...I want to know what happened  here.  MRS. WOLFE  Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.  Bateman backs away slowly.  MRS. WOLFE  Don't come back.  BATEMAN  I won't...don't worry.  Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall,  rattled, and gets into the elevator.  EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY   Bateman enters the revolving  door of an office building, panicking and breathing  heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks  deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes  out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY  just like him.  GUY  Hey, Kinsley.  Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.  GUY  See you at Fluties, okay?  The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down  the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage  cans, etc.  EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY   Bateman searches his pockets  for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows  them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his  face, dialing a number.  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick Bateman's office.  BATEMAN  Jean? Hello? Jean?  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick? Is that you?  BATEMAN  Hello? Jean, I need help!  JEAN (O.S.) Where are you?  BATEMAN  Jean-I'm not-  JEAN (O.S.)  Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and  David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.  BATEMAN  Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick? I can't hear you.  BATEMAN  What are I doing?  JEAN (O.S.)  Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?  BATEMAN  I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.  Pause.  BATEMAN  ...to the office this afternoon.  JEAN (O.S.)  Why?  BATEMAN  (Screaming)  Just...say...no!  JEAN (O.S.)  What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?  BATEMAN  Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!  He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck  into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his  jacket.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY   Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens  his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.  INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING   Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the  previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking  and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down,  still breathing heavily.  Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.  McDERMOTT  Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough  day at the office?  They all laugh.  McDERMOTT  Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking  Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't  get a reservation to save his life.  Bateman sits down silently.  McDERMOTT  Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.  BATEMAN  (On automatic)  I'm not going anywhere unless we  have a reservation.  VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on,  faggots-just get a res.  PRICE  Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.  Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.   BATEMAN  (He downs his drink)  Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.   CARNES  Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the  end of the '90s.  Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.  BATEMAN  Shut up, Carnes, they will not.  Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.  BATEMAN  So, Harold, did you get my message?  Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.  CARNES  Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you,  wasn't it?  BATEMAN  (Waving smoke out of his face)  Yes, naturally.  CARNES  Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s  fabulous. That's rich...  Pause  CARNES  It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?  BATEMAN  What exactly do you mean?  CARNES  The message you left.  Carnes is distracted, waving at people.  CARNES  By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still  seeing her, right?  BATEMAN  But wait, Harold, what do you mean?  Carnes isn't really listening.  CARNES  Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?  He turns to go.  BATEMAN  Carnes? Wait.  CARNES  (Sighing)  Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing.  But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork,  such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully  appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said  Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's  have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.  BATEMAN  What are you talking about? Bateman is what?  CARNES  Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let  alone...what was it you said he did to her?  Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing  couple. He laughs politely.  CARNES  Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...  BATEMAN  (Desperate, shouting)  Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really  comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes.  I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off.  I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your  machine was true.  CARNES  Excuse me. I really must he going.  BATEMAN  No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm  Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!  Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.  Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.  BATEMAN  Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed  Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer  CARNES  But that's simply not possible. And I don't find  this funny anymore.  BATEMAN  It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?  CARNES  (Eyeing Bateman worriedly) It's just not.  BATEMAN  Why not, you stupid bastard?  Carnes stares at him.  CARNES  Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in  London...just ten days ago.  BATEMAN  No, you...didn't?  CARNES  Now, if you'll excuse me.  Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze. They are all looking at the television, where Ronald  Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are  halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's  lying.  PRICE  How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?  VAN PATTEN  What shit? Now where do we have reservations at?  I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have  reservations somewhere.  PRICE  (To Bateman)  I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.  McDERMOTT  He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that  shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know,  what can I say?  PRICE  I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that  way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so  fucking, I don't know, cool about it?  VAN PATTEN  Some guys are just born cool, I guess.  Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.  PRICE  And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?  BATEMAN  I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  (To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal.  Working for UNICEF now?  McDERMOTT  Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?  PRICE  Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless  Old codger. But inside...  Pause.  PRICE  But inside...  The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:  BATEMAN (V.O.)  But inside doesn't matter...  THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.  McDERMOTT  (Bored) Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually  listening to you.  PRICE  Bateman? Come on, what do you think?   Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.  BATEMAN  Whatever.  The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.   VAN PATTEN  Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.  The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs  over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of  other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking  on portable phones, talking, laughing,  BATEMAN (V.O.) There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with  the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil,  all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward  it, I have now surpassed...  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY  Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary.  We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with  doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost  and frightened, and begins to cry.  BATEMAN (V.O.) My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better  world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on  others. I want no escape.  INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING  As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is  leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch,  his eyes blank.  BATEMAN (V.O.) But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no  deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted  from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any  of this. This confession has meant nothing...  The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:  \\\"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.\\\"  CREDITS ROLL\",\n",

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.  KIMBALL  Would you rather I not smoke?  BATEMAN  No, I guess it's okay.  KIMBALL  You sure?  BATEMAN  No problem.  (Buzzing Jean)  JEAN (O.S.)  Yes, Patrick?  BATEMAN  Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.  KIMBALL  What can you tell me about Paul Owen?  BATEMAN  Well...  He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows  them dry.  KIMBALL  How well did you know him?  BATEMAN  I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing,  you know.  KIMBALL  Yale thing?  A pause.  BATEMAN  Yeah...Yale thing.  KIMBALL  What do you mean...Yale thing?  A pause.  BATEMAN  Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet  homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.  A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner  becomes deafening.  KIMBALL  So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul  Owen?  BATEMAN  He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.  KIMBALL  What kind of man was he? Besides... (He hesitates tries to smile)  the information you've just given.  BATEMAN  I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.  KIMBALL  Do you feel that way?  BATEMAN  No. Not really.  KIMBALL  (As he writes without looking up)  Where did Paul hang out?  BATEMAN  Hang...out?  KIMBALL  Yeah. You know...hang out.  BATEMAN  Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular  places.  KIMBALL  He had a yacht?  BATEMAN  No, he just hung out there.  KIMBALL  And where did he go to school?  A slight pause.  BATEMAN  Don't you know this?  KIMBALL  I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN  Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.  KIMBALL  I understand.  He makes another note.  KIMBALL  Anything else you can tell me about Owen?  BATEMAN  We were both seven in 1969.  KIMBALL  (Smiles)  So was I.  BATEMAN  Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?  KIMBALL  Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he  went to London.  BATEMAN  Well, maybe he did, huh?  KIMBALL  His girlfriend doesn't think so.  BATEMAN  But...has anyone seen him in London?  KIMBALL  Actually, yes.  BATEMAN  Hmmm.  KIMBALL  Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification.  A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but  I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert  Ainsworth for Paul, so...  BATEMAN  Oh.  KIMBALL  Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?  BATEMAN  What?  KIMBALL  I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I  know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't  know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was  recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano  girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-  BATEMAN  Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced  diet and-  KIMBALL  Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.  A pause - the longest so far.  BATEMAN  Have you consulted a psychic?  KIMBALL  No.  BATEMAN  Had his apartment been burglarized?  KIMBALL  No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A  suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.  BATEMAN  I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet  or anything, right?  KIMBALL  No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.  BATEMAN  That's so typical, isn't it?  KIMBALL  It's just strange.  (He stares out the window, lost in thought)  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive,  and then...  BATEMAN  Nothing.  KIMBALL  People just...disappear.  BATEMAN  The earth just opens up and swallows people.  (He checks his Rolex)  KIMBALL  Eerie. Really eerie.  Silence.  BATEMAN  (Standing up)  You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting  with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.  KIMBALL  Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I  mean aren't you going to be late?  BATEMAN  Uh, no. There's one...down here.  KIMBALL  Oh really? I didn't know that.  Bateman leads him to the door.  BATEMAN  Yes. It's very good.  KIMBALL turns to face him.  KIMBALL  Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information  at all...  BATEMAN  Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.  KIMBALL  Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.  Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his  eyes and leans against the door, sweating.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON   A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian,  a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect  green grapes, a few berries.  OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard  from the living room.  The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal  crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw  Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table,  next to a copy of GQ.  LATER:  Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand,  jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.  BATEMAN  You like that, slut?  The person on the other end clearly hangs up.  CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.  BATEMAN  You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar  boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white  cotton T-shirt by  Commes des Garcons.  (He snorts like a pig)  My Rolex cost-  Another hang-up. He dials again.  BATEMAN  (Whipering)  I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do  you think of that?  (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts)  Huh, bitch?  GIRL (O.S.) Dad, is that you?  Bateman hangs up, frustrated.  EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT   Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside  CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket.  Bateman opens his window to speak to her.  BATEMAN  I haven't seen you around here.  CHRISTIE  You just haven't been looking.  BATEMAN  Would you like to see my apartment?  Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a  tuxedo.  CHRISTIE  (looking away to some dark corner)  I'm not supposed to.  Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now  notices, then takes.  BATEMAN  Do you want to come to my apartment or not?  CHRISTIE  I'm not supposed to.  (She pockets the bill)  But I can make an exception.  BATEMAN  Do you take American Express?  Christie is still looking out behind her.  BATEMAN  Do you take American Express?  Christie looks at him like he's crazy.  BATEMAN  I'm joking. Come on, get in.  As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He  reads off a credit card number.  BATEMAN  I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does  couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the  American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really  can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.  He hangs up.  BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that?  You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is  that clear?  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white  milky bath oil.  BATEMAN  That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.  Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and  Bateman is casually touching her breast.  BATEMAN  I want you to clean your vagina.  Christie reaches for a washcloth.  BATEMAN  No. From behind. Get on your knees.  Christie shrugs.  BATEMAN  I want to watch. You have a very nice body.  The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.  BATEMAN  Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry  off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and  our guest in the living room for drinks.  Bateman answers the door.  BATEMAN  You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat.  I'm Paul. How good of you to come.  The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes  her coat and inspects her body and face.  BATEMAN  Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm  going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.  Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a  glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the  couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a  long silence.  BATEMAN  So, don't you want to know what I do?  The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles.  Christie shrugs.  CHRISTIE  No.  SABRINA  (Smiling)  No, not really.  Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.  BATEMAN  Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce &amp; Pierce.  (Long pause)  Have you heard of it?  Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands  up and goes over to the CD collection.  CHRISTIE  You have a really nice place here...Paul.  How much did you pay for it?  BATEMAN  Actually, that's none of your business, Christie,  hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.  Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a  pack of cigarettes out of her purse. Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.  BATEMAN  No, no smoking. Not in here.  He walks over to Christie.  BATEMAN  Varda truffle?  Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina  takes one.  BATEMAN  I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very  fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.  Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection.  He takes one out and examines it.  BATEMAN  Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis  fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before  that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too  artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins'  presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out  another one.  BATEMAN  I think \\\"Invisible Touch\\\" is the group's undisputed masterpiece.  He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him  into the bedroom.  BATEMAN  It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the  same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding  three albums. Christie, take off the robe.  Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to  put it on.  BATEMAN  Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks,  Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance  of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.  Bateman starts to undress.  BATEMAN  In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer  songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.  Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?  Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.  BATEMAN  Take the lyrics to \\\"Land of Confusion.\\\" In this  song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political  authority.  Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather  menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.   BATEMAN  \\\"In Too Deep\\\" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about  monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting.  Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything  I've heard in rock.  He turns on the video camera.   BATEMAN  Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your  asshole.  Bateman looks through the viewfinder.  BATEMAN  Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and  therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially  songs like \\\"In the Air Tonight\\\" and \\\"Against  All Odds.\\\" Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.   He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in  the CD.  BATEMAN  But I also think that Phill Collins works better  within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and  I stress the word artist. This is \\\"Sussudio,\\\" a great,  great song, a personal favorite.  SEX MONTAGE CUT TO \\\"Sussudio.\\\" We see this in WIDE SHOT, or  through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.  CUT TO:   Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina  on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his  wrist. Bateman's eyes open.  BATEMAN  Don't touch the Rolex.  Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.  He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger,  a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns  around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up  and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.  BATEMAN  We're not through yet...  CUT TO:  Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They  are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a  deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the  b.g. Phil Collins' \\\"In the Air Tonight\\\" is playing.  INT. YALE CLUB \\u2013 DAY   McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are  having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and  gives them the finger.  BATEMAN  What an asshole.  McDERMOTT  Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a  fucking drug addict. No self-control.  VAN PATTEN  But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do  you think, Bateman?  BATEMAN  I know her. I knew her.  McDERMOTT  Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it  like that?  VAN PATTEN  Because he dated her.  BATEMAN  How did you guess?  VAN PATTEN  Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ,  Bateman.  BATEMAN  Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy  personality.  McDERMOTT  So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a  babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other  reason.  VAN PATTEN  If they have a good personality, then something  is very wrong.  McDERMOTT  If they have a good personality and they are not  great looking-who fucking cares?  BATEMAN  Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if  they have a good personality?  (He smiles giving up)  I know, I know-  ALL IN UNISON There are no girls with good personalities!  (They laugh and high-five each other)  VAN PATTEN  A good personality consists of a chick with a  little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without  being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep  her dumb fucking mouth  shut.  McDERMOTT  Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even  talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly  chicks.  VAN PATTEN  Absolutely.  McDERMOTT  And this is because they have to make up for how  fucking unattractive they are.  Pause.  BATEMAN  Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?  VAN PATTEN  Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?  BATEMAN  No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was  an interesting guy.  McDERMOTT  So what did Ed say?  BATEMAN  He said, \\\"When I see a pretty girl walking down the  street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her  out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat  her right.\\\"  Pauses, finishes his drink.  McDERMOTT  What does the other part of him think?  BATEMAN  What her head would look like on a stick.  McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back  at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily join In.  Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.  CARRUTHERS  (Shyly)  Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.  McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.  McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you  know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.  CARRUTHERS  Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to  get a new one too.  He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone  compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear  is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously.  Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with  himself.  VAN PATTEN  Listen, what about dinner?  BATEMAN  (Suddenly angry)  Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? \\\"What about  fucking dinner?\\\"   McDERMOTT  Ah, cheer up, Bateman.  (Slaps him on the back, massages his neck)  What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?   BATEMAN  (Watching Luis going into the men's room)  Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.  McDERMOTT  Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.  BATEMAN  Excuse me.  He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van  Patten grabs a waiter.  VAN PATTEN  Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring  me an Evian or something, okay?  INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY   Bateman pulls on his gloves as he  enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his  back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman  approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands  up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his  neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear  is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to  squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.  Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in  thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's  wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck  expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side  of his face.  CARRUTHERS  God, Patrick. Why here?  He strokes Bateman's hair.  CARRUTHERS  I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.  Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs  away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers  immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops  them again.  CARRUTHERS  Don't be shy.  Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift  his hands again, but abandons the attempt.  CARRUTHERS  You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas  party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that  red-striped paisley Armani tie.  Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are  still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and  stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he  realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up  behind him.  CARRUTHERS  I want you. I want you...too.  Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter  and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d'  and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely,  Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at  them. Carruthers walks up behind him.  BATEMAN  (Hissing)  What...is...it?  CARRUTHERS  Where are you going?  BATEMAN  (Stumbling away from him)  I've gotta...I've  gotta...return some videotapes.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick?  BATEMAN  What? CARRUTHERS  (Silently mouthing the words)  I'll call you.  Bateman storms out of the restaurant.  INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex.  Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels  something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy,  a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.  COURTNEY  Will you call me before Thanksgiving?  BATEMAN  Maybe.  Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her  nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins  to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches  the TV at low volume.  COURTNEY  What are you doing tonight?  BATEMAN  Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.  COURTNEY  That's nice.  BATEMAN  You and...Luis?  COURTNEY  (Lighting a cigarette)  We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and  Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...  BATEMAN  I never knew you smoked.  COURTNEY  (Smiling sadly)  You never noticed.  Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.  COURTNEY  Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?  BATEMAN  You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're  going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.  COURTNEY  (Sarcastically)  Isn't that special?  (A pause)  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Yes, Courtney?  C0URTNEY  If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?  BATEMAN  (Flatly)  You too.  Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its  head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.  COURTNEY  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Yes?  COURTNEY  Nothing.  INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT   A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop  kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.  I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and  tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a  suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.  KIMBALL  Mr. Bateman?  Bateman gasps and recovers.  BATEMAN  Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL  Kimball.  (Extending his hand)  Call me Don.  BATEMAN  Don.  KIMBALL  So...you hang out here a lot?  BATEMAN  Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You  know.  Pause.  BATEMAN  How's the investigation going? Taken anyone  in for \\\"formal questioning?\\\" (He makes quotation marks  in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)  KIMBALL  0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?  BATEMAN  Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.  KIMBALL  (Looking at his glass)  Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much  more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting,  don't you think?  Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.  KIMBALL  Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?  Bateman shakes his head.  KIMBALL  I mean they want to get caught.  BATEMAN  Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need  anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean  Owen was a...complex man.  Bateman wanders away.  He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from  the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.  BATEMAN  (Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!  The man stares at him.  BATEMAN  I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...  The man walks by, shaking his head.  Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a  more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in  black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott  and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black  mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered  argument.  PRICE  I have to talk to these girls? They're models.  McDERMOTT  Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder.  You went last time. Stay here.  McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears. Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring  into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to  unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.  PRICE  (Clapping his hands together)  Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?  Silence.  LIBBY  Where did Craig go?  PRICE  Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to  sign a peace treaty with him between the United States  and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.  LIBBY  Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.  PRICE  You're not confused, are you?  LIBBY  No, not really.  CARON  Gorbachev's not downstairs.  DAISY  (Smiling)  Are you Iying?  PRICE  Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's  at Tunnel.  BATEMAN  (To Daisy)  Ask me a question.  DAISY  So, what do you do?  BATEMAN  What do you think I do?  DAISY  A model? An actor?  BATEMAN  No. Flattering, but no.  DAISY  Well...  BATEMAN  I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.  DAISY (Unfazed)  Do you like it?  BATEMAN  Welt...it depends, why?  DAISY  Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and  acquisitions don't really like it.  Silence.  BATEMAN  So, where do you work out?  MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:   The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a  balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him  in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over  the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman  is reaching for him.  PRICE  (Shouting) I'm leaving. I'm getting out.  BATEMAN  Leaving what?  PRICE  This.  Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his  drink.  BATEMAN  Don't, I'll drink it.  PRICE  (Screaming)  Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.  BATEMAN  Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?  PRICE  I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!  BATEMAN  Don't tell me...merchant banking?  PRICE  No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm  disappearing.  BATEMAN  (laughing)  Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?  Price looks away.  McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.  McDERMOTT  Hey-don't worry, be happy.  Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is  shouting something that can't be heard, then  PRICE  Goodbye! Fuckheads!  He climbs over the railing.  DAISY What is he doing?  BATEMAN  Price! Come back!  Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment  then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.  EXT. CLUB - NIGHT  Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.  DAISY  My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays  in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand  what I was doing with a yuppie.  BATEMAN  Oh really? DAISY  He said... (She laughs)  He said you gave him bad vibes.  BATEMAN  That's...that's too bad.  DAISY  You think I'm dumb, don't you?  BATEMAN  What?  DAISY  You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.  BATEMAN  (insincerely) No. I really don't.  DAISY  That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.  She takes his hand as they get into a cab.  INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT   Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses  in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the  case.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON   Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York  Times crossword puzzle at dusk.  Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with  a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.  JEAN  Doin' the crossword?  Bateman nods without looking up.  JEAN  Need help?  BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the  puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean  drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.  BATEMAN  Jean?  JEAN  (Re-enters office)  Yes, Patrick?  BATEMAN  Would you like to accompany me to dinner?  He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.  BATEMAN  That is...if you're not doing anything.  JEAN  Oh no. I have no plans.  BATEMAN  (Lowering his Wayfarers)  Well, isn't this a coincidence.  A pause.  BATEMAN  Listen, where should we go?  He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.  JEAN  Anywhere you want?  BATEMAN  Let's not think about what I want. How about  anywhere you want.  JEAN  Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.  BATEMAN  No, come on. Anywhere you want.  JEAN  Oh, I can't.  (Sighs)  I don't know.  BATEMAN  Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.  A long pause.  JEAN  What about...Dorsia?  Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles  at her.  BATEMAN  Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...  JEAN  Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.  BATEMAN  Dorsia is...fine.  He dials the number.  MAITRE D' Dorsia, yes?  BATEMAN  Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at  nine o'clock?  He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.  MAITRE D' We are totally booked.  BATEMAN  Oh really? That's great.  MAITRE D'  I said we are totally booked.  BATEMAN  Two at nine? Perfect.  MAITRE D'  There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is  also totally booked.  BATEMAN  See you then.  He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He  glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the  desk, confused.  BATEMAN  Yes? You're dressed...okay.  JEAN  You didn't give them a name.  BATEMAN  They know me.  Pause.  BATEMAN  Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock  for drinks, okay?  She turns to leave.  BATEMAN  And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING   Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.  JEAN  Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.  Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady  visible.  BATEMAN  Jean? Sorbet?  JEAN  Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.  Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in  his hand and hands her the sorbet.  Jean is eating the sorbet.  JEAN  Want a bite?  BATEMAN  I'm on a diet. But thank you.  JEAN  You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right?  You look great. Very fit.  BATEMAN  (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness)  You can always he thinner. Look...better.  JEAN  Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't  want to ruin your willpower.  BATEMAN  No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling  it anyway.  Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up  his knife drawer, looking at the knives.  BATEMAN  So listen, what do you really want to do with your  life?  Pause.  BATEMAN  And don't tell me you enjoy working with children,  okay?  JEAN  Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school,  but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life  where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.  Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge  of the blade.  BATEMAN  Do you have a boyfriend?  JEAN  No, not really.  BATEMAN  Interesting.  JEAN  (Shyly)  Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?  BATEMAN  Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very  Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape,  twine and a nail gun.  BATEMAN  Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?  JEAN  Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused  on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about  changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.  BATEMAN  Growing. I'm glad you said that.  Bateman picks up the duct tape.\",\n",

But this is TOTALLY different than any horror game that I've ever played.

STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT   It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the  comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine.  Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk  past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his  wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up  to her as she pauses at a red light.  BATEMAN  Hello.  The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing  his smile, smiles back.  INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY   Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit  with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry  cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the  counter.  BATEMAN  Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons.  The woman continues to speak to him in another language,  grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.  BATEMAN  What are you trying to say to me?  Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained  sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.  BATEMAN  Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?  Bleach-ee. Oh my God.  She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.  BATEMAN  (Talking over her)  Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.  Two. (Louder)  Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very  expensive sheets and I really need them clean.  She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.  BATEMAN  If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill  you, are you understanding me?  She talks faster.  BATEMAN  Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting  (Checks Rolex)  at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those  ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at  Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need  those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.  She keeps talking.  BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.  Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the  counter.  BATEMAN  This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with  this.  Bateman is on the verge of tears.  BATEMAN  Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!  Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA,  late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a  tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.  VICTORIA  Patrick?  She takes off her sunglasses.  VICTORIA  Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.  BATEMAN  Hello  (Mumbles un incomprehensible name)  Awkward pause.  BATEMAN  Well.  VICTORIA  Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here,  but you know. They really are the best.  BATEMAN  Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk  to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.  Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding  up. She touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking  again.  VICTORIA  Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my. BATEMAN  Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.  VICTORiA  (Skeptically) Really?  BATEMAN  Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You  know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?  VICTORIA  (As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it.  Fun with chocolate.  BATEMAN  Listen, if you could talk to them  (He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand)  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a  lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.  Bateman turns to leave.  VICTORIA  Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?  BATEMAN  Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank  you, uh... Victoria?  VICTORIA  Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You  know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.  BATEMAN  Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the  time.  VICTORIA  Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?  BATEMAN  (Checking his watch)  Next Saturday?  VICTORIA  (Shrugging)  Yeah.  BATEMAN  Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin\\u00e9e of Les Miserables.  Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call  you.  VICTORIA  Okay. Do.  Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes  out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound  of the bell on the closing door.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY  Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to  Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one  hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear  the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.  BATEMAN  Listen, what are you doing tonight?  COURTNEY  What? Oh, I'm...busy.  BATEMAN  Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me,  and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to  tonight?  COURTNEY  Stop it. I'm...  BATEMAN  On a lot of lithium?  COURTNEY  Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call  tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.  BATEMAN  You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY  But-when?  BATEMAN  Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?  COURTNEY  Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I  need to be home for that.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin?  COURTNEY  Yes?  BATEMAN  Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.  COURTNEY  Uh huh.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New  York.  COURTNEY  I know. Stop it.  BATEMAN  Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling  dickweed.  COURTNEY  Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.  BATEMAN  Courtney? Dinner?  COURTNEY  I can't.  BATEMAN  I'm thinking Dorsia.  COURTNEY  Dorsia's nice.  BATEMAN  Nice?  COURTNEY  You like it there, don't you?  BATEMAN  The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will  you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a  boyfriend to eat there tonight.  COURTNEY  Okay. Yeah. What time?  BATEMAN  Eight?   COURTNEY  Pick me up?   BATEMAN  Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear  something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?  Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the  number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so  he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with  his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there  is finally an answer.  MAITRE D' Dorsia. Please hold.  He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.  MAITRE D' Dorsia.  BATEMAN  (Both of his eyes are closed)  Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to  reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?  Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then  more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he  hangs up the phone.  INT. TAXI- NIGHT  Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is heavily medicated.  COURTNEY  A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really  relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this  silver muffin dish.  (She starts to pass out)  BATEMAN  Is that Donald Trump's car?  COURTNEY  (Thickly)  Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.  BATEMAN  You know, Courtney, you should take some more  lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you  out of this slump.  COURTNEY  I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... (Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)  The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads  \\\"Barcadia.\\\"  INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT   An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all  polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths,  minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.  A waiter has come to take their drink orders.  BATEMAN J&amp;B. Straight.  COURTNEY  Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with  a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman  leans over and pulls her back up.  COURTNEY  Are we here?  BATEMAN  Yes.  COURTNEY  This is Dorsia?  BATEMAN  (Examining a menu that says \\\"Barcadia\\\" in large script)  Yes, dear.  Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and  starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both  shoulders and props her up.  BATEMAN  Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter  soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine  called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish.\\\" You'll  love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and  pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.   COURTNEY  Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.   She falls asleep at the table.  INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on  top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears  it open with his teeth, puts it on.  COURTNEY  (Dazed on lithium)  I want you to fuck me.  Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.  COURTNEY  Luis is a despicable twit.  BATEMAN  Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.  He keeps fucking her.  COURTNEY  No, you idiot. I said \\\"Is it a receptacle tip?\\\"  Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip?  Get off me.  BATEMAN  Is it a what?  COURTNEY  Pull out.  BATEMAN  I'm ignoring you.  COURTNEY  (screaming)  Pull out, goddamnit!  BATEMAN  (Slowing down but not stopping) What do you want, Courtney?  She pushes him away from her.  BATEMAN  It's a plain end. I think.  COURTNEY  Turn the light on.  She tries to sit up.  BATEMAN  Oh Jesus. I'm going home.  COURTNEY  Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.   BATEMAN  It's a plain end, see? So?   COURTNEY  Take it off.   BATEMAN  Why?   COURTNEY  Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip \\u2013  (She covers herself with her comforter)  to catch the force of the ejaculate!  BATEMAN  I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?  Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.   COURTNEY  (Screaming)  Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?  Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.  BATEMAN  Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see,  Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  (He slaps her again lightly)  Why is it pulled down half an inch?  So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!  COURTNEY  (Choking crying)  Well, it's not a turn-on for me.  I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.  Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.  BATEMAN  See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?  COURTNEY  Oh God, just get it over with.  He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and  falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their  bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the  ceiling.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY  Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in  the conference room at Pierce &amp; Pierce, which looks out onto  a spectacular view of Manhattan.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a  reservation there?  BATEMAN  Lucky, I guess.  CARRUTHERS  That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,  Valentino Couture?  BATEMAN  Uh huh.  CARRUTHERS  (Reaching out to touch it)  It looks so soft.  BATEMAN  (Catching Luis hand)  Your compliment was sufficient Luis.  Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague  on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal  under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and  self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.  OWEN  (To Bateman)  Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?  BATEMAN  I've been great. And you?  Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's  thoughts.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam.  It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P and in  fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a  penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.  Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have  a slightly better haircut.  During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS  HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the  opposite corner of the room. He bears a  superficial resemblance to Bateman.  OWEN  How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?  BATEMAN  (Nervous)  It's...it's...all right.  OWEN  Really? That's interesting.  (He stares at Bateman, smiling) Not great?  BATEMAN  Oh well, you know.  OWEN  And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.  BATEMAN  Oh yes. I'm very lucky.  McDermott and Price enter.  McDERMOTT  Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.  OWEN  Thank you, Baxter.  PRICE  Listen, Paul. Squash?  OWEN  Call me.  (Hands him a business card)  PRICE  How about Friday?  OWEN  No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea  urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away  and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.  CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.  PRICE (Whispering)  Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?  McDERMOTT (Whispering)  I think he's lying.  Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.   PRICE  (Suddenly enthused)  What's that, a gram?   BATEMAN  New card. What do you think?  McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully.   McDERMOTT  Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.  He hands it to Van Patten.  BATEMAN  Picked them up from the printers yesterday  VAN PATTEN  Good coloring.  BATEMAN  That's bone. And the lettering is something called  Silian Rail.  McDERMOTT  (Envious)  Silian Rail?  VAN PATTEN  It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.  He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the  table.   VAN PATTEN  Look at this.  They all lean forward to inspect it.   PRICE  That's really nice.  Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to  control his anxiety.  VAN PATTEN  Eggshell with Romalian type.  (Turning to Bateman) What do you think?  BATEMAN  (Barely able to breath, his voice a croak)  Nice.  PRICE  (Holding the card up to the light)  Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so  tasteful?  Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at  McDermott's.   BATEMAN (V.O.) I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.  PRICE  But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.   He holds up his own card.   PRICE  Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...  BATEMAN  (Choking with anxiety)  Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.  Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it  up for their inspection: \\\"PAUL OWEN, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE,  MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.\\\" Bateman swallows, speechless.  The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint  heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness  of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...  His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it  until it fills the screen.  He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.  CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.  EXT. STREET- EVENING   The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.  Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of  $500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns  to leave, he notices someone across the street.  A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open  grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A  cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM  HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies  next to him.  He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green  polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.  BATEMAN  (Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.  The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.  BATEMAN  You want some money?. Some...food?  The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches  into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his  mind and holds out a $5 instead.  BATEMAN  Is this what you need?  The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  BATEMAN  It's cold out, too, isn't it?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  BATEMAN  (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach)  Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you  get a job?  HOMELESS MAN  (Shivering and sobbing)  I lost my job...  BATEMAN  Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it?  Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on  the job?  HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.  BATEMAN  Gee, uh, that's too bad.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm so hungry.  The dog starts to whimper.  BATEMAN  Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm not...  BATEMAN  You're not what? Qualified for anything else?  HOMELESS MAN  I'm hungry  BATEMAN  I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record.  I'm trying to help you.  HOMELESS MAN  I'm hungry.  BATEMAN  Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who  do have jobs? From people who do work?  HOMELESS MAN  What am I gonna do?  BATEMAN  Listen, what's your name?  HOMELESS MAN Al.  BATEMAN  Speak up. Come on.  HOMELESS MAN Al.  BATEMAN  Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude.  That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together.  I'll help you.  HOMELESS MAN  You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.  BATEMAN  (Petting the dog)  Shhhh...it's okay.  HOMELESS MAN  (Grabbing Bateman's wrist)  Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.  BATEMAN  (Stroking his face, whispering)  Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.  HOMELESS MAN  I can't...I can't find a shelter  BATEMAN  You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of  faggot. Al...I'm sorry.  Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.  BATEMAN  It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common  with you.  He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with  a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to  protect it.  BATEMAN  Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?  HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.  EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach. The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is  silent.  LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.  BATEMAN There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.  Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street.  Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the  body left twitching on the ground.  INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY   CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a  woman's hands rub cream into his face.  FACIALIST  What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So  fine, so smooth...  His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he  closes them again.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood,  skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except  for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside  me and I don't know why.  CUT TO:  Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the  MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his  nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal,  on the verge of frenzy.  CUT TO:  Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning  bed, wearing goggles.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.  INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT   An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an  ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets,  naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.  Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.  BATEMAN  Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?  MAITRE D' Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.  Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of  ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.  OWEN  No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro  crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one  could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the  way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten  people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of  cilantro crawfish gumbo?  WAITER  I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen  earlier today, and-  BATEMAN  J&amp;B, straight. And a Dixie beer.  WAITER  Would you like to hear-  OWEN  Double Absolut martini.  WAITER  Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?  BATEMAN  Not if you want to keep your spleen.  The Waiter leaves.  OWEN  This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.   This place is hot, very hot.  BATEMAN  Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous  here.  OWEN  Yeah, well, you're late.  BATEMAN  Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  (Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood)  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.  OWEN  We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.  BATEMAN  Nobody goes there anymore.  There is a long disgruntled silence.  BATEMAN  Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez  Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana  be at Texarkana?  Another pause.  BATEMAN  So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the  Fisher account? How did you get it?  OWEN  I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have  to kill you.  He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.  LATER:  Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.  BATEMAN  I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?  Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another  drink.  OWEN  Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?  BATEMAN Salon.  OWEN  I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.  Bateman nods, agitated.  OWEN  And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?  BATEMAN  Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think  she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.  OWEN  Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick  Bateman. What a dork.  BATEMAN  Another Martini, Paul?  Owen nods drunkenly.  LATER:  The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the  table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid  down.  BATEMAN  (Talking to Owen like a child)  Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.  BATEMAN  Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave  a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?  OWEN  No, man. I'm gonna bail.  BATEMAN  Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  (Helping him into his jacket)  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a  bottle of Absolut waiting for us.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The living room floor has been meticulously covered with  newspaper.  Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass  in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.  BATEMAN  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  OWEN  They're okay. BATEMAN  Their early work was a little too New Wave for my  taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really  came into their own, commercially and artistically.  Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. He takes two Valium.  BATEMAN  (Said partly from the bathroom)  The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of  consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall.  He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen  from behind ail the time.  BATEMAN  He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think  Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys  catalogue.  OWEN  Hey, Halberstam?  BATEMAN  Yes, Owen?  OWEN  Why are there copies of the Style section all over  the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?  BATEMAN  No, Owen.  OWEN  (Confused)  Is that a raincoat?  BATEMAN  Yes, it is.  Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its  case and slides it in the machine.  BATEMAN  In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most  accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is  \\\"HiP To Be Square,\\\" a song so catchy that most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not  just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of  trends. It's al\\\\~ a personal statement about the band itself.  Bateman puts on \\\"Hip To Be Square.\\\"  BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.  We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the  ax raised over his head.  BATEMAN  Hey, Paul?  As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing  the ax toward his face.  Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.  FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.  Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame.  We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.  Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.  BATEMAN  (Raising the ax and screaming)  Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking  stupid bastard!  LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the  ax.  OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.  BATEMAN  (Panting)  Fucking bastard...  Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the  coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly  over the back of a chair.  He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He  checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.  OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.  INT. LOBBY - NIGHT   BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby,  past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.  EXT. STREET - NIGHT  BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his  feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick? Is that you?  BATEMAN  No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.  CARRUTHERS  This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good  friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to  Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  (Looking down at the body)  Where did you get your overnight bag?  BATEMAN  Commes des Garcon.  A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get  Owen's body into the backseat.  Bateman gets into the cab.  CARRUTHERS  Call me please, Patrick.  BATEMAN  Jesus lives, Luis.  INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT   A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank  except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.  Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in  a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the  body dissolve.  INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT   Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very  similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls  are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting  on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale  scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.  BATEMAN  Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?  He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing  toiletries and shoving them in.  BATEMAN  Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.  He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans  over the answering machine.  He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.  BATEMAN  Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London  for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.  Hasta la vista, baby.  INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING   Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of  Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing  Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes  the Walkman off.  BATEMAN  (Faintly irritable)  What is it?  JEAN  Patrick?  BATEMAN  (Condescendingly)  Ye-es, Je-an?  JEAN  Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.  BATEMAN  Who?  JEAN  Detective Donald KIMBALL?  Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the  drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back  cover of Sports Illustrated.  BATEMAN  Tell him I'm at lunch.  JEAN  (whispering)  Patrick, I think he knows you're here.  It's only ten-thirty.   Silence.   BATEMAN  Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless  phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.  BATEMAN  Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion  to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good  buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt  calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...  The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD  KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age -  and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of  the type Bateman and his friends might wear.  Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a  self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to  carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at  him curiously, noticing the silence.  BATEMAN  (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him)  Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.  Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in  exasperation.   KIMBALL nods understandingly.  BATEMAN  Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just  walked in... (He laughs inanely)  Just joking... (Pause)  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John,  right, got it.  (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in)  Sorry about that.  KIMBALL  No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  (Gesturing toward the phone)  Was that anything important?  BATEMAN  Oh that? Just mulling over business problems.  Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.  They laugh politely.  KIMBALL  (Holding out his hand)  Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL  BATEMAN  (Shaking firmly)  Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.  KIMBALL  I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed  to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well,  you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.  KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports  Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk.  Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines  into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is  still running.  BATEMAN  (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed)  So, what's the topic of discussion?  KIMBALL  I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate  the disappearance of Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?  KIMBALL  Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.  BATEMAN  Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.  KIMBALL  So it's nothing that official. I just have some  basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-  BATEMAN  Coffee?  KIMBALL  No. I'm okay.  BATEMAN  Perrier? San Pellegrino?  KIMBALL  No, I'm okay.  KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold  Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes  Jean.  JEAN (O.S.)  Patrick?  BATEMAN  Can you bring Mr...  KIMBALL  KIMBALL.  BATEMAN  Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-  KIMBALL  Oh no, I'm okay.  BATEMAN  It's no problem  Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down  in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters  and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched  glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman.  He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.  BATEMAN  Well, what's the topic of discussion?  KIMBALL  The disappearance of Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the  disappearance or anything... (Trying to laugh)  Not on \\\"Page Six\\\" at least.  KIMBALL  I think his family wants this kept quiet.  BATEMAN  Understandable.  (Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino)  Lime?  KIMBALL  No, really. I'm okay.  BATEMAN  You sure? I can always get you a lime.  A pause.  KIMBALL Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own  files, okay?  BATEMAN  Shoot.  KIMBALL  How old are you?  BATEMAN  Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.  KIMBALL  (Scribbling in his notebook)  Where did you go to school?  BATEMAN  Harvard. The Harvard Business School.  KIMBALL  Your address?  BATEMAN  Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.  KIMBALL  (Looking up, impressed)  Nice. Very nice.  BATEMAN  (Flattered)  Thanks.  A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his eyes, as if in pain.  KIMBALL  Pardon me, but are you okay?  BATEMAN  Who do you ask?  KIMBALL You seem...nervous.  Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a  bottle of aspirin.\",\n",

            "        \"text\": \"  \\n **AMERICAN PSYCHO**  by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner  Based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis   Fourth Draft  November 1998   INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT   An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side.  The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged  silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths  decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous  exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and  confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style:  pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala\\u00efa, Armani power suits.  CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.  WAITER  With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula  Caesar salad. For entr\\u00e9es tonight I have a swordfish  meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge  breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...  Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen  table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four  inches square and look exactly alike.  CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of  conversation. \\\"Is that Charlie Sheen over there?\\\" \\\"Excuse  me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet.\\\"  WAITER  And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our  pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...  CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate  perpendicular desserts descending on another table.  PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID  VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing  expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back  hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses.   The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:  BATEMAN (V.O.) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California  place on the Upper East Side.  The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately  decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's  description of each of the men at the table.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in  a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences  between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van  Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the  best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a  bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten  keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .   VAN PATTEN  What are the rules for a sweater vest?  McDERMOTT  What do you mean?  PRICE  Yes. Clarify.  McDERMOTT  Well, is it strictly informal-  BATEMAN  Or can it be worn with a suit?  McDERMOTT  (Smiling)  Exactly  BATEMAN  With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or  charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder  vest.  McDERMOTT  But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look  too studied.  VAN PATTEN  You think so?  PRICE  You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.  VAN PATTEN  Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.  Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy  discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.  BATEMAN  Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?  PRICE  It looks that way, doesn't it?  McDERMOTT  (Staring at retreating waiter)  Did he just take our plates away?  PRICE  He took them away because the portions are so small he  probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place.  This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?  McDERMOTT  Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. (He guffaws)  Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.  McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.  McDERMOTT  Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE  Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.  McDERMOTT  Who is it then?  PRICE  That's Paul Owen.  BATEMAN  That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.  He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back  hair and horn-rimmed glasses.  McDERMOTT  Who is he with?  PRICE  (Distracted by the waitress's  cleavage as she bends over to  uncork a bottle of wine \\u2013 the  waitress glares at him)  Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.  Van Patten returns.  VAN PATTEN  They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.  McDERMOTT  Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?  PRICE  Yes. McDufus, I am.  McDERMOTT  He's handling the Fisher account.  PRICE  Lucky bastard.  McDERMOTT  Lucky Jew bastard.  BATEMAN  Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with  anything?  McDERMOTT  Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The  bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.  BATEMAN  You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah.  You spin a dreidel.  McDERMOTT  Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?  BATEMAN  No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.  McDERMOTT  Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the  ACLU.  Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.  PRICE  The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking  of reasonable...  He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.  McDERMOTT  Only $470.  VAN PATTEN  (Without irony)  Not bad.  The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap down on the table.  INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT  Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is  lighting up a cigar.  McDERMOTT  Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-  VAN PATTEN  Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this  story again.  McDERMOTT  But I never told you what happened afterwards. So  okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big  tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I  buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on  spring break and she's practically blowing me in the  Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-  BATEMAN  Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all  this?  McDERMOTT  Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick  who's gonna let me-  VAN PATTEN  (Putting his hands over his ears)  I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something  disgusting.  McDERMOTT  You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op  together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some  chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.  Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.  McDERMOTT  Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to  this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking  rhino tipsy, and get this-  VAN PATTEN  She let you fuck her without a condom?  McDERMOTT  This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She  would only-are you ready?  (Dramatic pause)  She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept  her glove on.  The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.  ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.  EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT  The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel.  McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN,  who looks confused.  McDERMOTT  I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask  him if he takes American Express.  PRICE  (Offering card)  You take Amex, dude?  The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine,  unhooks the  velvet rope and welcomes them inside.  INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT   Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a  black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels.  MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls  stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the  counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as  women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they  wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple  lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes  past them and slams the door.  PRICE  There's this theory out now that if you can catch the  AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,  then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular  dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for  Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-  BATEMAN  I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a  virus.  PRICE  Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.  Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is  sweating.  PRICE  I'm shaking. You open it.  Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.  PRICE Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?  BATEMAN  Maybe it's just the light.  PRICE  Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips  the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort)  Oh my God...  BATEMAN  What?  PRICE  It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!  Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.  BATEMAN  It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do  enough of it we'll be okay.  PRICE  I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it  on my fucking All-Bran.  The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate  voice:  GUY IN STALL  Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!  Price pounds his fist against the stall.  PRICE  (screaming)  SHUT UP!  BATEMAN  Calm down. Let's do it anyway  PRICE  I guess you're right... (Raising his voice)  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!  GUY IN STALL  Fuck you!  PRICE  (Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider)  No, FUCK YOU!!  (He collapses, panting against the stall door)  Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.  BATEMAN  That's the spirit.  They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope  of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking  their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into  their gums.  INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT   Bateman saunters toward the bar as \\\"Pump Up the Volume\\\"  plays in the background.  BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.  He hands her two drink tickets.  BARGIRL  It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's  a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.  Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her  a $50.  She turns her back and searches the cash register for  change.  BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to  death and then play around with your blood.  The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is  smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.  INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING   Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light.  A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows  looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist  high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large  Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive  electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly  impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of  a design magazine.  BATEMAN (V.0.)  My name is Patrick Bateman. I am  twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden  Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh  floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.  Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to  see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his  toilet.  BATEMAN  (V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a  balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the  morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice  pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand  now.  Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.  Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living  room wearing the ice pack.  CUT TO:  A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the  shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  After I remove the icepack, I use a deep  pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a  water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body  scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.  Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a  gel facial masque.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which  I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my  routine.  Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is  stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He  begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in  readiness on the marble counter.  BATEMAN (V.O.) I always use an after-shave lotion with little  or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes  you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye  balm, followed by a final moisturizing \\\"protective\\\" lotion...  Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried,  giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been  wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque  off his face.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some  kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold  gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably  comparable: I simply am not there.  INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING   Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled  white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large  expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by  Bateman's interior decorator.  Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a  huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts,  shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and  tone.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  It is hard for me to make sense on any given  level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality  is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is  persistent.  Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a  full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom,  adjusting his cuff-links.  BATEMAN (V.0.)  My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared  a long time ago, if they ever did exist.  He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees.  He gives his reflection a smile.  INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE &amp; PIERCE - DAY   As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who  looks just like him.  MAN  Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.  Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling  his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive,  wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.  JEAN  Late?  BATEMAN  Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?  JEAN  Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what  he was canceling or why.  BATEMAN  I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.  Anyone else?  JEAN  And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.  BATEMAN  When?  JEAN  After six.  BATEMAN  Negative. Cancel it.  Jean follows him into his office.  JEAN  Oh? And what should I say?  BATEMAN Just...say...no.  JEAN  Just say no?  Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.  BATEMAN  Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols  at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All  right?  JEAN  (Playfully)  Yes, sir.  She turns to leave.  BATEMAN  Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight  tonight.  Jean turns around.  JEAN  Oh, something. . romantic?  BATEMAN  No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.  JEAN  I'll do it.  BATEMAN  No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?  JEAN  You look nice today.  Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his  office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a  slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a  beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a  Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment  later with the Perrier and a file.  JEAN  Yes?  BATEMAN  Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that  outfit again.  JEAN  Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.  BATEMAN  I said \\\"Do not wear that outfit again.\\\" Wear a  dress. A skirt or something.  Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.  JEAN  (Smiling bravely)  You don't like this, I take it?  BATEMAN  Come on, you're prettier than that.  JEAN  (Sarcastically)  Thanks, Patrick.  The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.  BATEMAN  I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.  As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner  of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!  INT. TAXI - EVENING   EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's  fianc\\u00e9e, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping  a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically  beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with  herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a  small child.  EVELYN  I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd  want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something  ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots  of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.  CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring  out the window.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I'm trying to listen to the new George  Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc\\u00e9e-keeps buzzing  in my ear.  Evelyn continues to make notes.  EVELYN  Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses.  Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.  And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.  BATEMAN  (Removing his Walkman)  Do...what.  EVELYN  Get married. Have a wedding.  BATEMAN  Evelyn?  EVELYN  Yes, darling?  BATEMAN  Is your Evian spiked?  EVELYN  We should do it.  BATEMAN  No-I can't take the time off work.  EVELYN  Your father practically owns the company. You can do  anything you like, silly.  BATEMAN  I don't want to talk about it.  EVELYN  Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just  quit? You don't have to work.  BATEMAN  Because I...want...to...fit...in.  The taxi bumps to a halt.  INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT   A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in  self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed  plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel  smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are  made of extremely uncomfortable  bolted steel.  BATEMAN (V.O.)  I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace  since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do,  and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.  Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are  already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen,  with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with  ragged black hair and bad skin.  They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus  that look like minimalist art.  PRICE  The menu's in braille.  He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long  kiss.  PRICE  I have to talk to you.  He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.  EVELYN  (Over her shoulder)  Pat, this is my cousin Vanden  and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.  BATEMAN  (After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and  checking his hair)  Hi. Pat Bateman.  Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.  BATEMAN  Let me guess-you live in the East Village?  Pause.  STASH  SoHo.  COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table.  Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from  precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is  considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is  half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a  rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He  wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and  Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets,  bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.  They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back,  Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.  COURTNEY  (Whispering)  Stop it!  Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.  LATER:  Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is  quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching  Evelyn and Price.  BATEMAN (V.O.) I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn  are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s  usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight  I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use,  though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers,  the biggest dufus in the business.  Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.  COURTNEY Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is  becoming to...commercial?  CARRUTHERS  Yes, I read that.  PRICE  Oh, who gives a rat's ass?  VANDEN  Hey. That affects us.  PRICE  (Wired on coke)  Oh ho ho. That affects us? What  about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that  affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri  Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of  Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?  BATEMAN  Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important  problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign  policy is important, but there are more pressing problems  at hand.  PRICE  Like what?  BATEMAN  Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow  down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world  hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We  have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We  have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and  oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while  also promoting equal rights for women but change the  abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still  somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.  The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.  BATEMAN  We also have to control the influx of illegal  immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional  moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in  movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have  to promote general social concern and less materialism in  young people.  Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and  mystified.  CARRUTHERS  Patrick, how thought-provoking.  INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING   Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.  BATEMAN  Why don t you just go for Price?  EVELYN  Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?  BATEMAN  He's rich.  EVELYN  Everybody's rich.  BATEMAN  He's good-looking.  EVELYN  Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.  BATEMAN  He has a great body  EVELYN  Everybody has a great body now.  Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get  Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the  Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally,  he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to  look around him at the TV, then takes notice.  EVELYN  What do you want to do with that, floss with it?  Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.  EVELYN  Are you using minoxidil?  BATEMAN  No. I'm not. Why should I ?  EVELYN  Your hairline looks like it's receding.\",\n",

He is becoming a little aggressive with his kink. He told me at the beginning of our relationship that he thinks that me wearing fox ears during sex is adorable and hot. I thought it was cute too so I played along. I'm usually the dominant one in our relationship and it fit well into that narrative. But now it's becoming more present in our relationship than I'd like. He wants me to wear the ears all the time, and he literally talks to me in baby talk (the way you'd talk to a dog in public). We went to target and while I was looking for some birthday cards for my dad, he said \\\"Aww you're being such a good girl, I wish you had your little fox tail to wag\\\". Ive told him many times that I'd like to be treated like a human in public. He's also upped the antics since then, he's gotten me a fox tail butt plug, which I've told him makes me feel uncomfortable. But he is relentless about me wearing it. Tonight we started kissing and he slipped the ears over my head. Maybe it's crazy but I felt a little hurt and asked him if he liked me for me or for the fox persona I put on for him.

A good portion of my classmates are now dead from either gun violence, stabbings or drug overdoses. My school never talked about college, or did anything to help us with the college process. We never even took the SAT. I would say that probably only 20% of my graduating class went to college right away. I was left ill equipped and clueless.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my cousin, who is a senior, is graduating with 24 college credits towards physical therapy, her intended major. She has over $20k in scholarships, too. Her high school has a 100% college acceptance rate, and is full of well off families. She plays volleyball, does weight lifting and somehow works on the weekends. She also constantly makes the honor roll and has a healthy social life. Her school is the total opposite of what I went through. Her school integrates college and career readiness into their curriculum, and even allows students time off to tour colleges. Since she is going for physical therapy, her advisor set up a meeting for her to go and talk one on one with a physical therapist and go take a half day off school to shadow this physical therapist at her practice. \\n\\nMy cousins experience isn\\u2019t the only reason I am writing this post. I\\u2019ve been dating recently, and all of the guys I\\u2019ve talked to or went on a date who are my age (23), seem to be doing quite well. Many are in graduate school and/or have good paying jobs. They all seem to be very stable, too. Maybe it\\u2019s the class of people I come from, but I cannot wrap my head around being stable at this point in my life. One guy that I brought this up with said that he had lots of guidance in high school which allowed him to explore his interests and ultimately pick a good career.\",\n",

I just read someone from my age saying x place is bad due its \\\"filled with teenagers and their infamous mood swings\\\" (lol adults have mood swings too, it isn't exclusively for teenagers). I think it\\u2019s more of a maturity issue than a generational one. I know a lot of teenagers that are pretty chill while I know a lot of adults that are cringe (adults who complain about teenagers are one of them). Also, bullying minors for the sake of being teenagers is pretty creepy and even illegal.\\n\\n The fact that arguing with an immature adult is worse than arguing with a immature teenager just prove my point. I probably feel pity for teenagers being unfairly blamed by everything since I was also discriminated by adults for being 16 (a teen) years ago and most of my online friends are either people  around my age or more younger (mid or even late 00). Sometimes I feel ashamed of being an adult when a lot lack common sense.\",\n",

So I'd say I have a pretty wide Z range of siblings with them being on complete opposite Z spectrum's.\\n\\nFor my older sister she was still 22 when Covid hit (because her b-day hadn't happened yet) and she was an RN at our local nursing home so she works in healthcare. The virus I'd say hit her the hardest whenever it started they just made the employees wear masks and goggles but in early 2021 they made the vaccine mandatory at her work and if you didn't get it you got fired, so she got it. As of today it's still the same, she has to wear a mask with goggles lol (I say lol because she looks hilarious with the goggles over her glasses) and when she goes into the \\\"high risk\\\" patients area she also has to wear a face shield.\\n\\nAs for me I was still 16 when Covid hit (because my b-day hadn't happened yet) and I was at the tail end of my Junior year (HS) and from mid March - mid April we had to do work at home on our computers, not any zoom meetings just good ole digital worksheet's. Then in mid April my school board decides to say \\\"F it\\\" and we didn't have to do work anymore so from mid April through the rest of the school year we didn't have to do work. The 2020 class's graduation was postponed from May to June so they graduated a month later than they normally would've, and they're graduation was normal it was on the football field and you didn't have to wear a mask, just like a normal pre-covid graduation. \\n\\nThen my Senior year was starting in August 2020 and our school board gave us 2 options, 1- you could go to school but have to wear a mask or 2- you can become homeschooled, I went with the homeschooled option. Our work was insanely easy we would get on this website called \\\"plato.web\\\" and there were different assignments for us to do and you could just copy and paste the problem onto a website called \\\"brianly\\\" and it gave you the answer to everyone so everyday I got done within an hour and had the whole rest of the school day to do whatever I wanted. In all honesty I liked this more than \\\"normal\\\" HS. Fast forward to October I get done because all I needed was one credit and I got that credit and I had a good ole fashioned graduation in May like I would've pre-covid, no masks, no nothing.\\n\\nAs for my younger brother he had just turned 14 when Covid hit and was about to graduate 8th grade. He didn't have an 8th grade graduation so that was something different, As for his freshman year of HS he done it homeschooled (like me) and got done extremely fast everyday like me. He's now a sophomore in HS and his sophomore year has been normal, all sporting events are going on, they have pep rallies, and don't have to wear masks. He's currently living a \\\"normal\\\" HS life.\\n\\nAs for my younger sister she had just turned 11 when Covid hit and was about to graduate 5th grade, she didn't have a 5th grade graduation so that was different. As for her 6th grade year she was homeschooled like me and my brother and she also got done with her work extremely early everyday. Currently she's in 7th grade and is living a normal middle school life like how I did, she doesn't have to wear a mask, goes to school everyday, and all sporting events and the like are going on.\\n\\nAs for my community, Covid didn't really hit here until late 2020 and was only a problem from late 2020 - early 2021, so ever since then I along with everyone in my community has been living a normal life, we don't have to wear masks anywhere, unless you're in healthcare you don't have to be vaccinated FOR ANYTHING, every restaurant and the like are wide open and are welcome to all. Currently I'm living my life like Covid is dead, basically everything I could do pre-covid I can do now where I live. \\n\\nI was just wanted to give people a different perspective on how Covid has affected people especially in the rural south since that's where I'm at, here Covid is basically dead nobody really has it and the school students are living normal school lives unlike some in bigger cities. No zoom no nothing just plain old pre-covid school.\",\n",
